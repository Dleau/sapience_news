918,18329,"In Age of Trump, Scientists Show Signs of a Political Pulse - The New York Times",New York Times,Amy Harmon and Henry Fountain,2017-04-22,2017.0,4.0,,"Michael Eisen, an evolutionary biologist, is among the elite of American scientists, with a tenured position at the University of California, Berkeley, and generous funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for his research on fruit flies. But late last month, dismayed over the Trump administration’s apparent disdain for evidence on climate change and other issues, Dr. Eisen registered the Twitter handle @SenatorPhD and declared his intention to run in the 2018 election for a seat in the United States Senate from California. His campaign slogan: “Liberty, Equality, Reality. ” “I’m not sure I’m the best vehicle for this,” said Dr. Eisen, whose professional attire consists of shorts and   bearing mottos supporting open access to scientific literature, a cause he has championed. “But if we want to defend the role of science in policy making, scientists need to run for office. ” Since Mr. Trump’s election, many other scientists have expressed concern about rumors and public statements on the new administration’s views on science, climate change and the role of federal offices like the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax (although more recently said he would have an “open mind” about it) and appointed some officials to his transition team who dispute mainstream climate science. But there is much that is still unclear about his administration’s attitudes toward science. The president has yet to appoint a science adviser and has not responded to open letters calling on him to do so from science policy groups including the American Association for the Advancement of Science (whose president, Rush D. Holt, is a physicist and former congressman). Few scientists have gone as far as Dr. Eisen, but other researchers are now undergoing a political awakening, contemplating what their role should be for at least the next few years. “There are many conversations going on right now,” said Naomi Oreskes, a historian of science at Harvard who spoke at one of the first     protests, a rally in San Francisco during the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December. “Many scientists do feel that the time for sitting on the sidelines is past. ” A political action committee that seeks to get more scientists and engineers to run for elective office, 314 Action, has seen a surge of interest in its programs, with more than 2, 000 people registering at its website. The group is planning a training program for   whether they want to run for local or state offices or Congress. Other scientists have organized demonstrations  —   including a march now set for Earth Day, April 22  —   submitted letters or opinion articles to news organizations or joined efforts to preserve government data that they fear may otherwise disappear. Individuals and groups have also spoken out against Mr. Trump’s executive order restricting travel for citizens of Iran, Iraq and five other countries, an action that has affected some researchers. But an activist role is not an easy fit for many scientists. “I have plenty of colleagues who say, ‘Leave me alone in my lab,’” said Jonathan Overpeck, director of the Institute for the Environment at the University of Arizona. Still, he has seen more scientists take at least the first steps toward mobilization. “Right now it’s mostly talking about what to do,” he said. “We’re scientists  —   we tend to plan very carefully what we do and then we try to do it well. But certainly there’s an elevated sense that this is very real. ” That sense has motivated hundreds of student and faculty volunteers at nearly a dozen universities to participate in “data rescue” events over the last two months, the most recent of which was held this weekend at New York University. After a brief training session, participants spent six hours archiving environmental data from government websites, including those of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Interior Department. An anonymous donor has provided storage on Amazon servers, and the information can be searched from a website at the University of Pennsylvania called Data Refuge. Though the Federal Records Act theoretically protects government data from deletion, scientists who rely on it say would rather be safe than sorry. “For a problem like climate change, you can’t understand it if you don’t have data,” said Jerome Whitington, an environmental anthropologist and member of the   group Environmental Data Governance Initiative, which sponsored the N. Y. U. event. Much of the concern among scientists has been centered on the E. P. A. which was a favorite target of Mr. Trump during the campaign. Comments by members of his transition team have led to speculation that the new administration would gut the agency’s science staff. Although he said he was speaking only for himself, Myron Ebell, who headed the E. P. A. transition but left on Jan. 19, said in a recent interview that science within the agency had become too politicized. “I’m a great believer in science,” Mr. Ebell said, “but I’m not a great believer in politicized science. ” Many scientists would argue that it is climate deniers and others who are politicized. The question of whether scientists should take sides politically is an old one, with the widespread and   view among many researchers that they should be quiet and let their data speak for itself. Some scientists have objected to plans for the Washington march, arguing that the event will feed the view among many conservatives that scientists have a political agenda. But the idea that they should be above the fray has been slowly unraveling as researchers realize that their own aloofness may largely be to blame for public disregard for the evidence on issues like climate change or vaccine safety. And in the era of Trump, some say it could finally come completely apart. “I think that many people have moved well beyond that,” said Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, which is enlisting scientists to monitor what is occurring in federal agencies. “It’s nonsense  —   you need to follow your own heart. You can do science and still be a good citizen. ” Youth is leading the way in rejecting the old view, Mr. Rosenberg said. “Early career scientists, younger scientists  —   that’s not an answer for them,” he said. Chanda   a cosmologist and particle physicist at the University of Washington, is one of those younger researchers. She has long been politically active  —   she comes from a family of organizers and attended her first demonstration when she was 2 months old  —   but for her the talk and actions of the Trump administration have led to a new level of concern. Dr.   said she was especially incensed by what she and others viewed as efforts by some science organizations to reach out to the Trump administration. Immediately after the election, she took to social media to criticize a news release from the American Physical Society that urged President Trump to strengthen scientific leadership and quoted his campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again. ” “What history has taught us is that collaboration doesn’t work for science,” Dr.   said. “When we work with extremist, racist, Islamophobic or nationalist governments, it doesn’t work for science. ” The news release was quickly withdrawn and the society apologized for any “offense it might have caused. ” Michael Lubell, a physics professor who was director of public affairs for the society but who was terminated without explanation, said that “initially people were very worried that if anybody criticized Donald Trump there would be retribution. ” “People are now getting to the point where they are understanding that this is a guy in the White House who doesn’t have a firm grasp on science policy at all,” Dr. Lubell said. “Now they are mobilizing. But there’s absolutely no strategy. ” Dr. Eisen, the Berkeley biologist, would seem to have slim chances of winning a race for the Senate, since it is sure to be joined by several prominent Democrats if Dianne Feinstein, the longtime incumbent, decides not to run. But Jacquelyn Gill, a   at the University of Maine’s Climate Change Institute, has been actively recruited to  —   eventually  —   make a bid for a congressional seat by 314 Action, ever since she was quoted in the journal Nature urging her fellow scientists to “do more than write letters. ” Staff members at 314 Action (which takes its name from the number pi) liked her attitude, and she happens to live in a swing district. Like many academic scientists, Dr. Gill employs several graduate students in her laboratory and has received grant funds for research that is still in progress. But the idea of public service, at what she considers an urgent time for climate science, is tugging at her. “I came into this career wanting to do science that’s in the public good,” she said. “And maybe now that means something different than it did before. ”"
1233,18677,"A Back-Channel Plan for Ukraine and Russia, Courtesy of Trump Associates - The New York Times",New York Times,Megan Twohey and Scott Shane,2017-02-21,2017.0,2.0,,"A week before Michael T. Flynn resigned as national security adviser, a sealed proposal was   to his office, outlining a way for President Trump to lift sanctions against Russia. Mr. Flynn is gone, having been caught lying about his own discussion of sanctions with the Russian ambassador. But the proposal, a peace plan for Ukraine and Russia, remains, along with those pushing it: Michael D. Cohen, the president’s personal lawyer, who delivered the document Felix H. Sater, a business associate who helped Mr. Trump scout deals in Russia and a Ukrainian lawmaker trying to rise in a political opposition movement shaped in part by Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort. At a time when Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia, and the people connected to him, are under heightened scrutiny  —   with investigations by American intelligence agencies, the F. B. I. and Congress  —   some of his associates remain willing and eager to wade into   efforts behind the scenes. Mr. Trump has confounded Democrats and Republicans alike with his repeated praise for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and his desire to forge an   alliance. While there is nothing illegal about such unofficial efforts, a proposal that seems to tip toward Russian interests may set off alarms. The amateur diplomats say their goal is simply to help settle a grueling,   conflict that has cost 10, 000 lives. “Who doesn’t want to help bring about peace?” Mr. Cohen asked. But the proposal contains more than just a peace plan. Andrii V. Artemenko, the Ukrainian lawmaker, who sees himself as a   leader of a future Ukraine, claims to have evidence  —   “names of companies, wire transfers”  —   showing corruption by the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, that could help oust him. And Mr. Artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides to Mr. Putin. “A lot of people will call me a Russian agent, a U. S. agent, a C. I. A. agent,” Mr. Artemenko said. “But how can you find a good solution between our countries if we do not talk?” Mr. Cohen and Mr. Sater said they had not spoken to Mr. Trump about the proposal, and have no experience in foreign policy. Mr. Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an F. B. I. counterintelligence examination of links with Russia, according to law enforcement officials he has denied any illicit connections. The two others involved in the effort have somewhat questionable pasts: Mr. Sater, 50, a   pleaded guilty to a role in a stock manipulation scheme decades ago that involved the Mafia. Mr. Artemenko spent two and a half years in jail in Kiev in the early 2000s on embezzlement charges, later dropped, which he said had been politically motivated. While it is unclear if the White House will take the proposal seriously, the diplomatic freelancing has infuriated Ukrainian officials. Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States, Valeriy Chaly, said Mr. Artemenko “is not entitled to present any alternative peace plans on behalf of Ukraine to any foreign government, including the U. S. administration. ” At a security conference in Munich on Friday, Mr. Poroshenko warned the West against “appeasement” of Russia, and some American experts say offering Russia any alternative to a    international agreement on Ukraine would be a mistake. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about the conflict in Ukraine. But given Mr. Trump’s praise for Mr. Putin, John Herbst, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, said he feared the new president might be too eager to mend relations with Russia at Ukraine’s expense  —   potentially with a plan like Mr. Artemenko’s. It was late January when the three men associated with the proposed plan converged on the Loews Regency, a luxury hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan where business deals are made in a lobby furnished with leather couches, over martinis at the restaurant bar and in private conference rooms on upper floors. Mr. Cohen, 50, lives two blocks up the street, in Trump Park Avenue. A lawyer who joined the Trump Organization in 2007 as special counsel, he has worked on many deals, including a   tower in the republic of Georgia and a   mixed martial arts venture starring a Russian fighter. He is considered a loyal lieutenant whom Mr. Trump trusts to fix difficult problems. The F. B. I. is reviewing an unverified dossier, compiled by a former British intelligence agent and funded by Mr. Trump’s political opponents, that claims Mr. Cohen met with a Russian representative in Prague during the presidential campaign to discuss Russia’s hacking of Democratic targets. But the Russian official named in the report told The New York Times that he had never met Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen insists that he has never visited Prague and that the dossier’s assertions are fabrications. (Mr. Manafort is also under investigation by the F. B. I. for his connections to Russia and Ukraine.) Mr. Cohen has a personal connection to Ukraine: He is married to a Ukrainian woman and once worked with relatives there to establish an ethanol business. Mr. Artemenko, tall and burly, arrived at the Manhattan hotel between visits to Washington. (His wife, he said, met the first lady, Melania Trump, years ago during their modeling careers, but he did not try to meet Mr. Trump.) He had attended the inauguration and visited Congress, posting on Facebook his admiration for Mr. Trump and talking up his peace plan in meetings with American lawmakers. He entered Parliament in 2014, the year that the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych fled to Moscow amid protests over his economic alignment with Russia and corruption. Mr. Manafort, who had been instrumental in getting Mr. Yanukovych elected, helped shape a political bloc that sprang up to oppose the new president, Mr. Poroshenko, a wealthy businessman who has taken a far tougher stance toward Russia and accused Mr. Putin of wanting to absorb Ukraine into a new Russian Empire. Mr. Artemenko, 48, emerged from the opposition that Mr. Manafort nurtured. (The two men have never met, Mr. Artemenko said.) Before entering politics, Mr. Artemenko had business ventures in the Middle East and real estate deals in the Miami area, and had worked as an agent representing top Ukrainian athletes. Some colleagues in Parliament describe him as corrupt, untrustworthy or simply insignificant, but he appears to have amassed considerable wealth. He has fashioned himself in the image of Mr. Trump, presenting himself as Ukraine’s answer to a rising class of nationalist leaders in the West. He even traveled to Cleveland last summer for the Republican National Convention, seizing on the chance to meet with members of Mr. Trump’s campaign. “It’s time for new leaders, new approaches to the governance of the country, new principles and new negotiators in international politics,” he wrote on Facebook on Jan. 27. “Our time has come!” Mr. Artemenko said he saw in Mr. Trump an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in Ukraine  —   and help advance his own political career. Essentially, his plan would require the withdrawal of all Russian forces from eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian voters would decide in a referendum whether Crimea, the Ukrainian territory seized by Russia in 2014, would be leased to Russia for a term of 50 or 100 years. The Ukrainian ambassador, Mr. Chaly, rejected a lease of that kind. “It is a gross violation of the Constitution,” he said in written answers to questions from The Times. “Such ideas can be pitched or pushed through only by those openly or covertly representing Russian interests. ” The reaction suggested why Mr. Artemenko’s project also includes the dissemination of “kompromat,” or compromising material, purportedly showing that Mr. Poroshenko and his closest associates are corrupt. Only a new government, presumably one less hostile to Russia, might take up his plan. Mr. Sater, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump’s with connections in Russia, was willing to help Mr. Artemenko’s proposal reach the White House. Mr. Trump has sought to distance himself from Mr. Sater in recent years. If Mr. Sater “were sitting in the room right now,” Mr. Trump said in a 2013 deposition, “I really wouldn’t know what he looked like. ” But Mr. Sater worked on real estate development deals with the Trump Organization on and off for at least a decade, even after his role in the stock manipulation scheme came to light. Mr. Sater, who was born in the Soviet Union and grew up in New York, served as an executive at a firm called Bayrock Group, two floors below the Trump Organization in Trump Tower, and was later a senior adviser to Mr. Trump. He said he had been working on a plan for a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Russian real estate developer as recently as the fall of 2015, one that he said had come to a halt because of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. (Mr. Cohen said the Trump Organization had received a letter of intent for a project in Moscow from a Russian real estate developer at that time but determined that the project was not feasible.) Mr. Artemenko said a mutual friend had put him in touch with Mr. Sater. Helping to advance the proposal, Mr. Sater said, made sense. “I want to stop a war, number one,” he said. “Number two, I absolutely believe that the U. S. and Russia need to be allies, not enemies. If I could achieve both in one stroke, it would be a home run. ” After speaking with Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko in person, Mr. Cohen said he would deliver the plan to the White House. Mr. Cohen said he did not know who in the Russian government had offered encouragement on it, as Mr. Artemenko claims, but he understood there was a promise of proof of corruption by the Ukrainian president. “Fraud is never good, right?” Mr. Cohen said. He said Mr. Sater had given him the written proposal in a sealed envelope. When Mr. Cohen met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in early February, he said, he left the proposal in Mr. Flynn’s office. Mr. Cohen said he was waiting for a response when Mr. Flynn was forced from his post. Now Mr. Cohen, Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko are hoping a new national security adviser will take up their cause. On Friday the president wrote on Twitter that he had four new candidates for the job."
5101,22952,"Obama, Trump and the Turf War That Has Come to Define the Transition - The New York Times",New York Times,Mark Landler,2017-04-14,2017.0,4.0,,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump and President Obama have been unfailingly polite toward each other since the election. But with Mr. Trump staking out starkly different positions from Mr. Obama on Israel and other sensitive issues, and the president acting aggressively to protect his legacy, the two have become leaders of what amounts to dueling administrations. The split widened on Friday when the Obama administration abstained from a United Nations Security Council vote that condemned Israel for Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and allowed the resolution to pass. A day earlier, Mr. Trump had publicly demanded that Mr. Obama veto the measure, even intervening with Egypt at the request of Israel to pressure the administration to shelve the effort. “As to the U. N.,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter after the vote, “things will be different after Jan. 20. ” It was the latest in a   series of Twitter posts and public statements over the last week in which Mr. Trump has weighed in on Israel, terrorism and nuclear proliferation  —   contradicting Mr. Obama and flouting the notion that the country can have only one president at a time. That longstanding principle has largely collapsed since the victory by Mr. Trump, who campaigned on a strategy of breaking all the rules and has continued to speak in unmodulated tones. “In some ways, Trump is neutering the Obama administration,” said Douglas G. Brinkley, a professor of history and a presidential historian at Rice University in Houston. “They’ve avoided personally attacking each other, but behind the scenes, they’re working to undermine each other, and I don’t know how the American people benefit from that. ” For its part, the Obama administration on Tuesday announced a permanent ban on offshore oil and gas drilling along wide areas of the Arctic and the Eastern Seaboard, invoking an obscure provision of a 1953 law, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, to claim that Mr. Trump had no power to reverse it. White House officials asserted a similar privilege in their decision not to veto the Security Council resolution. Israel’s aggressive construction of settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, they said, puts at risk a   solution to the   conflict. Mr. Trump’s opposition to the measure, and the likelihood that his administration will reverse the position, played no part in the decision, they said. “There’s one president at a time,” said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser. “There’s a principle here that the world understands who is speaking for the United States until January 20th, and who is speaking for the United States after January 20th. ” In the last week, Mr. Trump has written on Twitter that the United States “must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability” accused China of an “unprecedented act” in seizing a United States Navy underwater drone in the South China Sea and then, after the Pentagon and the Chinese negotiated the drone’s return, suggested that the United States should “let them keep it!” He condemned the deadly truck rampage at a Christmas market in Berlin as an “attack on humanity,” which he also said vindicated his proposed ban on immigration from countries plagued by Islamic extremism. On Friday, Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter post that the suspect in the attack had made a religiously motivated threat. “When will the U. S. and all countries, fight back?” he wrote. Mr. Trump’s pronouncements are often so vague and offhand that their   impact on policy is open to debate. But his intervention to press Egypt to delay the Security Council vote disrupted a sensitive diplomatic negotiation, and muddied perhaps Mr. Obama’s final opportunity to make a statement on the stalled Middle East peace process. When Egypt buckled, the same resolution was brought to a vote by four other countries on the Security Council: Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal and Venezuela. The United States watched the proceedings largely from the sidelines. On Friday morning, Mr. Obama, from his vacation home in Hawaii, directed his national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, to tell the ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, not to block the resolution. “In a practical sense, the message this sends is that the Obama administration is over,” said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to both Egypt and Israel. “Everybody knows this resolution doesn’t carry any weight. The assumption has to be that the Israeli government will take some retaliatory measures. Knowing that Trump is coming into office, and knowing that Trump tried to oppose this, they will do so with impunity. ” This role reversal between the departing and incoming presidents deepened what was already an unsettled moment in American foreign policy: a sense that the White House’s policies toward the world’s most troubled places had run out of steam and were about to change radically, but in ways that were wholly unpredictable. Mr. Trump has been careful to be respectful of his predecessor, and the  ’s aides have said that the two men have spoken often. When people at his rallies jeer at the mention of Mr. Obama’s name, Mr. Trump hushes them  —   a courtesy he does not extend to his former opponent, Hillary Clinton. But Mr. Trump has shown little patience for the traditions of the interregnum between presidents. “President Obama and his team have been unbelievably gracious to the   and his team, but at the end of the day, he’s not someone that’s going to sit back and wait,” Sean Spicer, whom Mr. Trump named on Thursday as White House press secretary, said on CNN. Noting the close alliance between Israel and the United States, Mr. Spicer said, “It is something that we should protect, and he wanted to make it very clear that anything that undermined Israel, which is a great friend of the United States, he was going to make sure his voice was heard. ” It is not unprecedented for future presidents to dip into foreign affairs before taking office. During his transition in 1968, Richard M. Nixon dispatched two aides, Henry A. Kissinger and Robert Ellsworth, to meet with Soviet officials to pass along his views on a nonproliferation treaty and a summit meeting, an idea that was being pushed by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Nixon later wrote that he “did not want to be boxed in by any decisions that were made” before he took office. More often, though, incoming presidents have been  . In December 1932, the departing president, Herbert Hoover, was deeply frustrated when Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had won a landslide victory a month earlier, declined to work with him on the issue of war debts owed to the United States by Britain and France. “Governor Roosevelt considers it undesirable for him to assent to my suggestions for cooperative action,” he said. Eliot A. Cohen, a Republican foreign policy expert who worked in the George W. Bush administration and is a critic of Mr. Trump, said the   was still communicating in the style of a political candidate. “I don’t think he has a good sense of how every word that comes out of his mouth can have real consequences,” he said. Whatever their frustrations about his interference, White House officials were careful not to criticize Mr. Trump after the Security Council vote. And in his Twitter message promising change at the United Nations, Mr. Trump pointedly did not criticize Mr. Obama or his administration. Still, Mr. Trump has shown no sign that he will surrender his Twitter account or curb his public statements in the next 28 days, which could lead to more mixed messages and tension with the White House. Experts have said Mr. Trump would do well to follow the example of his reticent predecessors. “This is not politesse,” said Michael Beschloss, the presidential historian. “Even a   who has been in public life for a long time has not been fully briefed or fully staffed, and hence may be in a position to do this better once he’s in the White House. ” “What’s the rush?” he said."

8609,27345,Report: Former Trump National Security Advisor Mike Flynn Offers to Testify for Immunity,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,2017-03-30,2017.0,3.0,,"President Donald Trump’s former national security advisor, Ret. Gen. Mike Flynn, has reportedly offered his testimony in the investigation into Russian ties to the president in exchange for immunity, a report says. [Flynn has reportedly asked for immunity should his testimony lead to any finding of wrong doing, according to a Thursday report by the Wall Street Journal.  The Journal claims that Flynn, a retired army general, and Trump campaign adviser, made his offer to the FBI and the House and Senate intelligence committees through his lawyer. Officials have not yet accepted the deal, the paper says. Details of what Flynn might be willing to say to investigators have not been made public. Flynn was appointed as then   Trump’s national security advisor in November of last year but resigned by February after revelations emerged that he had opened communications with Russian officials, communications about which he neglected to fully brief the vice president. In his resignation letter, Flynn apologized for neglecting to fully inform VP Pence about the discussions he had with the Russian ambassador saying the omission was due to the “fast pace of events. ” At the time of the resignation, Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the administration let Flynn go not due to any legal issues but due to “a trust issue. ” Spicer said that the “level of trust between the President and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change. ” Flynn is facing pressure from several inquiries into his dealings with Russian officials which include thousands he was paid by a trio of Russian companies for speeches made before he joined Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, as well as his communications with the Russian ambassador. Flynn’s offer to testify comes as Democrats continue to press for investigations into ties Trump may have had with Russia. To date there has been no direct ties proven between Trump or his campaign for president and Russia.

10544,29280,New Mexico Science Teacher Goes ’Breaking Bad’ with Illegal Meth Business,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,2017-05-03,2017.0,5.0,,"An   teacher stands accused of using his knowledge of science to launch an illegal methamphetamine manufacturing business, echoing the popular TV show, “Breaking Bad. ”[Las Cruces police arrested John W. Gose, 56, who once taught school in Las Cruces and El Paso, New Mexico, and charged him after a traffic stop with manufacturing the illegal drug .  Gose was found with lab equipment thought to be part of his   operations. Testing later revealed traces of meth. At his home, investigators later discovered traces of meth and other supplies and chemicals to produce the drug. The former teacher pleaded guilty before District Judge Fernando R. Macias in 3rd Judicial District Court in Las Cruces, according to the Doña Ana District Attorney’s Office. Gose spent almost nine years reaching in the El Paso Independent School District, resigning in 2008 to become a vocational teacher at Oñate High School in Las Cruces. After spending only one semester at Oñate High School, Gose took a job teaching   science at Camino Real Middle School where he worked until February of 2016. “That the defendant, in this case, chose to plead guilty to all of the charges is a testament to the strength of the investigation,” District Attorney Mark D’Antonio said in statement according to the Las Cruces  . “Thanks to the hard work of the Las Cruces Police Department, the New Mexico State Police and the prosecutors in this office, we are able to close the books on this case of life imitating art while saving the taxpayers of New Mexico the cost of a jury trial. ” The   teacher’s story mirrors the plot of the AMC series “Breaking Bad,” the story of   Walter White who turns to illegal drug production to make enough money for his family after he dies of cancer. While Mr. Gose doesn’t have cancer, his actions are otherwise similar to the series. Gose Pleaded guilty to four counts and will undergo a   evaluation period before sentencing. He could face a maximum of 20 and   years in prison. Parents at Camino Real Middle School were shocked by the court’s revelations. “I’m still trying to wrap my head around it.

11381,30117,Republicans Complain Planned Parenthood Defunding Provision Endangering Obamacare Repeal - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,2017-03-03,2017.0,3.0,,"Some Republican lawmakers are complaining the Obamacare repeal bill that contains the provision to eliminate Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding will make repeal of the healthcare law more difficult. [“I don’t think it makes sense to have the defunding of Planned Parenthood linked to this issue at all,” said Sen. Susan Collins ( ) according to The Hill. “If the House Republicans want to bring it up, it should be in a separate bill. I would oppose that bill, but it further complicates the negotiations to have it included in this bill. ”  “I think we should also separate out the Planned Parenthood issue from the broader healthcare issue,” Rep. Charlie Dent ( ) also said. “I think healthcare reform is controversial and complex enough without Planned Parenthood. Why put it in? It makes this whole exercise more difficult. ” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in January that the Obamacare repeal bill would also defund Planned Parenthood. With the use of the reconciliation budgetary procedure, Republicans would need 50 votes in the Senate to pass the legislation. In February, Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( ) announced she would not be voting with fellow Republicans for an Obamacare repeal bill that defunds Planned Parenthood. “Taxpayer dollars should never be used to pay for abortions, but I will not vote to deny Alaskans access to the health services that Planned Parenthood provides,” she said. “‪It’s illogical for any senator to claim she does not want tax dollars being used to fund abortion, while at the same time insisting that the federal government continue to lavish money on Planned Parenthood,” Dr. Grazie Pozo Christie, a policy advisor for The Catholic Association, tells Breitbart News. “As long as Planned Parenthood continues to perform abortions, and especially as long as abortion is their core business, they should not receive the   money of American taxpayers,” she adds. “Any tax money redirected to Comprehensive Community Health Centers from the abortion giant will only enhance and increase medical services for   women. ” Members of the   base of the GOP have stood by for years as GOP congressional leaders have explained they would need to wait for a   Senate and a Republican president in the White House to eliminate taxpayer funding for the nation’s largest abortion business. With Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress and a Republican administration now in place in the White House, the expectation is that goal will finally be realized. Trump made four promises to his   constituents: Liberal Republican members of Congress, however, have placed their support for Planned Parenthood ahead of their party’s attempts to pass other legislation in the past. Murkowski joined Collins and former Sen. Mark Kirk ( ) in 2015 to try to remove a provision to end Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding from the Obamacare repeal bill. In 2011, Collins received a personal “ ” letter from Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards, who expressed her gratitude that the Maine senator voted to continue funding her abortion business: Thank you for standing up for the millions of Americans who rely on Planned Parenthood for their primary and preventive health care. Your leadership and voice of support during the FY11 continuing resolution debate was essential to defeating the most dangerous legislative attack in our   history. With your help, Planned Parenthood survived and emerged stronger than ever  …     I am grateful for your tremendous leadership and partnership, and I look forward to working together in the future. Warm Regards, Cecile Richards, PPFA President, Richards added her own personal note to the letter as well, writing, “Senator Collins  —   Thank you for your leadership on women’s health and your support for the three million patients who will visit Planned Parenthood this year. We are enormously grateful. Cecile Richards. ” Planned Parenthood performs over 300, 000 abortions per year and receives more than a half billion dollars annually in taxpayer funding."

14355,33091,Vogue Editor Anna Wintour: ’No Point About Whining Or Complaining’ Over Trump Administration - Breitbart,Breitbart,John Binder,2017-04-26,2017.0,4.0,,"NEW YORK CITY, New York  —   Vogue    Anna Wintour says there is “no point about whining or complaining or screaming” over President Donald Trump’s presidency. [Wintour, who showered Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election with donations, fundraisers and Vogue spreads, told the Business of Fashion (BOF) that while dissenters of the Trump administration should push back, the outrage over his presidency is useless.  “The country voted,” Wintour said. “So what can we do now to be most helpful and to also stand up for what we believe in?” While Wintour remains opposed to the Trump administration, saying “Dissent is not enough,” she also praised longtime fashion colleague Ivanka Trump, who has been invited by Wintour to attend the annual Costume Institute’s Met Gala, known as the ‘Oscars’ of the fashion industry. “Ivanka has had a long history with the magazine, and I have respect for Ivanka and everything that she has achieved,” Wintour told BOF. Wintour also left the door open to putting First Lady Melania Trump on the cover of American Vogue. “It doesn’t mean that we are necessarily agreeing with everything that they say, but a lot of the country does,” Wintour said as she explained that a Trump Vogue cover may be coming. “We always photograph or cover in some way the first ladies, so I can’t imagine that we wouldn’t at some point cover the first lady,” Wintour said. The First Lady is no stranger to sweeping magazine covers. In 2005, Melania Trump posed for the cover of American Vogue in her reportedly $1 million custom John Galliano for Christian Dior wedding gown. It is no surprise, however, that the fashion industry would be opposed to Trump’s ‘America First’ agenda. As Breitbart Texas previously reported, the New York fashion establishment greatly benefits from the outsourcing of American jobs and the   foreign guest worker visa, which displaces American workers from their jobs and hires foreign workers instead."
15597,34333,Why There Is No Reason to Believe Facebook’s Promise Not to Influence Voters Against Trump - Breitbart,Breitbart,Allum Bokhari,2016-04-16,2016.0,4.0,,"Gizmodo has revealed what everyone knew already: that Facebook’s employees are biased against presidential contender Donald Trump. [In response, the social network has hurriedly insisted that it’s a “neutral” platform and won’t use its considerable power to influence the election. But who really believes them?  The Gizmodo leaks showed employees voting in an internal poll to decide what questions they should ask CEO Mark Zuckerberg at his weekly QA. One of the more popular options was a loaded question concerning Republican frontrunner Donald Trump: “What responsibility does Facebook have to prevent President Trump in 2017?” It’s exactly the sort of question that   tech hipsters in Silicon Valley would ask their CEO. Facebook has since insisted that they will not seek to influence the election. But I’m more than a little sceptical. First, let’s examine Facebook’s public statement on the controversy: Voting is a core value of democracy and we believe that supporting civic participation is an important contribution we can make to the community. We encourage any and all candidates, groups, and voters to use our platform to share their views on the election and debate the issues. We as a company are neutral  —   we have not and will not use our products in a way that attempts to influence how people vote. The first thing to note about this statement is that it’s technically an impossible commitment for Facebook to make. The company has long switched from   newsfeeds (where ordinary people choose what information they come into contact with) to an algorithmic model, in which Facebook controls what content gets pushed to its users (and when). If Facebook’s algorithms think a news story is interesting to you, they’ll make sure you see it. By definition, a service that influences what information you see also influences how you vote. But let’s give Facebook the benefit of the doubt, and assume that their spokesman was merely trying to explain that the social network’s algorithms don’t privilege some presidential candidates above others. Even then, it’s still hard to believe. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has spent the last few months taking a string of outlandishly progressive poisitions (even by Silicon Valley standards) that are the polar opposite of Donald Trump’s. He’s effectively banned employees from criticising Black Lives Matter. He’s praised Germany’s immigration policies, urging the U. S. to “follow their lead. ” And, of course, he’s criticised Donald Trump’s policies directly, warning against “fearful voices calling for building walls. ” Zuckerberg has also approved political censorship on Facebook. After he personally assured German Chancellor Angela Merkel that he would crack down on   sentiment on the platform, Facebook launched a     campaign against “  hate speech. ” Zuckerberg and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg have since made regular trips to Germany. In other words, Facebook are already intervening in European politics. Why should we believe they won’t do the same in the U. S. election, particularly when Donald Trump threatens Silicon Valley’s   H1B migrant visas? It’s not as if Facebook would be the first. As Breitbart Tech revealed in February, Twitter deliberately manipulates its algorithm to favour a trusted “whitelist” of news sources, while pushing sources on a disfavoured “blacklist” down users’ search results. It’s hard to imagine that Facebook, whose CEO’s rabid progressivism easily matches that of Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, won’t one day go down the same route. After all, as UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh reminded Gizmodo, there are no legal obstacles in Zuckerberg’s way. He could, if he wished, be as biased as he liked in his management of Facebook. “Facebook has the same First Amendment right as the New York Times,” said Volokh. “They can completely block Trump if they want. They block him or promote him. ” Of course, taking an explicitly political stance might lose Facebook users. But then again, the political stances of the major newspapers also shut out readers of some political stripes while attracting others. Moreover, sites like Twitter and Reddit have proven that political bias can be introduced slowly, covertly, so that the majority of users don’t know what’s happening. (Indeed, we still don’t know the full details of how Twitter judges what news appears in front of its users, and when.) With no legal barriers to stop them, it seems inevitable that social media barons like Zuckerberg will eventually seek to emulate the old media barons, who imposed their own political values on the outlets that they owned. Just as unbiased news reporting is now a thing of the past, perhaps one day soon we shall remember unbiased social networks as nothing more than a memory: a utopian dream that could never have lasted. Of course, one chilling fact ought to be remembered: social media barons are vastly more powerful than their predecessors in the old media. They don’t just preside over the news and commentary of a few writers: they preside over the    conversations of billions of people around the world. They are the conduit for our thoughts, opinions, emotions, and in many cases, our everyday lives. They are, as we’ve previously pointed out at Breitbart Tech, the new plutocrats. And, given their political stances, this should make conservatives and libertarians very concerned indeed.

16224,34961,UK Equalities Chief Who Popularised The Term ’Islamophobia’ Admits: ’I Thought Muslims Would Blend into Britain... I Should Have Known Better’,Breitbart,Raheem Kassam,2016-04-10,2016.0,4.0,,"The former head of Britain’s Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) Trevor Phillips, has admitted he “got almost everything wrong” on Muslim immigration in a damning new report on integration, segregation, and how the followers of Islam are creating “nations within nations” in the West. [Phillips, a former elected member of the Labour Party who served as the Chairman of the EHRC from   will present “What British Muslims Really Think” on Channel 4 on Wednesday. An ICM poll released to the Times ahead of the broadcast reveals:   Writing in the Times on the issue, Phillips admits: “Liberal opinion in Britain has, for more than two decades, maintained that most Muslims are just like everyone else  …     Britain desperately wants to think of its Muslims as versions of the Great British Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain, or the   athlete Mo Farah. But thanks to the most detailed and comprehensive survey of British Muslim opinion yet conducted, we now know that just isn’t how it is. ” Phillips commissioned “the Runnymede report” into Britain and Islamophobia in 1997 which, according to both Phillips himself and academics across the country, popularised the phrase which has now become synonymous with any criticism  —   legitimate or not  —   of Islam or Muslims. Durham University’s Anthropology Journal noted in 2007: “It has been a decade since the Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia was established, a Commission that through its 1997 report, “Islamophobia: a challenge for us all” (“the Runnymede report”) not only raised an awareness of the growing reality of   and   hostility in Britain, but also marked the onset of what might be described as ‘the first decade of Islamophobia’. In doing so, the Runnymede report propelled the word ‘Islamophobia’ into the everyday common parlance and discourses of both the public and political spaces. ” Phillips says his new data shows “a chasm” opening between Muslims and   on fundamental issues such as marriage, relations between men and women, schooling, freedom of expression and even the validity of violence in defence of religion. He notes  —   echoing an article on Breitbart London just two weeks ago which reveals a growing disparity between older and younger Muslims in Britain  —   that “the gaps between Muslim and   youngsters are nearly as large as those between their elders”. And while he is cautious to note that many Muslims in Britain are grateful to be here, and do identify with role models such as Hussain and Farah, there is a widening gap in society with many Muslims segregating themselves. “It’s not as though we couldn’t have seen this coming. But we’ve repeatedly failed to spot the warning signs,” he admits. “Twenty years ago  …     I published the report titled Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All, we thought that the real risk of the arrival of new communities was discrimination against Muslims. Our 1996 survey of recent incidents showed that there was plenty of it around. But we got almost everything else wrong. ” His comments will come as a blow to those who continue to attack elements in British society who are concerned about Muslim immigration and integration, and in fact may even go some way to shoring up comments made by U. S. Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz seeking to slow down or pause the rate of Muslim immigration into the West. “We estimated that the Muslim population of the UK would be approaching 2 [million] by 2020. We underestimated by nearly a million. We predicted that the most lethal threat to Muslims would come from racial attacks and social exclusion. We completely failed to foresee the urban conflicts of 2001 that ravaged our northern cities. And of course we didn’t dream of   and the atrocities in Madrid, Paris, Istanbul, Brussels and London. ” “For a long time, I too thought that Europe’s Muslims would become like previous waves of migrants, gradually abandoning their ancestral ways, wearing their religious and cultural baggage lightly, and gradually blending into Britain’s diverse identity landscape. I should have known better. ” And Mr. Phillips even acknowledges that the mass sexual grooming and rape scandals that are plaguing heavily Muslim populated towns across Britain are because of Muslim  —   not ‘Asian’  —   men. He writes: “The contempt for white girls among some Muslim men has been highlighted by the recent scandals in Rotherham, Oxford, Rochdale and other towns. But this merely reflects a deeply ingrained sexism that runs through Britain’s Muslim communities”  —   in a nod to those who have long protested this to be the case in the face of political, media, and even police cover ups. Even left wing columnist Yasmin   told him: “[W]e [liberal Muslims] are a dying breed  —   in 10 years there will be very few of us left unless something really important is done. ” Phillips comments: “Some of my journalist friends imagine that, with time, the Muslims will grow out of it. They won’t. ” And indeed he lays the blame at the feet of the liberal, metropolitan elite, media classes: “Oddly, the biggest obstacles we now face in addressing the growth of this     are not created by British Muslims themselves. Many of our (distinctly  ) elite political and media classes simply refuse to acknowledge the truth. Any undesirable behaviours are attributed to poverty and alienation. Backing for violent extremism must be the fault of the Americans. Oppression of women is a cultural trait that will fade with time, nothing to do with the true face of Islam. ” “Even when confronted with the growing pile of evidence to the contrary, and the angst of the liberal minority of British Muslims, clever, important people still cling to the patronising certainty that British Muslims will, over time, come to see that “our” ways are better. ” In terms of solutions, Mr. Phillips opines on “halting the growth of sharia courts and placing them under regulation” ensuring that school governance never falls into the hands of a   group, “ensuring mosques that receive a steady flow of funds from foreign governments such as Saudi Arabia, however disguised, are forced to reduce their dependency on Wahhabi patronage” and an end to the “   understanding between local politicians and Muslim leaders  —   the sort of Pontius Pilate deal that had such catastrophic outcomes in Rotherham and Rochdale”. Mr. Phillips’s comments echo those of the Czech president, and research from across Europe that revealed attitudes amongst Muslims on the continent have hardened. The younger the Muslim, the more likely they are to hold   views, one recent study found.

16566,35303,Huma Abedin Wanted Shorter Statement for Podium-Less Hillary,Breitbart,Ezra Dulis,2016-10-16,2016.0,10.0,,"Huma Abedin, top aide to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, asked a speechwriter to shorten a potential statement to reporters because Clinton would not deliver it at a podium, according to the latest Wikileaks release of messages from John Podesta’s email accounts. [Dan Schwerin, Direct of Speechwriting for Clinton’s campaign, sent a draft of a “  statement [Hillary] could make to press” after she testified before the House Benghazi Committee in October 2015. The statement, at 253 words, would take the average speaker less than two minutes to deliver.  “I would make it shorter only because it’s a bank of Mics and no podium,” Abedin replied. Based on contemporaneous news reports, Clinton’s team appears to have scrapped a “ ” statement altogether  —   since Clinton ultimately sat and talked for 11 hours over the course of the hearing. During that time, Clinton suffered a coughing fit for several minutes while answering questions from Rep. Elijah Cummings.  Schwerin’s email is time stamped 5:48 PM on the day that Clinton testified. While the time zone is not specified, Clinton’s hearing adjourned around 9:00 PM eastern Schwerin’s message, at the earliest, would have come near the end of its seventh hour. Abedin responded at 7:49 PM. In a   interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow the next day, Clinton said that after the hearing, “I had my whole team come over to my house and we sat around eating Indian food and drinking wine and beer” and talked about TV shows. Clinton appeared to deliver a condensed version of Schwerin’s draft to an early question in the Maddow interview: I said I would do it and I did it because if there is anything new, which is unlikely after the eight prior investigations that have been held, we should know about it because the point is, what are we going to do to both honor the people that we lost and try to make sure this doesn’t happen again?  And as I said yesterday, we have had horrific incidents.  We lost so many Americans in Beirut for a bombing of our embassy, then a bombing of the Marine barracks.  We lost so many Americans in Beirut, first a bombing of our embassy, then a bombing of the Marine barracks.  We lost Americans in the   bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.  We had more than a hundred attacks on our facilities around the world since 2001. So we live in a complicated, dangerous world.  And so we do want to have a, a good conversation where people come to the table ready to actually learn about what we can do.  I’m afraid that’s, you know, not necessarily what this particular committee is doing, but we have learned a lot from our previous investigations, and I’m certainly, you know, committed to doing all I can to make sure we do save lives. Clinton’s Republican rival Donald Trump has questioned whether she possesses enough “stamina” to perform her duties as president. This week, Trump’s campaign released an attack ad with footage of Clinton’s security detail dragging her into a van during a medical episode she experienced on September 11th, 2016.  A statement from Clinton’s physician Lisa Bardack said that the candidate had been diagnosed with pneumonia several days before the incident."
16843,35580,Zakaria: Rise of Islamic Extremism ’a Similar Dynamic’ to the Rise of Trump in the GOP - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jeff Poor,2016-03-07,2016.0,3.0,,"Sunday on his CNN show “Fareed Zakaria GPS,” Fareed Zakaria likened Republican presidential   Donald Trump’s rise to that of extremism in Islam.  According to Zakaria, elements in Islam have not denounced extremism in the same way that Republicans within the conservative world have not sufficiently denounced Trump. Transcript as follows: A main cause of the rise of extremism in the world of Islam has been the cowardice of Muslim moderates who for decades chose not to condemn bad ideas and ugly rhetoric. Fearing that they’d be seen simply as ideological weaklings, they avoided confronting the cancer in plain sight. It is now clear that a similar dynamic has been at play in the world of conservatism. Mitt Romney should be congratulated for making a speech calling Donald Trump a phony and a fraud. But where was he when, in 2012, casting Trump was pushing his nasty and utterly false campaign casting doubt on President Obama’s American citizenship? By Trump’s side in Las Vegas, as E. J. Dionne reminds us in his book, “Why the Right Went Wrong. ” (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MITT ROMNEY, FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There are some things that you just can’t imagine happening in your life. Having his endorsement is a delight. I’m so honored and pleased to have his endorsement. (END VIDEO CLIP) ZAKARIA: And while he generally issued birtherism, Romney fed the fires later that year by joking, no one’s ever asked to see my birth certificate. There have always been radicals on both sides of the political spectrum, but what is different about the conservative movement is that since the 1990s, some of its most distinguished mainstream members have embraced the rhetoric and tactics of the extremes. A memo put out by Newt Gingrich’s political action committee that decade urged Republican candidates to use savage rhetoric against their Democratic opponents. Some of the recommended words were failure, pathetic, disgrace, and incompetent. In the last month, Donald Trump has called Mitt Romney a failed candidate, Jeb Bush, pathetic, Lindsey Graham, a disgrace, and President Obama, totally incompetent. Perhaps he read the memo. It is courageous of dozens of Republican foreign policies leaders now to sign an open letter condemning Trump publicly and refusing his candidacy. But over the last decade I can recall conservatives with many of these individuals in which they refused to accept that there was any problem within the Republican Party, attributing such criticism to media bias. We still see this denial by some commentators with their truly bizarre claims of the rise of Trump is really all the fault of President Obama. The logic varies. For some it is because he has been so weak. The “Wall Street Journal” editorial page opined, “The oldest truism in politics is that demagogues flourish in the absence of leadership. ” I must confess to never having heard that truism and wondered how it would explain the rise of Father Coughlin and Huey Long during Franklin Roosevelt’s reign, or Joseph McCarthy under Dwight Eisenhower. For others, however, it’s Obama has been too strong, abusing executive power and elevating himself to center celebrity stage. Apparently having Oprah share the stage with you leads to authoritarian populism. Here’s a much simpler explanation for Donald Trump. Republicans have fed the country ideas about decline, betrayal, and treason. They have encouraged the forces of   obstructionism and populism. They have flirted with bigotry and racism. Trump merely chose to unashamedly embrace all of it, saying plainly what they were hinting at for years. In doing so, he hit the jackpot. The problem is not that Republican leaders should have begun to condemn Trump last year. It is that they should have condemned the ideas and tactics that led to his rise when they began to flourish in the last century. (  Mediaite) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"

[More than a million people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere arrived in Germany last year. The mood towards them has soured after a spate of attacks on civilians last month, including three carried out by migrants.  Two of those attacks were claimed by the Islamic State militant group. “The phenomenon of Islamist terrorism, of IS, is not a phenomenon that came to us with the refugees,” Merkel said at an election campaign event for her Christian Democrats in the eastern state of   ahead of a regional vote on Sept. 4. Merkel: refugees not to blame for terrorismAngela Merkel says it’s wrong to blame refugees and migrants for terrorism in Germany following recent attacks in the country. Posted by Channel 4 News on Thursday, 18 August 2016, Merkel said many people had travelled from Germany to Syria for training with Islamist militants. In June Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said a total of more than 800 were believed to have gone to Syria and Iraq. “This group has worried us for several years,” she said at the event in Neustrelitz, a town 100 km (60 miles) north of Berlin. Merkel’s popularity has suffered in the wake of the attacks and 52 percent of Germans think her migrant policy is bad, a poll published last week showed. The influx of migrants, many of whom are Muslim, has boosted support for the   Alternative for Germany (AfD) which is expected to perform well in elections in   and Berlin. “We have said clearly that an Islam that works and lives on the basis of the constitution   …     belongs to Germany,” Merkel said. She added that a type of Islam that did not stick to the constitution or accept equal rights for women had no place in the country."

[The technology, which is just a proof of concept, is being designed to equip first responders with the necessary information to promptly respond to crimes. “It’s a way to help people take advantage of information that’s out there,” says David Ebert, an electrical and computer engineer at Purdue University.  While some are optimistic about the implementation of the technology to prevent crime, others are concerned that it is likely to be abused.  “I can certainly see the utility for first responders,” says Dave Maass, an investigative researcher with digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). “But it does open up the potential for some unseemly surveillance. ” The system is being developed at Purdue University, where computer scientists are determining how the technology can be used without abuse. Currently, Purdue limits access to only registered users and requires them to “agree not to use the platform to determine the identity of any specific individuals contained in any video or video stream. ” Voices across the technology world have spoken up to express their skepticism towards the Purdue’s surveillance system. Gautam Hans, a member of the Center for Democracy  Technology expressed concern that it would be disastrous if the technology could fell into the wrong hands.  “I think it becomes a very tempting target,” says Hans. “Thinking about security issues is going to be a major concern. ” Despite his concerns, Hans suggested the technological evolution is inevitable, and that efforts to protect privacy will be best focused on the management of future technologies rather than the prevention of their development. “At a certain level there’s only so much you can do to prevent the march of technology,” he says. “It’s not the best use of our time to rail against its existence.

The evidence easily indicates more than $10, 000 of   contributions to Bernie 2016 in New Hampshire alone, and hints that similar financial outlays were made by ALP in several other state primaries. By all reasonable accounts and calculations, Bernie 2016 is responsible for accepting —  or at least receiving —  tens of thousands of dollars in foreign   contributions. And the ALP is responsible for prohibited intervention in a federal election. The discovery that workers with the ALP were financed by their own socialist democratic party to work on Bernie’s 2016 presidential campaign was made by the Project Veritas Action Fund. Last month, several recordings of conversations with Sanders campaigners were exposed in a report from the Project Veritas Action Fund that featured these Australian nationals. At that time, three quarters of them were employed with the ALP. They’re quoted saying they’ve been stealing political yard signs and had replaced Hillary Clinton campaign literature with Sanders literature. These foreign “volunteers” were deployed to Nevada, New York, New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina and another state to carry out illicit acts on behalf of the Sanders campaign and were paid by their own party to do this. “Voters in New Hampshire and, indeed, the nation require that their right to choose a president not be sold to foreign bidders,” the complaint notes. FECA states that “a foreign national, directly or indirectly” cannot lawfully “make a contribution or donation of money or or thing or value  …     in connection with a Federal, State or local election. ” It also states that it is unlawful for “a person to solicit, accept or receive a contribution or donation  …     from a foreign national. ” The money that was expended by the ALP for travel, housing and food to and in New Hampshire for the purpose of “volunteering” for Bernie 2016 are all prohibited contributions under FECA. Sanders has consistently made the rallying cry against the corruption inherent in the Democratic Establishment and the Clinton and Obama camps the guise of his “political revolution. ” It turns out, he is not so different from the politicians he criticizes. In a press release he issued on filing a complaint with the FEC against the ALP and the Bernie 2016 presidential campaign, O’Brien writes “There is a long tradition in the Democrat Party of trading away American sovereignty for campaign contributions. ”  O’Brien noted that findings by the Project Veritas Action Fund show that Bernie 2016 has now introduced “a new wrinkle to this now   Democrat practice of foreign support of their presidential campaigns. ” He notes that “under Bill Clinton, intelligence information showed that the Chinese mainland government funneled illegal contributions to the Democratic National Committee. ” And that President Barack Obama, who was at the time a junior Illinois senator seeking the nation’s highest office, “had turned repeatedly to the world outside the United States for contributions to his presidential campaign. ” The findings came shortly after Obama had delivered a controversial 2008 speech in Berlin, Germany in which he described himself as a “citizen of the world. ” His foreign policy has arguably proven to be a reflection of that   priority.  The Sanders campaign has not yet responded to Breitbart News inquiries about this matter. Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz."

[“I support Trump. I’m gonna vote for Trump,” Giuliani stated, The New York Post reported on Thursday.  Giuliani predicted Trump should get more than 50 percent of the vote in the New York GOP primary. “It’s a question of how much he gets over 50 percent. If he wins 70 to 80 delegates, Donald has a good shot of securing the 1, 237 delegates to secure the nomination before the convention,” Giuliani explained of the 95 New York delegates up for grabs. “It’s New York City. We’re family. I can make fun of New York. But you can’t!” Giuliani said of Sen. Ted Cruz’s New York values jab. “I know he was attacking liberal Democratic values   …     I know.

30076,48841,"It’s the Supreme Court, Stupid! - Breitbart",Breitbart,Tom Tancredo,2016-08-27,2016.0,8.0,,"In the early days of Bill Clinton’s campaign to oust President George Herbert Walker Bush from the White House in 1992, his campaign strategists concocted a slogan that defined Bush as a failure and set the guardrails for the Democrats’ entire campaign: “It’s the economy, stupid. ”[It stuck, and as they say, the rest is history.  Let’s cut to the chase. Donald Trump is changing his position on illegal immigration. I, Tom Tancredo, the man who has championed border controls and immigration enforcement more than any other national figure, say: no big deal. It’s the Supreme Court, stupid! I do care whether Donald Trump changes his position or “refines” his position, on deportation of millions of illegal aliens. But what I care about most  —   and what all patriots and constitutionalists should tattoo on their eyelids  —   is that Donald Trump, not Hillary Clinton, must make the next Supreme Court appointments. Yes, I know: There is no way to guarantee that Donald Trump will make the same appointments to the Supreme Court that Ted Cruz or Tom Tancredo would make. Republican President Richard Nixon gave us the author of the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, and George H. W. Bush gave us David Souter. But what is guaranteed is that Trump’s appointments to federal courts will be 1, 000 percent better than Hillary Clinton’s. (Can you spell Associate Justice            ?) Constitutional conservatives understand that our immigration laws are meaningless if they are not enforced. It will mean nothing if President Trump orders a wall built from Brownsville to San Diego if a lawsuit brought by a dozen leftist groups results in a U. S. Supreme Court decision striking down that order as contrary to the Constitution. The same is true for every single important issue you can name, from education choice to refugee admissions, from criminal justice reform to repeal of Obamacare. If Hillary Clinton is allowed to remake the entire Supreme Court for a generation in the image of Justices Ginsberg and Sotomayor, our Constitution is dead and salt poured on the gravesite. What is most important  —   and most important by a factor of one hundred  —   is that the Scalia vacancy and every other vacancy that occurs be filled by a judge who respects the Constitution as a restraint on Congress and the President, not a blank slate for creating a socialist utopia of “transformative justice. ” Yes, immigration policy is one of the two most important challenges that will confront the president sworn in on January 20, 2017. The other is Islamist terrorism. I hope Donald Trump spells out ambitious, sensible and effective plans for meeting those two challenges. Yet, frankly, I do not care much about the changing details or the numbers in his call for deportations, or how high or how long the wall will be, or how many thousand refugees from Muslim countries will be allowed admission instead of the 100, 000 yearly Hillary will allow. Those details and those numbers will all be subject to negotiation with Congress, including Republican leaders who are not friendly to robust immigration enforcement. What I care about very much and what I know for a 100 percent certainty is that those decisions and proposals by President Donald Trump will be one thousand percent more consistent with my constitutional principles than the decisions made by President Hillary Clinton. What is not in the spotlight of media coverage of the campaign is this truth: Even if Trump and Congress deadlock on new immigration policies, all President Trump has to do to change direction radically is to order the robust enforcement of our current immigration laws. Bingo! So, if candidate Trump needs to trim his sales on immigration law enforcement in order to get to 270 Electoral College votes on November 8, that will not give me heartburn. Half a loaf from Trump is better than a handful of stale crumbs from Hillary Clinton and the National Council of La Raza. Why am I so accommodating to a less “ ” immigration platform? The answer is as simple as it is obvious: After eight years of Obama’s government by executive decree, not only in immigration but across a broad spectrum of government programs, our Constitution is in tatters. If we invite four more years of this lawlessness with a Supreme Court clearing the way for every new insult to American sovereignty and the rule of law, there will be no possibility of returning to the constitutional government we inherited from ten generations of patriots. We do not need a host of new immigration laws, and if fact, we not need a   wall on the southwest border. What we need most is the conscientious enforcement of existing immigration laws that have been subverted and castrated by Obama. After a housecleaning and restaffing the upper echelons of the Department of Homeland Security, a simple order from President Trump to the 25, 000 officers of the US Border Patrol would be sufficient to halt 95 percent of the illegal traffic across our border. That order would be only ten words: Do your job, and call me if you need anything. The really good news is that such simple policies  —   the actual enforcement of existing immigration laws  —   do not require new legislation. They do not require cutting a deal with Senator Chuck Schumer or the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. What the enforcement of immigration laws does require is a Supreme Court that respects the Constitution and the President’s oath to take care that laws be faithfully executed. If Clinton’s Supreme Court reverses the Fifth U. S. Circuit Court ruling that invalidated Obama’s “executive amnesty,” then new immigration laws will be meaningless because they will mean whatever President Hillary Clinton wants them to mean. In 2016, we have come to a day or reckoning in American politics. Patriots must take sides, and also must take up arms. In politics, our arms are our votes. Those votes will not be cast for mythical perfect candidates, for better candidates that should have won or might have won, but didn’t. We have to vote for one of two candidates who have a chance to take that oath of office on a cold day in January. For myself, when I cast my ballot, I will not be asking whether Donald Trump’s immigration policies are 100 percent in tune with my own. It is enough that whatever policies he finally adopts, my country has a 1, 000 percent better chance of survival than if Hillary Clinton is making Supreme Court appointments designed to complete Obama’s dream of remaking America into something the patriots who died in battle at Bunker Hill, Omaha Beach and Fallujah would not recognize."
30471,49236,Students Ask Professors to Stop Quoting Thomas Jefferson at University He Founded - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tom Ciccotta,2016-11-15,2016.0,11.0,,"Students at the University of Virginia, which was founded by Thomas Jefferson, are asking administrators to pass a resolution that would prevent faculty from quoting the third president of the United States. [Students at the University of Virginia drafted a letter in response to the use of a Jefferson quote in a recent community email sent by University President Teresa Sullivan.  In the email, Sullivan referenced a remark Jefferson made to a friend in a letter, in which he wrote that University of Virginia students would become influential leaders in American society. “Thomas Jefferson wrote to a friend that University of Virginia students ‘are not of ordinary significance only: they are exactly the persons who are to succeed to the government of our country, and to rule its future enmities, its friendships and fortunes,’” Sullivan said in the email. “I encourage today’s U. Va. students to embrace that responsibility. ” Many in the University of Virginia community rejected the use of Jefferson’s writing in the email, arguing that he should be left out of university procedures all together because of the fact that he owned slaves. The letter argued that quoting Jefferson undermines the school’s value of unity, equality and civility: “We would like for our administration to understand that although some members of this community may have come to this university because of Thomas Jefferson’s legacy, others of us came here in spite of it,” the letter read. “For many of us, the inclusion of Jefferson quotations in these   undermines the message of unity, equality and civility that you are attempting to convey. ” “I think that Jefferson is often celebrated for his accomplishments with little or no acknowledgement of the atrocities he committed against hundreds of human beings,” said assistant psychology professor Noelle Hurd, who helped to draft the letter. University of Virginia Politics professor Lawrie Balfour felt that the use of Jefferson’s quote was insensitive, especially given Donald Trump’s victory in last week’s presidential election. “Again and again, I have found that at moments when the community needs reassurance and Jefferson appears, it undoes I think the really important work the administrators and others are trying to do,” Balfour said.

30969,49734,Teacher Suspended for Comparing Trump to Hitler - Breitbart,Breitbart,Adelle Nazarian,2016-11-15,2016.0,11.0,,"A high school teacher in California was placed on paid leave after comparing   Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler, the man responsible for the slaughter of 6 million Jewish people. [The teacher has been allowed to return to work after a brief suspension.  According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Mountain View High School history teacher Frank Navarro, who is described as a Holocaust scholar, reportedly made the comparison “in an effort to show students that the 2016 election is a reflection of the past. ” Or, as others might suggest, Navarro had made the comparison in an attempt to show that “history repeats itself. ” A parent reportedly complained about the parallels Navarro drew, which resulted in the school’s principal and district superintendent asking him to leave on Thursday in what they described as a “time out” as they investigated the incident. Speaking to the San Francisco Chronicle on Saturday, the   veteran of the school said, “this parent said that I had said Donald Trump was Hitler. That’s sloppy historical thinking,” he said. Yet, Navarro later went on to draw a comparison between Adolf Hitler’s campaign promise to eject foreigners and make Germany “great again” with Trump’s rhetoric about building a wall to keep out illegal immigrants in order to “Make America Great Again. ” Navarro reportedly said, “I think it makes sense. It’s factual, it’s  . It reminds students that history is real. ” The Chronicle notes that Principal David Grissom and Superintendent Jeff Harding made the decision to place Navarro on temporarily leave, fearing the lesson may have been inappropriate . However, a Mountain View High alumnus reportedly started a Change. org petition two days later demanding Navarro’s leave be revoked and asking the principal to apologize “for attempting to intimidate a respected educator. ” The petition had garnered over 17, 000 signatures as of Sunday evening. On the petition, alumna Annie Ashmore quoted Mr. Navarro bashing Trump, saying, “In Mr. Navarro’s words, “I feel strongly about this: to stand quiet in the face of bigotry and to turn your eyes away from it is to back up the bigotry, and that’s not what I, or any history teacher, should be doing in our work. ” Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz"
31621,50387,California earthquake swarm rocks New Year’s Eve,CNN,,2017-01-01,2017.0,1.0,," (CNN) Dozens of earthquakes helped bring in the New Year around Brawley, California, but they are more of a curiosity than a concern, experts tell CNN. Caltech seismologist Lucy Jones said earthquake ”swarms” aren’t unexpected around Brawley    there also was a swarm in 2012    because the   region called the Brawley Seismic Zone lies between the large San Andreas Fault and the Imperial Fault. More than 100 earthquakes have hit the region this weekend, but most are too weak, under 2. 5 magnitude, to be noticed by people, said Donyelle Davis, spokeswoman for the United States Geological Survey.  Weak quakes can trigger a bigger, more dangerous quake, but Brawley, a city of about 25, 000 people near the Mexican border, is too far from the San Andreas Fault for that to be much of a risk, Davis said. ”This area may have produced the most earthquakes in the entire state of California, but they are small,” Jones said. ”If they happened a mile away  we would be concerned, but these quakes are about 30 miles from the San Andreas Fault.” Since Saturday at least 24 quakes have been 2. 5 to 3. 9 magnitude, according to the Geological Survey. Earthquakes of 3. 9 magnitude or less generally create little or no damage.  They are common in California. As of noon Sunday, the state had had 191 earthquakes in the past 24 hours and 7, 707 in the past 365 days, with the largest measuring 6. 5 in Ferndale, according to the website earthquaketracker. com.  Catastrophic earthquakes seem to strike along the southern San Andreas Fault about once every 150 years, the  Geological Survey said, citing studies examining the past 1, 400 years. The last time an enormous temblor on the fault struck Southern California was in 1857."
32312,51079,Lewinsky cites Barron Trump incident to denounce cyberbullying,CNN,,2017-01-24,2017.0,1.0,,"Washington (CNN) Monica Lewinsky is citing the recent cyberbullying of Barron Trump to rail against online harassment. The former White House intern, who is now an   activist, took to Twitter Monday to defend the youngest child of President Donald Trump after several social media users    particularly ”Saturday Night Live” writer Katie Rich    mocked the boy online. ”All children need to be protected from bullying + mockery. (incl. Barron Trump),” Lewinsky tweeted. ”Let’s be better than this.”  Rich’s tweet, which was sent out during President Trump’s inauguration, was widely criticized on social media. Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton also weighed in, tweeting, ”Barron Trump deserves the chance every child   be a kid.”  Rich ultimately deleted the tweet as well as her Twitter account, which she then reactivated on Monday in order to post an apology. She has since been suspended indefinitely from the show for her tweet, a person familiar with the situation told CNN Money. Lewinsky also came to Rich’s defense on Tuesday after the SNL scribe was herself the target of online harassment. ”Online mobs are not the answer either. @katiemaryrich has apologized. comedy is an imperfect science. (trust me! ),” Lewinsky wrote. Amid the tweeting controversy surrounding Barron Trump, the White House issued a statement on Tuesday reiterating its unwritten rule that presidential children are off limits, though it did not cite a particular incident or mention any of Trump’s children by name. ”It is a longstanding tradition that the children of Presidents are afforded the opportunity to grow up outside of the political spotlight. The White House fully expects this tradition to continue. We appreciate your cooperation in this matter,” the statement said.  When a Twitter user mentioned to Lewinsky that Malia and Sasha Obama were the targets of racist comments during their tenure at the White House, the former White House intern tweeted that was ”not ok either.” Lewinsky has used her fame after the Clinton years to advocate for a safer social media environment. She spoke out against online harassment and public shaming during a TED Talks speech in March 2015 and has since launched a line of   emojis and GIFs. "
34618,53436,"United in grief, Facebook killer’s ex-girlfriend meets victim’s family",CNN,Faith Karimi,2017-04-19,2017.0,4.0,," (CNN) The three women hugged, prayed and talked, united in grief by a killer who recorded the last minutes of his victim’s life.  Nearly 48 hours after the shooting death of Robert Godwin Sr. 74, on Easter Sunday, two of his daughters and the killer’s   met for the first time.  Godwin was walking down a street in Cleveland, Ohio, when Steve Stephens gunned him down, then posted a video of the killing on Facebook.  Before the shooting, he demanded Godwin say Joy Lane, the name of Stephens’  . ”She’s the reason that this is about to happen to you,” Stephens told Godwin in the video. He then shot him, forever linking Lane and the victim’s family.   Lane and two of the victim’s daughters, Debbie Godwin and Tonya   met Tuesday, CNN affiliate WJW reported. There was no fingerpointing    just hugs. No accusations    just mutual grief.  ’The hashtags Joy Lane’ During the meeting, the three women shared their pain, the affiliate reported, each affected differently by a killing that stunned the nation.  Stephens fled after he killed Godwin, triggering a manhunt that extended to several states and ended when he shot himself on Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Lane said it has been difficult watching her name dominate social media, where her connection to the killer became a topic of discussion over the weekend.  ”The hashtags Joy Lane, Joy Lane massacre    I don’t even know who Joy Lane is anymore, or how to pick up all the pieces of my world at this moment,” Lane told the affiliate.  ”I’ve got a lot of negative comments. Some even said he should have killed me.” Lane said she’s devastated that the victim said her name before he was shot.  ”I feel bad . .. The last thing that he would have said was my name and didn’t know me or why he was saying it. And that’s been difficult,” she said.  Lane said she and Stephens dated for a while, and had discussed getting engaged, but they broke up and she urged him to seek help for gambling issues.  They last talked Saturday night, she told the affiliate, when Stephens told her he’d quit his job and was moving out of state.  She told the affiliate that she tried to reach Stephens after the video of the killing surfaced on Facebook, but he didn’t answer his phone.  Godwin taught forgiveness  The sisters told Lane the killing is not her fault, and they don’t hold any ill will toward her. In an interview with CNN, several of Godwin’s children said they held no animosity toward Stephens, either. ”Each one of us forgives the killer, the murderer,”   said Monday.  Godwin taught his children the value of hard work, how to love God and how to forgive, his children said.  ”They don’t make men like him anymore,” Debbie Godwin said. ”He was definitely one in a million.” Manhunt ends, After the fatal shooting of the   mechanic and grandfather of 14, authorities nationwide scrambled for two days to find Stephens.  The   manhunt ended Tuesday after the killer stopped at a McDonald’s in Harborcreek Township, Pennsylvania, 100 miles from the scene of the killing.  His craving for fries and chicken McNuggets led him to the fast food restaurant, where an employee recognized him and called  police.   Stephens fled and Pennsylvania State Police troopers pursued, prompting an officer to ram the car to disable it. As his vehicle  was spinning out of control, Stephens pulled a pistol and shot himself in the head, according to police.  Authorities had hoped for a different outcome.  ”We’re grateful that this has ended,” Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said. ”We would prefer that it had not ended this way because there are a lot of questions, I’m sure, that not only the family, but the city in general would have had for Steve.” Godwin’s daughter, Brenda Haymon, learned of Stephens’ death as she was planning funeral arrangements for her father.  ”All I can say is that I wish he had gone down in a hail of 100 bullets,” Haymon said. ”I wish it had gone down like that instead of him shooting himself.” Godwin will be laid to rest Saturday, nearly a week after his last meal with his children."
36531,55358,Revelation of ISIS battle shows risks for troops,CNN,Barbara Starr,2016-06-20,2016.0,6.0,,"Washington (CNN) A previously unpublicized battle with ISIS so intense that it saw a U. S. service member awarded a Silver Star is highlighting the increasing danger U. S. troops are facing as they advise and assist forces in Syria and Iraq. CNN has learned that Navy SEAL Charles Keating IV participated in a major clash in Syria in March for which he posthumously received the nation’s   award for combat valor. CNN has also obtained new details about the fatal May 3 firefight in which Keating lost his life. Keating, tasked to fill a ”train, advise and assist” role, was killed in Iraq while helping to rescue a small team of U. S. military advisers and Kurdish forces from an attack mounted by more than 100 ISIS fighters. A decorated combat veteran and star athlete who decided to enlist after the   attacks, Keating was part of a Navy SEAL operation in northern Iraq called Task Force Trident working with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters combatting ISIS. According to one account of the May clash in Iraq provided to CNN, a group of Navy SEALs and local Peshmerga forces were attacked by a large unit of ISIS fighters that had overwhelmed the Kurdish front line by rushing in with bulldozers, trucks and weapons. RELATED: Charles Keating IV gave life rescuing others  A group of nearly 20 SEALs including Keating was deployed to respond to the ISIS attack. During the ongoing battle, the SEALs ran low on ammunition and Keating’s machine gun malfunctioned, according to initial battlefield reports. Keating went back to a nearby coalition vehicle to get a new weapon and additional ammunition. Keating, now armed with a sniper rifle, climbed on top of a building and began firing on the ISIS fighters. It was at this point that Keating was struck by enemy fire. Two other SEALs carried him down from the roof and he was placed in a medevac helicopter, but the battle was so intense that the helicopter was also hit before managing to take him to a hospital where he was declared dead. At the time, coalition spokesman Col. Steve Warren told reporters that that the   clash between ISIS and the Peshmerga forces the advisers were assisting was ”a big fight, one of the largest we’ve seen recently.” But a previously unrevealed battle on March 4 equally dire and dangerous, involving pitched combat against about 100 ISIS fighters.  The details of this earlier fight were revealed in the   Silver Star citation presented to Keating’s family after his death on May 3. According to the citation, Keating ”continuously exposed himself to enemy automatic weapon, mortar, and rocket grenade fire.” Keating kept moving on the battlefield between the front line and the flanks talking to the Peshmerga, encouraging them to keep going. In the March battle, more than 100 ISIS operatives assaulted Peshmerga lines and Keating, serving as an advisor then as in May, moved in to help repel the attack.  As ISIS fighters sent a car bomb towards him, Keating led a team to counterattack with sniper and rocket fire. ”His personal bravery inspired his comrades to vigorously defend their position and repel the enemy assault,” according to the citation. The Pentagon has never acknowledged the first Syrian battle. U. S. military officials say they are under no obligation to reveal the details of battles U. S. troops are involved in even if it’s against a large enemy force, and they will not routinely report if a U. S. service member is wounded    only when one is killed. The revelation of two pitched battles in the space of eight weeks between Navy SEALs and two groups each of 100 ISIS fighters underscores that Special Operations Forces being deployed to train, advise and assist local forces are in real danger of being attacked. In April President Barack Obama announced the deployment of 250 additional Special Operation Forces to Syria and described their role in a somewhat different way. While making the announcement in Hannover, Germany, Obama said, ”They’re not going to be leading the fight on the ground, but they will be essential in providing the training and assisting local forces.”"
36961,55791,Murphy: Trump shouldn’t get classified info,CNN,,2016-07-06,2016.0,7.0,,"Washington (CNN) Sen. Chris Murphy said Wednesday it was Donald Trump    not Hillary Clinton    who Americans should worry will divulge classified information.  Following House Republicans’ calls to bar Clinton from receiving classified information, Murphy defended the former secretary of state and cast doubt on Trump’s ability to keep state secrets during an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.  ”I’ve frankly raised questions as to whether he can hold onto this classified information or whether he’s going to stand up in front of one of these rallies and blurt out something that could put this country at risk,” Murphy told Blitzer on ”The Situation Room.” FBI director to testify before Congress about Clinton’s email investigation, Earlier Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan called for Clinton to be barred from receiving briefings on national security issues usually provided to major party presumptive nominees by the director of national intelligence.  Ryan cited FBI Director James Comey’s findings that Clinton was ”extremely careless” in handling classified information, telling reporters: ”I think it’s the least we can do, given how she was so reckless in handling classified material and sending classified information on insecure servers.” Murphy called Ryan’s comments ”frankly ridiculous, but to be expected.” The Connecticut Democrat, who led a   filibuster on gun control last month, described Trump as ”somebody who is pretty clearly putting his political future and his business future first” and ”his country second.” ”I certainly worry that he might do that with classified information as well,” Murphy added.  Although Murphy said he would leave it to intelligence officials to determine how much information to put in the briefings if they do decide to provide them them to both candidates, he suggested that officials ”at least maybe give him a little bit of elementary education into the importance of classified information.” Comey on Clinton email scandal: ’reasonable’ minds disagree? He also defended Clinton: ”The fact of the matter is that Hillary Clinton was a United States senator, was secretary of state, did an incredible amount of great work to keep this country safe during that time.”"
37225,56057,Mick Jagger a dad at 72? Why not?,CNN,Ford Vox,2016-07-15,2016.0,7.0,," (CNN) So Mick Jagger is about to become a father again. The singer has announced that child number eight    conceived with his    girlfriend Melanie Hamrick    is on the way.  Congratulations to Papa Stone    who has been a   since 2014. He’s now 72 years young and even though he is still able to rock the free world (and give free concerts in the    world, as he did in Havana show last March) there are good reasons the rest of the world’s   men should think twice about fathering children at that age.   We usually think about older parenting as an issue for women: It’s easy to understand why they would not want to have children as they get older. A   report last year calculated the risk of death during child delivery in the United States at 1 per 1, 800. The risk is highest for older mothers, and that’s partly why the female body at some point says, ”No more” (also known as menopause).  What’s more, children of older mothers are subject to higher risks for genetic diseases. In the case of Down syndrome, that risk approaches an astounding 3% as women reach age 45.   will offer genetic screening to women planning a pregnancy at 35 or older, or who have other risk factors. And the ease of blood tests has many women well below 35 also getting genetic workups before or during their pregnancies.  While Hamrick is only 29, her doctor probably offered some of this testing, if not for any risk factor of her own, because her partner, Mick, is 72.  So what are the issues for older fathers? The   paternal age effect is linked to numerous genetic disorders (including Down syndrome) as well as the complicated mixture of nature and nurture that lead to a variety of other psychiatric and neurological problems. Studies demonstrate that children of older fathers are more likely to have autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, and learning difficulties.  To take autism as an example, an Israeli study concluded that men over 40 were five times more likely to have children with autism versus men under 30.  Scientists are still theorizing about the precise genetic mechanisms at work here, but in general it’s well understood that our cells have more trouble dividing without error as they age, and that includes the sperm produced in a man’s testes. The cells in the testes that ultimately produce sperm, called spermatogonia, divide 23 times per year, with each division producing a new chance for error.

Beyond genetic risk factors, choosing to reproduce in your later years means you’re more likely to start suffering health setbacks as your child is reaching major milestones in his or her early life. Even if you’re as healthy as Mick Jagger, who’s planning a big show in Vegas this fall, this is an unavoidable consideration. There’s no question that the illness and death of a parent imprints in unpredictable ways on children and teenagers.  We’re all living longer and healthier, but the wealthy especially so. With access to more active and interesting lifestyles    bringing a wide range of mentally stimulating activities, as well as great diets, personal trainers, and easy access to the full range of the world’s best health care    the rich are living especially well these days.

37587,56425,Democrats review Clinton’s convention message ,CNN,MJ Lee,2016-07-29,2016.0,7.0,,"Philadelphia (CNN) Democrats who came to Philadelphia this week fretting about party division say there is only one way to ensure Hillary Clinton wins in November: defining themselves as the party of national unity.  Confronted by a Republican nominee they view as a demagogue, Democrats say with a growing sense of urgency that it is imperative for their party to embrace racial diversity, inclusion and bipartisanship as the key to defeating Donald Trump.  CNN interviewed more than a dozen Clinton supporters at the Democratic National Convention who hope to see the former secretary of state inherit the presidency from Barack Obama, asking what they perceived to be the core messages of Clinton and Trump. Many described a feeling of alarm and and even fear at the extreme differences between the two presidential nominees.  After a tumultuous few days in Philadelphia rocked by outbursts from Bernie Sanders supporters, many Democrats leave the convention confident that Clinton has found a positive theme of tolerance and championing minorities and the disenfranchised to counter Trump’s darker rhetoric.  ”Hillary Clinton’s message is that we are much better together. And that is true    we don’t need to make America great. We are great already,” said William Frick, a Clinton delegate from South Carolina. ”But we can be better when we work together.” Frick, a    attorney, described Trump’s message as: ”Make America hate again.” ”He wants to talk about a great time that existed in ’Leave It to Beaver’ and not in reality,” he said.  Clinton, making history Thursday night by becoming the country’s first woman to accept a major party’s nomination for president, delivered a speech that was in part inspired by a book she wrote two decades ago: ”It Takes a Village.” ”None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone. America needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger,” she said. ”I believe that with all my heart.” It’s a message that appeared to resonate in the convention hall. Anita Green, a    Bernie Sanders delegate from Montana, was a part of the ”Bernie or Bust” movement until Tuesday night, when Clinton was officially nominated. As Montana’s first transgender national delegate, Green said Clinton’s record on same sex marriage isn’t perfect but that it has become clear to her that the alternative is a ”demagogue” who would do nothing to help the LGBTQ community.  ”We need to come together and unite. Unity trumps Trump,” Green said. ”I would like to urge the queer community to rally behind Hillary Clinton.” North Carolina state Rep. Rodney Moore, a Clinton delegate, said the visions of the two nominees couldn’t be more diametrically opposed.  ”She’s offering a message of equal economic opportunity, access to health care, education opportunities for all children regardless of their zip code and strength in our nation and strength in our world,” Moore said of Clinton.  Trump’s candidacy, Moore said, is centered on hate, confusion and xenophobia, ”That’s a message of narcissism and I can solve all of America’s problems, and I don’t need any help to do it.” The start of the Democratic convention was overshadowed by tensions within the party. Sanders supporters protested what they believed was a rigged election, frequently disrupting proceedings inside the Wells Fargo Center and staging a walkout after Clinton’s formal nomination Tuesday.  Democratic National Committee emails released over the weekend that showed committee officials favoring Clinton also led to the dramatic resignation of Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  But coming on the heels of the GOP convention last week in Cleveland, Democrats here also expounded on the theme of national unity and inclusion to draw sharp contrasts between the world views of Clinton and Trump.  The speeches and programming represented communities of a wide range of religions, races and backgrounds, while at the same time, highlighting some of Trump’s most inflammatory statements and proposals, including his signature idea of building a wall on the   border and banning Muslims from entering the country.  In a direct attack against her GOP opponent, Clinton said, ”And most of all, don’t believe anyone who says: ’I alone can fix it.’ Those were actually Donald Trump’s words in Cleveland. And they should set off alarm bells for all of us.”  Democratic strategist Paul Begala said the banner of ”Stronger Together” has been an especially resonant message this election.  ”At a time when the country seems to be coming apart, voters will respond to a call to come together,” Begala said. Stephen Woodruff, a Sanders delegate from Northern Mariana Islands now supporting Clinton, said the message that has resonated most deeply with him this convention is ”love trumps hate.”  ”This is the message of the Democratic Party, that we all should be one, we work together, we support each other, we don’t divide against each other, we don’t fight against people just because of the color of their skin or their religion or their sexual preference,” Woodruff told CNN. ”Basically, her message to the country is the exact opposite to Donald Trump’s message to the country.” Clinton’s speech was met with thunderous applause inside the arena and marked a particularly poignant moment for many of the women in the room.  ”it’s very emotional, it truly is, that I’m able to see this in my lifetime,” said Sally Howard,    South Carolina delegate. ”I have a daughter and two granddaughters: for them to know that being president is not something only men do.”  Two rows behind Howard, South Carolina state Rep. Mandy Powers Norrell, shed tears as Clinton spoke. Powers Norrell said she was thinking about her    daughter. ”It just means so much to know that she has opportunities that are limitless,” she said. ”It’s just sort of overwhelming,” she added. ”It’s so exciting, to know that I was here when history was made. I think I’ll end up going home and watching it again and processing it again at a slower pace.”"

After he wrapped at a Senate session Monday, Biden told reporters about how much he enjoyed working in the chamber over his long career there. CNN asked him jokingly if he planned to run for office again. ”Yeah, I am. I’m going to run in 2020,” Biden responded. When asked by reporters for what position, Biden responded, ”For president. What the hell, man.” On Tuesday, as Biden was heading to the House Democratic Caucus meeting in the Capitol, he answered a question about running with a quip as he walked by.  ”I’m going to announce now,” Biden joked. When he was told by the media on Monday they were planning to publish his quotes, the vice president responded, ”That’s okay.”  Senate holds emotional vote to rename cancer bill after Joe Biden’s late son, Beau, ”No, I’ve enjoyed every minutes of my time here in the Senate.

I learned a long time ago fate has a strange way of intervening.” Biden represented Delaware for 36 years in the Senate before he became President Barack Obama’s vice president in 2008.

The   Police Department responded to a call Tuesday evening that three people appeared to be dead in a Charlotte home. Officers discovered the bodies of Puhar, 19, Jonathan Cosme Alvarado, 23, and Jusmar Isiah   21.  Puhar appeared on ”America’s Next Top Model” Cycle 21, the most recent season of the popular reality TV show hosted by supermodel Tyra Banks. Emmanuel Jesus Rangel, 19, was quickly identified as a suspect in the slayings, brought into police custody and charged with three counts of   homicide. He is in the custody of the Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office. Police said in a press release that it appears the victims and Rangel knew one another and the ”incident was drug related.”  Rangel was also charged in connection with a homicide that took place in Matthews, North Carolina, on Sunday, police said. Puhar was a Serbian refugee who arrived in the United States along with her family at the age of 5, according to a profile in The Charlotte Observer.  The 5’ 9  ” beauty began modeling at 12. She attended high school in the Charlotte area and dropped out at 16 to her parents’ dismay, she told The Observer: ”I was a wild child,” she said. ”I went out, had fun, partied, whatever    I didn’t really have the best influences around me.” She later earned her GED just before being cast in ”America’s Next Top Model.” Puhar was eliminated in the 10th episode of the show last year. After news of her death surfaced, Banks as well as fans and friends took to social media to remember her and express their sadness."

Bush also discussed the booming high tech industry in Estonia, a country where people can vote, pay taxes and get health care information online. He described the country’s technological dependence as a ”moonshot kind of thinking,” and said the U. S. lagged behind because Bush feels Americans have a greater skepticism of government. ”There is a high level of trust with the (Estonian) government and that their data will be protected,” Bush said. ”How we restore trust in government is going to be a great challenge for the next president, for sure.” Bush, who has long been eyed as a presidential candidate, is expected to officially announce his candidacy on Monday.

46036,65047,Tesla is taking a huge risk with the Model 3 — and it may not pay off,Business Insider,Matthew DeBord,2017-01-15,2017.0,1.0,,"’’ ’The biggest test that Tesla and CEO Elon Musk will face in 2017 is the successful launch of the Model 3   vehicle, expected to be had for around $30, 000 once tax breaks and credits are applied.’ ’The Model 3 will deliver more than 200 miles of range on a single charge and benefit, for a fee, from Tesla extensive  which will enable   drives.’ ’After selling $100, 000 luxury sedans for several years and adding a luxury SUV in the Model X in 2015, the company is finally unleashing a Tesla for the rest of us.’ ”Nearly 400, 000   for the Model 3, at $1, 000 apiece, certainly prove that the rest of us is a sizable group. That’s an unprecedented level of advance demand for an automobile, of any sort.” ”But there’s a major problem looming for the Model 3 and Tesla, one that hasn’t yet been thoroughly discussed.” ’Will Tesla be able to afford to build this car?’ ”We’re in the early stages of what could be a major structural shift in the auto industry, away from passenger cars and into SUVs and pickup trucks. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles CEO Sergio Marchionne already says the change is underway. ” ”Other industry leaders aren’t yet ready to give up on cars, but they’re struggling to figure out what to do with small cars: vehicles that are priced in the same ballpark as the forthcoming Model 3. Admittedly, it’s much harder to make a decent profit off a small car that sells for around $20, 000, so Tesla has some cover by pricing the Model 3 about $10, 000 higher. ” ”But it’s still hard to bring in a substantial margin on a $35, 000 car. The best profits are in the vehicles that Tesla is already selling: luxury   and SUVs. In fact, Tesla can achieve an impressive gross margin on these vehicles already, between 20% %.” ’’ ”The assumption is that Tesla’s margins will be consistent and that due to things like lower battery costs thanks to   at the company’s massive Nevada Gigafactory, the Model 3 will be a big moneymaker. ” ”However, Tesla is going in exactly the opposite direction as most other car companies when it comes to the Model 3. A compact SUV, sometimes called the Model Y, is planned, but the first Model 3’s will be modest  . And essentially no automakers doing business in the US are trying to disrupt the low end of the market, as the Japanese and later the South Koreans did when they first arrived.” ’From Hyundai to General Motors, the game is to sell more   luxury and   vehicles, as well as pickups and big SUVs. The smaller, cheaper vehicles serve other purposes: they get customers into the brand earlier, they act as a hedge against rising gas prices, and they provide compliance with more stringent government   and emissions standards.’ ’Until Donald Trump was elected President and started making it difficult for automakers to move their   production to less expensive labor markets outside the US, the emerging consensus in the auto industry was that it made sense to relocate that manufacturing to Mexico, in order to maintain even narrow profit margins.’ ”Building compact   cars in the US, when you could be assembling SUVs instead, didn’t make sense.” ’’ ”Tesla is confident it can buck this trend, in some measure by rethinking how cars are manufactured. In response to a request for some additional insight into this challenge, Tesla pointed me to recent comments from CFO Jason Wheeler, made on Tesla’s most recent earnings call.” ’”On a   basis, the way we’’re thinking about margins is we certainly see opportunities for continued cost downs, both on the engineering front, also on the commercial front as well,” he said. ”We’’ve got a supplier base that is very excited about the Model 3 and is giving us the ability to leverage that for cost downs. Also, we continue manufacturing efficiencies . .. labor hours per car is trending quite positively right now and we’’re   on continued improvement in that key metric. ”’ ”I’m inclined to cautiously give Tesla the benefit of the doubt here  —   its gross margins on the cars it already sells are actually quite impressive  —   but I also don’t want to pretend that there’s some miracle innovation that will allow Tesla to defy the economics of automaking.” ’’ ”And it should be noted that Tesla is kind of making the same mistake with the Model 3 that it made with the Model S  —   bringing to market a car rather than an SUV. You could forgive Elon Musk and his team for not seeing the SUV revival coming back in the early 2010s, when the Model S arrived. But that’s not the case with the Model 3. And because the Model 3 will be built on a flexible platform that could support everything from an SUV to a pickup truck to a sports car, the decision to launch with a sedan is questionable (even if almost 400, 000 potential buyers don’t think so).” ”Mixed in with my skepticism, of course, must be the awareness that Tesla is special. Expecting the company to be beholden to the same rules as everyone else is pointless, because Tesla has created an entirely new market that it has almost entirely to itself. Musk’s team built over 80, ooo   cars in 2016 and sold them all.  ” ”But possessing what is a small monopoly on EVs can’t really protect the company from having to construct hundreds of thousands of   vehicles over the next few years, figuring out as it goes along how to keep up the profit margins. Tesla has crossed the Rubicon: those Model 3’s have to get built. ” ’If the company makes a much smaller margin on them, or even loses money, it will be doing that at scale. ’ ”Luckily, it will still have the Models S and X to fall back on, with their juicy profits. But it might not be enough. And Musk’s vision isn’t to be the preferred automaker of the Silicon Valley elite  —   it’s to save the planet by displacing   cars from the road in major quantities and inspiring other automakers to do likewise.” ”Tesla can’t afford to get this one wrong. And there’s every chance it won’t. But the risks are substantial.” ”UPDATE: Tesla pointed out to me that the Model 3 will be firmly priced at $35, 000, for the base version of the car, and that whatever incentives of rebates the customer receives will be between him and the federal government or the state. I’ve adjusted the story to take into account.”"

But there’s a heightened edge to I, Daniel Blake, an embittered streak of comedy that keeps the otherwise miserable plot from weighing too heavily. Much of that is thanks to Dave Johns, the actor and   comedian who plays Daniel with weary  . Almost all of Loach’s films are polemical, but the best of them present real humanity alongside their politics, and I, Daniel Blake, which won the Palme D’Or at last year’s Cannes Film Festival, is one of his best movies in years. The End of Welfare as We Know It, The film caused a huge stir in the U. K. where its depiction of the country’s draconian welfare workers, and its byzantine Department for Work and Pensions, prompted debate at the highest level of government. The last time Loach made a film this explicitly focused on the current state of his country was 2010’s Route Irish (about contractors fighting in the Iraq War) and the approach gives I, Daniel Blake an immediacy that’s been lacking from some of his other recent work. The film’s action, such as it were, is focused on the job centers that Daniel must repeatedly visit to try and plead for his benefits. Meetings that could feel clinical and dull instead become strangely compelling, as they’re rooted in such horrifying authenticity. The rules and regulations Daniel tries to confront are straight out of Terry Gilliam’s 1985   film Brazil. His doctor says he’s sick, but the government deems him well enough to work, demanding that he immediately start looking for jobs or face sanctions on the benefits he’s entitled to. A widowed carpenter who owns a   cellphone and has never used a computer, Daniel is flustered by the reams of forms he’s forced to fill out online. One particularly wrenching scene sees him trying to file an appeal on a library computer and growing increasingly frustrated as his session times out, over and over again. If it sounds bleak and   well, it is (this is a Ken Loach movie, and those are his specialties) but Johns’s performance has a remarkably light touch. His rage at the situation never overflows into unbelievable histrionics. His despair manifests as a sort of gallows humor, with Daniel offering a running sardonic commentary as every single civil servant he meets tells him he’s in violation of some law or regulation. Loach’s film is a sour satire in which the joke is that the   system has caught up with the science fiction that mocked it 30 years ago. Viewers are stunned at the things Daniel is told —  that a man who just suffered a heart attack is really expected to return to the workforce —  and at the same time, it’s sadly believable. In his trips to the job center, Daniel meets Katie (Hayley Squires) a young single mother of two from London who’s been moved to Newcastle by a government that can no longer afford to house the very poor in the cities they’re from. This character is where the flaws of Loach’s disputatious style are most noticeable. Squires lends a similarly soft, humane touch to Katie, but her storyline spins into more outlandish directions with less time granted to make them feel grounded. Unlike Daniel, she never transcends her symbolism, never feels like a real person, though her situation is an unfortunately common one in a country where a conservative government is trying to roll back many of the core tenets of the social safety net. Loach’s crucial point is that Daniel’s many opponents in the Department for Work and Pensions are not monsters, merely cogs in a faulty machine. In one of I, Daniel Blake’s most telling scenes, a worker finally takes pity on Daniel as he tries to fill out a form online, hovering over his shoulder and directing him, until she is taken aside by her manager and loudly chastised. If she gives one person special attention, she’s told, then the whole system collapses —  better to have unfairness for all, the implication goes. Loach makes his political points with brutal directness, but I, Daniel Blake comes at a particularly brutal time for the world, making it all the more important to see."

Education activists and concerned citizens had lobbied hard against DeVos, but fell short of the extra Republican vote they needed to block her. DeVos, a longtime advocate for   vouchers, has never worked at, attended, or sent her children to a public school, and her lack of experience has critics worried. But the big controversy over her nomination has put education policy in the media spotlight —  and that could be an unexpected boon for public schools. America’s Immigrants: As a federal appeals court prepared to hear arguments on the constitutionality of Trump’s immigration order, DHS Secretary John Kelly took responsibility for the chaos surrounding its rollout, stating that he should have given Congress more notice of the travel ban. However, Kelly continued to defend the contents of the order, which bans immigration from seven   countries for 90 days, freezes the U. S. refugee program for 120 days (indefinitely for Syrians) and has been opposed on both economic and moral grounds. One point on the economic side: Studies show that immigrants play a big role in driving American innovation. Looking back, the refugee experience is central part of U. S. history, and it’s well captured in the writings of Frederick Douglass. Israel’s Outposts: Yesterday, Israel passed a bill legalizing thousands of new Israeli settlement homes on Palestinian land in the West Bank. Only a few days earlier, police had evacuated Amona, an illegal outpost in the same area, clashing in the process with protesting teens who are part of a growing movement pushing Israel to the right. For his part, Trump declined to take an official position on the new settlements, although U. S. policy has opposed such expansions for decades. Here’s a cheat sheet showing where Trump stands overall with Israel and other key countries. From our newest issue of the magazine, Jonathan Rauch on containing Trump: The 45th president, Donald Trump, might pose the gravest threat to the constitutional order since the 37th. Of course, he might not. Perhaps we’ll get   Trump, an unorthodox and controversial president who, whatever one may think of his policies and personality, proves to be responsible and effective as a chief executive. But we might get Infantile Trump, an undisciplined narcissist who throws tantrums and governs haphazardly. Or perhaps, worse yet, we’ll get Strongman Trump, who turns out to have been telegraphing his real intentions when, during the campaign, he spread innuendo and misinformation, winked at political violence, and proposed multiple violations of the Constitution and basic decency. Quite probably we’ll get some combination of all three (and possibly others). If we get Strongman Trump or Infantile Trump, how would we protect our democratic institutions and norms?   …     Meeting that challenge, I think, hinges on whether civil society can mobilize to contain and channel Trump. Fortunately, that’s happening already. Keep reading here, as Rauch examines how civil society can respond to Trump. And read the whole March 2017 issue here. 1.

54176,74600,Table 19 Doesn’t Know Whether to Be Nasty or Nice,Atlantic,David Sims,2017-03-03,2017.0,3.0,,"The titular Table 19 is tucked in the back corner of a wedding reception, a spillover location for the random guests who inexplicably accepted an invite they probably should have ignored. It’s an   premise expanded to a bigger group —  a motley crew of disaffected, embittered, and delusional types who, by the end of the movie, will surely be fast friends, like a matrimonial Breakfast Club. But where that movie found a perfect balance of sweet and sour, Table 19 doesn’t know whether it’s looking to depress or inspire, and so ends up failing in both regards. The Romantic Comedy Is Dying, but Cinematic Romance Is Thriving, Eloise (Anna Kendrick) is seemingly the most   wedding guest, but the writer and director Jeffrey Blitz wants appearances to be deceiving. Table 19 starts out with Eloise wrestling over whether to RSVP, checking both the “yes” and “no” boxes on her invitation before setting the thing on fire in a fit of pique (and then instantly blowing the fire out). This is the first of many hammer blows Blitz delivers to the audience we probably could have guessed at Eloise’s dilemma without her taking such drastic action. But Table 19 can’t do anything by half. So the viewer quickly learns that the married couple at table 19, Jerry (Craig Robinson) and Bina (Lisa Kudrow) can’t stand each other because they use every line of dialogue to unnecessarily snipe about each other’s shortcomings. Awkward teen Renzo (Tony Revolori) is awkward because his mother calls him on the phone every five minutes to ask if he’s talked to any single girls yet. The bride’s childhood nanny Jo (June Squibb) pathetically tries to boast of her own importance to the family though clearly none of them have spoken to her in years. Distant cousin Walter (Stephen Merchant) is only in attendance after getting the weekend off from prison, a fact he disguises by clamming up and parroting the question back at everyone asking what line of business he’s in. It’s all so thuddingly obvious, as is Eloise’s sad state of affairs —  she dated, and was summarily dumped by, the bride’s brother Teddy (Wyatt Russell). But Blitz insists on keeping his characters as broad and unlikable as possible for the first half of the movie, as they size up each other’s worthlessness to the happy couple and confront the bleak reality of being at the losers’ table. Then, just as quickly, Blitz flips the script. The Table 19 crew become fast friends, and they begin to discover their hidden depths, as if the appetizer course consisted of empathy pills. This more humane second half is somehow even more annoying than the bitter first. Blitz just can’t justify the turnaround as anything other than a need to wrap his story up in a timely manner. Kendrick is a perfectly appealing lead in search of a character: Eloise seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown at times, and a     personality at others. It’s a   that never makes sense. The rest of the ensemble seem similarly lost: Kudrow and Robinson (wonderful, subtle comic talents who are often wasted on film) have the most to do, but don’t get nearly enough time to thread the needle on their more complicated relationship arc. Table 19’s many flaws are particularly unfortunate given Blitz’s obvious talent. His first film Spellbound (2002) was a tremendous documentary about the hotbox world of spelling bees, and his debut narrative film Rocket Science (2007) was a promising teen comedy (and featured a younger Kendrick). He’s worked wonders with awkward comedy in the realm of television, from The Office to Andy Daly’s brilliantly dark Comedy Central show Review. But the tone he’s struck for Table 19 is all off, and its pat conclusion feels particularly galling after so much of the movie spends its time trying to subvert   conventions. Hollywood needs more of this genre right now, but Table 19 won’t do much to revitalize it."
54391,74882,Snoop Dogg’s Anti-Trump Video Becomes a Pro-Trump Prop,Atlantic,Spencer Kornhaber,2017-03-15,2017.0,3.0,,"The indignant reaction to Snoop’s satirical video for “Lavender (Nightfall Remix)” is the latest example of how politically themed art can double as a prop for whatever side it’s opposing. The controversial scene comes toward the end of the clip as the culmination of a storyline that imagines a country populated by clowns and “doggs. ” Snoop and directors Jesse Wellens and James DeFina went out of their way to signal that they were working in the realm of satire, fantasy, and cartoonishness, but the shock value of pulling a trigger on a presidential lookalike can’t be denied. The video has certainly succeeded at drawing attention —  but more for its ability to confirm preconceived partisan narratives than for anything it actually said. In the video, a clown dad, played by the actor Michael Rapaport, eats breakfast with his clown family in his clown home, where   bills plaster the fridge. On his way to work, he is pulled over by a clown cop. The dad happens to have his young son’s squirt gun in his briefcase the sight of it leads the cop to shoot him, triggering a spray of glitter instead of blood. Another clown films the incident, which then makes the news. There’s an allegory here, but it’s not exactly the expected one —  both the victim and the cop are white, and the onlooker is black. We then cut to a press conference at “The Clown House” where Ronald Klump, in a red tie and orange face paint, is making a speech. Chyron: “RONALD KLUMP WANTS TO DEPORT ALL DOGGS. ” Later we see Klump with a car full of clown henchmen in burglar’s black apparently about to engage in some sort of strike operation (deportation? drug bust? harmless clown fun? ). Snoop Dogg picks up a gun and interrupts that mission, firing the “bang” at Klump. From there, it’s mostly Snoop partying with Harley Quinn lookalikes while Klump stands in chains at one point, Snoop refuses to share his blunt with Klump. The video closes with a cartoon commercial of an animated dog gunning down clowns who are chasing him for his Snoop Loops cereal. The video has attracted far more attention in the   political media world than it has in the music world. The chatter has partly been over the idea that Snoop is inciting violence as Marco Rubio told TMZ, “The wrong person sees that and gets the wrong idea, you can have a real problem. ” But perhaps as much attention has gone to the idea that Snoop is illustrating liberal hypocrisy about peace and civility —  hence Trump’s tweet. What the coverage hasn’t seemed particularly focused on is what Snoop might have been trying to do artistically. On Fox News, the Democratic strategist Richard Fowler was scoffed at when he tried to interpret the video as an   statement. On Fox Business, an outraged Maria Bartiromo shouted “What’s the point?” without any   attempt at actually answering the question. Talking to Billboard, Snoop portrayed the video as an   expression of frustration at “police, the president, and just life in general . .. The whole world is clownin’ around. ” He also explained that when he releases something new he doesn’t “expect or look for a reaction,” adding, “I just put it out because I feel like it’s something that’s missing. Any time I drop something, I’m trying to fill in a void. ” Critics are right to say that big blowback would have met a video like this about Obama. Just as blowback met the rocker Ted Nugent when he said he’d risk his life and freedom to stop Obama’s   or when former Trump New York campaign   Carl Paladino wished Obama would be infected with Mad Cow disease. Trump’s mention of the “jail time” Snoop would have received under Obama might be a reference to some publicized enforcements of U. S. Code Title 18, Section 871’s ban on presidential threats, including the case of the army clique suspected of planning a coup and the Brooklyn ISIS sympathizers alleged to have talked about a suicide mission against Obama. But there are significant differences between Snoop and those examples, and even between Snoop’s video and something like Paladino’s comments. For one, Snoop is an artist making a piece of art. For another, he doesn’t actually say he wants the president to die. The Obama years were obviously not lacking for fights over the propriety of vitriolic, murderous expressions against the president. Many such expressions were rooted in a   version of him, whether the racism of birtherism or the more general belief that liberalism is a   plot to destroy America. Snoop’s video vents at Trump’s actual policy positions, from immigration, to law enforcement, to the war on drugs. That Snoop’s life and art have been influenced by such issues over the decades may explain the video’s vividness, though it doesn’t inoculate him from criticism for using an inflammatory allegory of assassination. Whatever his intentions, the entire episode feels familiar. At the Women’s March on Washington in January, Madonna said she had thought about blowing up the White House —  but also said she knew the sentiment was wrong and that she disavows it. In doing so, she did what artists often do: air their honest reactions to the world. But her comments seemed to catch on more with her political opponents than her allies —  because they provided an opportunity to portray Trump’s critics as wackos. The same thing appears to be happening now. Artists certainly have a right to make explosive, exploratory art. But now, especially, such art can serve ends they may not want."
54474,74966,The Most Important Vote in the U.S. Senate ,Atlantic,Michelle Cottle,2017-03-18,2017.0,3.0,,"Why Are Democrats Holding Back on Gorsuch? Day to day, the work is pretty straightforward. If a member has a nitpicky question about how to handle an arcane motion, he takes it to MacDonough —  typically well before an issue reaches the floor so as to avoid looking publicly foolish. Though appointed by leadership, the parliamentarian strives to be nonpartisan, steeped not in politics but in the   minutiae of the chamber’s history. (The Senate runs according to a relatively small number of “standing rules,” along with a Trump   body of precedents.) When the Senate is in session, the parliamentarian sits on the dais at the front of the chamber and, any time a “point of order” is raised about whether proper procedure is being followed, advises the presiding officer on how to proceed —  or not. Parliamentarians avoid the media and, in general, strive for professional obscurity. But every now and again, this anonymous Senate staffer winds up in a position to decide the fate of     legislation. And just like that, she is thrust onto the radar screens, and into the crosshairs, of ideological warriors,   interest groups, and other assorted obsessives. The brewing storm over Ryancare —  or, if you prefer,    promises to be one such moment, suggesting that MacDonough should brace for an acute onslaught of crazy. Here’s the lay of the land: Republicans’ ability to repeal and replace Obamacare requires Senate Leader Mitch McConnell to ram through much of the overhaul via the   path of reconciliation. This means rejiggering whatever bill clears the House to suit at least 50 of his 52 members. It also means convincing MacDonough that the overall plan meets the requirements of the Byrd Rule. Adopted in 1985, the Byrd Rule aims to keep budget reconciliation from getting bogged down in “extraneous matter” unrelated to deficit reduction.  The rule sets six tests for determining extraneousness. Some are straightforward, such as a provision’s not being allowed to futz with Social Security. Others are highly subjective, most notably that a provision must impact federal “outlays or revenues” in a way that is not “merely incidental to the   components of the provision. ” Translation: Reconciliation cannot be used to achieve   policy aims (for instance, curtailing access to guns or abortion) disguised as deficit reduction. The “merely incidental” mandate, as you might imagine, leads to much argument, interpretation, and budget trickery. When that happens, who is charged with making the final call on the legislative intent underlying a bill and, by extension, its eligibility for reconciliation? You guessed it: the parliamentarian. When a hot policy like Ryancare heads toward the Senate, the parliamentarian suddenly becomes the most popular person on the Hill. Emissaries from all sides of the debate descend on her office to lobby for or against provisions in a practice adorably known as “the Byrd bath. ” “If I’m in the minority, I’m going to say that all these provisions right here trigger Byrd Rule points of order,” said James Wallner, who spent many, many hours in the parliamentarian’s office during his 12 years as a Republican Senate aide. The bill’s supporters, meanwhile, work to tinker with —  or if necessary trash —  certain provisions to suit the parliamentarian. There are nuances to this dance that members and staff quickly learn, said Wallner, now head of research for the conservative Heritage Foundation. Parliamentarians don’t deal with hypotheticals. (“You have to have text. ”) They can get cranky if you pester them about their process. (“If you’re a staffer, the quickest way to frustrate the parliamentarian is to ask for the specific precedents on which they are basing their advice. ”) And if the parliamentarian decides a bill has too many extraneous bits, she can deem the whole thing fatally flawed. “She would then say, ‘OK. This bill’s no longer a reconciliation bill,’” explained Wallner. That, needless to say, would be the end of Ryancare. Particularly with    legislation, it pays to start strategizing early, said Jim Manley, a former Senate aide to Democratic leadership. “This is   weeks and or months beforehand. It’s complicated, legalistic stuff, and you want to have your ducks in a row. ” Indeed, from the   some of Ryancare’s elements were tailored to with an eye toward making the plan “Byrdable. ” Even so, there remain several, such as the 30 percent surcharge on premiums for people who don’t keep continuous coverage, that conservative critics (including Senator Mike Lee, National Affairs’ Yuval Levin, and health policy analyst Christopher Jacobs) insist do not pass the sniff test. Which means MacDonough is likely to be making some significant —  and controversial —  calls in coming weeks. This burden comes with all manner of professional risks. For starters, although largely treated as an independent operator, the parliamentarian serves at the pleasure of Senate leadership. And leaders have been known to fire a parliamentarian who issued advice they didn’t like. In 2001,   Robert Dove refused to clear parts of the GOP’s budget plan for reconciliation. Out he went, to be replaced by his deputy, Alan Frumin. It’s not just lawmakers who get upset. With an issue as toxic as health care, outside activists can get downright scary when they disagree with the parliamentarian. Frumin held the post during the original Obamacare debate in 2010. He denied use of reconciliation for the primary legislation. But when he cleared it for a   bill that made budgetary adjustments to the ACA, opponents went berserk, and Frumin started receiving death threats.    More subtly, for all the time and energy spent wooing the parliamentarian, her approval isn’t binding. MacDonough’s official duty is to offer expert advice on the rules to the Senate’s presiding officer. But the presiding officer has no obligation, beyond tradition, to heed that advice. Either the presiding officer or the Senate president (Vice President Mike Pence) are free to ignore MacDonough and allow whatever provisions they want to roll on through.   This is the course favored by some Republicans in both the House and Senate. (Senator Ted Cruz, unsurprisingly, loudly opposes deferring to an unelected staffer on such vital matters.) Other Republicans, however, see dissing the parliamentarian as another form of “going nuclear” akin to killing the legislative filibuster. This sort of talk makes institutionalists (among them Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell) verrrrry nervous. Either way, having her recognized authority questioned by an increasing number of lawmakers is hardly a happy development for MacDonough. Neither is being portrayed as a stumbling block to killing the Obamacare —  or, alternatively, as a Republican toady looking to snatch health care coverage from 24 million Americans. Now, maybe MacDonough will catch a break. Maybe Ryancare won’t make it out of the House. Or maybe already anxious Republican Senators will smother it before it comes to the floor. Or maybe Donald Trump will suddenly become a   fan, and this entire debate will go back to square one. These days, nothing is impossible. Even so, MacDonough should prepare for the possibility that she is about to have her fifteen minutes of fame —  which, in a job like hers, can be a giant pain in the backside."
55626,76601,More Than Just a Symbol,Atlantic,,2016-04-02,2016.0,4.0,,", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. National polling, primary results, and numerous articles have highlighted the unexpected gap in support that Hillary Clinton is seeing among young women —  a demographic that had once been favored to help her clinch the 2016 election. While many of this group’s questions about Clinton’s candidacy focus on an array of issues similar to those brought up by the broader electorate —  including her connections with Wall Street and a thorny email investigation —  a particular view has emerged among young women: While they are excited about a female president, they want somebody who is more than just a symbol. At a February rally for Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire, actress Emily Ratajkowski said just that when explaining her support for the Vermont senator: “I want my first female president to be more than a symbol. I want her to have politics that can revolutionize. ” In a piece by my colleague Molly Ball, one woman interviewed about Sanders took this position one step further, saying Sanders is “‘more  ’ than Clinton. ” And in a recent Politico article, Molly Roberts lamented that, for Millennials, Clinton’s gender is “simply not enough to make her a groundbreaker. ” How Should the World Respond to Terrorism? The argument is that young women don’t want to support Clinton, or be told they should, solely on the basis of gender, namely because doing so would be reductive. In a New York Magazine story, for example, Carly Gilmore, a Wesleyan University freshman, said: “The idea of voting for a woman purely for the fact that she’s a woman —  that’s really almost the opposite of what we’re talking about in our feminist movement. ” In a Los Angeles Times piece, college student Meg Renzelman echoed this sentiment: “There is this assumption that if you are a woman, you should support Hillary Clinton because she is a woman   …     But I feel like Bernie is going to support women in the same way. ” Given this perceived framing of the conversation —  that young women should vote for Clinton simply because she’s a woman —  Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright’s now much   remarks didn’t do much to help. Instead, Steinem and Albright seemed to suggest that, yes, they were telling women how they should think and act, based on a responsibility to their gender. (This is troubling because it reinforces   biases that there is a right and wrong way for women to behave.) But are Millennials really being asked to support Clinton for no reason other than to shatter the glass ceiling? Unfortunately, because that message has been repeatedly linked to Clinton’s campaign —  yet never directly espoused by it —  its noise obscures the deeper reasons that young women should support Clinton. It’s not just that she’s a woman it’s that she has fought for women her whole career. *** For decades, Clinton has prioritized bills and policies promoting reproductive rights, equal pay, and family leave —  far more so than Sanders. This is not to say that Sanders has not supported such legislation or practices. The key difference is that, for him, they simply haven’t been as much of a priority. This very distinction is the reasoning that Planned Parenthood and NARAL   America offered when they endorsed Clinton as the Democratic candidate earlier this year —  while still acknowledging that both she and Sanders have held strong positions and voting records on abortion rights. As noted by Kaylie Hanson, the NARAL   America national communications director: “His voting record is sufficient, but it doesn’t make him a champion for women. That champion is Hillary. ” And while this perspective may seem like a matter of opinion —  especially from organizations that Clinton has long had close ties to —  it’s further evidenced by the way each candidate has run their campaigns and addressed the issues. A January Time article describes the Clinton campaign as making reproductive rights the centerpiece of her policy plans, while Sanders has been criticized by the president of Emily’s List, Stephanie Schriock, for neglecting to “mention anything about abortion, contraception, or reproductive care anywhere in his entire health plan. ” A similar dynamic is apparent on the issue of equal pay. While she was a senator, Clinton spearheaded the development of the Paycheck Fairness Act (introducing three versions of it during her time in Congress) and she was also part of the original set of cosponsors of the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, both of which are aimed at achieving equal pay for women in the workplace. Again, Sanders backed both bills, but he was not part of the group of lawmakers that developed them or the one leading the charge. He and Clinton share extremely consistent voting records on equal pay, yet her approach to the problem has been significantly more proactive. While he has often helped provide invaluable support to the cause, she’s the one who has put the issue front and center. On the subject of family leave, too, Clinton has consistently been at the helm of its advancement. As first lady, she was a powerful advocate for the Family and Medical Leave Act, which became one of the first that Bill Clinton signed into law as president in 1993. The act was among the earliest federal laws to require companies to offer 12 weeks of unpaid leave to parents and caregivers. And in 2007, paid family leave became a cornerstone of Hillary Clinton’s first White House campaign. More recently, Clinton and Sanders both rolled out plans for a   paid   program, but they disagree on how to finance it. Sanders proposes a nominal tax on all households, and Clinton argues that only wealthier households should cover the costs. Sanders is currently a cosponsor of the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, introduced by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, which includes the   plan —  and he has taken Clinton to task for her lack of support for the legislation. Arguably, Clinton still needs to refine her approach and response. That said, her leadership on the topic, and past work ensuring it was a key part of the congressional agenda, spans more than 20 years. The possibility of paid family leave today —  which Clinton has been criticized for calling “politically challenging” based on her past experiences —  only exists because of the stepping stones that she helped establish with the Family Medical Leave Act more than two decades ago. Interestingly, her contributions on this front are also emblematic of the broader results she has delivered on a host of issues, laying the groundwork —  some would say “incrementally” —  for more revolutionary policies to ultimately flourish. The theme that comes up again and again across all these areas isn’t that Sanders doesn’t back policies that benefit women it’s that, for him and his campaign, they are what they’ve always been —  one more issue on the docket, not a key focal point. On many of these topics, he’s a strong ally, but not an active initiator of change. This recurring pattern becomes even clearer when examining the bills that Sanders’s campaign cites on FeeltheBern. org as positions he has taken to address women’s issues, including his involvement with the Freedom of Choice Act. For all of the examples listed, he is either a cosponsor or someone who has voted in support of a policy, rarely the one who introduced or initiated legislation. In some cases, he’s one of hundreds of members of Congress who cosponsored a bill. Such a trend helps bolster his reputation as a friend to women’s causes, but it underscores his lack of leadership on the topic, too. Clinton’s leadership and active advocacy for women’s issues, on the other hand, is a common thread that is present throughout her time in public life. While at the State Department, she established the first federal Office of Global Women’s Issues to ensure that gender equality is a cornerstone of   practices, including through partnerships with local entrepreneurship programs across Africa and Southeast Asia aimed at helping women’s businesses succeed as well as plans to engage women in diplomacy and   in places like Burma and Afghanistan. Her efforts to support women’s rights domestically and globally are no ancillary concern: They are intrinsically tied to the core of the work she does. In her own Senate office —  where Clinton was known for aggressively ensuring that the men and women who worked for her were equally paid and were offered   time —  this underlying thread is especially apparent. The public release of Clinton’s email tranches revealed numerous occasions when members of her staff were granted extra vacation days around the holidays to spend more time with their families. And when   Slaughter, the department’s policy planning director, suggested Clinton do the same to let employees know it was all right, Clinton did just that, leading by example. As Slaughter said at an Atlantic Live event earlier this year: “I knew Hillary Clinton cared. I talked to her about having kids when she hired me. ” What’s more, during her time as senator, Clinton hired twice as many women as men to work in her office —  a proportion that upends the overwhelming trend in Washington. *** There are, however, many prevailing questions that Clinton still needs to answer. Take, for example, her   proposal: Clinton advocates for $12, while Sanders argues for $15. An increase could have a significant impact on improving conditions for   workers overall,   of whom are women. Clinton must continue to explain the more measured approach she is taking. Thus far, The New York Times has found little empirical support for her claim that businesses wouldn’t be able to afford the hike. Clinton has also been criticized on numerous occasions for her lack of commitment to “intersectionality” —  the concept that several forces perpetuate inequality and compound one another, including systemic discrimination on the basis of gender, race, income, and sexual orientation. By placing an emphasis on gender, critics have claimed that Clinton disregards the other factors that contribute to inequality. College student and feminist activist Jazmin Martinez laid out some of her concerns in an article for The New York Times: Clinton’s feminism will supposedly fight for women, but what kind of women is she about? Does she include women who work in the fields and grow her food? Women living in fear of being deported or having broken families because of deportation? Indigenous women and black women? Or is her feminism just about white women trying to make it in the corporate world? Women doesn’t just mean white,   and educated, but her brand of feminism makes it feel like it does. As an affluent, white woman, Clinton is seen as representing a kind of feminism that is narrow and dated. It’s a view that partly conflates her personal identity with the actual actions she has taken, but it also holds her accountable for policies and views that aren’t intersectional —  like her support for President Bill Clinton’s 1994 Violent Crime Control Act, now considered one of the largest contributors to the nation’s increasing rates of mass incarceration, and her   support for gay marriage. Clinton has since stated that she has learned from these decisions and that they were mistakes, but many wonder if such seemingly politically expedient pronouncements are enough. As reported by my colleague Clare Foran, in response to concerns about Clinton’s commitment to intersectionality, the campaign has recently focused its message on spotlighting the relationships across and between issues —  a step that could be seen as an insincere ploy but perhaps should be seen as an acknowledgment that she needs to improve her approach to these disparities. While it’s vital to call Clinton out on the areas where she falls short on intersectionality, it’s also important to note how often she doesn’t. After all, components of the idea have long been part of her legislative platform. She has advocated extensively to protect the health insurance of   children, playing a pivotal role in establishing the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, and she was one of two cosponsors on the Safe, Orderly, Legal Visas and Enforcement Act, which pushed for comprehensive immigration reform in 2003. Plus, Clinton’s use of the term “intersectionality” itself marks one of the first times a major political candidate has explicitly referenced the concept in a broad public conversation —  certainly a meaningful step toward increasing general awareness and application of it. As is so often the case with her candidacy, there is much Clinton must answer for —  but there is also much she has achieved. Reckoning with the contradictions that she embodies is one of the toughest challenges that Clinton faces. But to call her just a “symbol” is a major discredit to the concrete progress she has made and to the qualifications she possesses. Talk about reductionist. Like any candidate, Clinton needs to be asked tough questions and pushed for answers. But to suggest that Millennials are being asked to vote for her simply because she is a woman, and not because she would be good for women, is foolhardy and dismisses Clinton’s deep experience championing and prioritizing women’s issues domestically and globally. In fact, contrasting Clinton’s and Sanders’s approaches, it’s clear that she’s not simply a supporter of policies for women she’s a leader."

Track of the Day: ‘Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me’ by Low
",Atlantic,Chris Bodenner,2016-11-22,2016.0,11.0,,"   Readers recommend their favorites. Submit your own —  especially if the cover goes across genres —  via hello@theatlantic. com, and please include a short description of why you love it so much. Matthew gets bleak: I bring you Low, covering The Smiths’ “Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me. ” The original is fine in its own way, if a little mawkish. But Low, a band quite comfortable working with the space between notes and then building from the depths to the heights, wrings every last bit of longing and despair out of this cover. Just hide the razor blades before you hit “play. ” (Submit a song via hello@. Track of the Day archive here.   archive here.) A   rendition of Woody Guthrie’s legendary folk song: But it comes to us bittersweet Sharon Jones died Friday night of pancreatic cancer at the age of 60. I caught wind of her death while catching up with the weekend postings of the Atlantic reader group known as TAD. As one reader put it: What a badass. Like Candye Kane [the blues singer] she fought it right up to the end and going out the way she wanted to go. Fuck cancer. Another adds, “While I was saddened to hear of her passing, it’s nice to know she died after having the best year of her professional life. ” And it appears she kept her sense of humor till the end: [As] the  ’ Gabriel Roth tells The LA Times, Jones suffered the first of the two strokes that would hasten her death while sitting at home watching the election results at November 8. “She told the people that were [at the hospital] that Trump gave her the stroke,” Roth says. “She was blaming Trump for the whole thing. ” Roth is quick to add that this was nothing more than a bit of   banter, though, and that Jones remained in good spirits surrounded by family, friends, and fellow musicians until suffering another stroke Wednesday. That stroke left her unable to speak, but she still sang. As Roth puts it: She was just moaning at first, and then she was moaning in tune and then she started following chord changes and pretty soon she was humming “His Eye On The Sparrow” with [  member Binky Griptite]. We all just kept playing and singing with her, and little by little over the next couple of days she actually started moving her mouth and started singing lyrics. She just wanted to sing these gospel songs . .. (Submit a song via hello@. Track of the Day archive here.   archive here.) From reader Max: While I love the Peter Green Fleetwood Mac original (from a time when Fleetwood was a British blues band) Judas Priest takes the song from hard blues to metal. “The Green Manalishi” has more menace when Rob Halford sings it. The   attack takes it someplace harder and meaner. Priest takes this song where Peter Green couldn’t quite take it, but probably looked at and nodded. There’s a reason the cover is the more famous version. (Submit a song via hello@. Track of the Day archive here.   archive here.) This cover song submitted by reader Max not only jumps genres in a big way but transforms the song into satire: Originally a raunchy   rap by the Ying Yang Twins, comedian Mark Jonathan Davis’ Richard Cheese recorded this largely as filler to a “greatest hits” album. But by swanking it up, slowing it down to Old Man River speed, the lyrics take on new —  though no less vulgar or sexist —  meaning. The narrators’ quest for a badd bitch (original title) is transformed from idle bragging to a deep yearning and appreciation (admittedly for the travails of exotic dancers). While I would never hold either as great art, Cheese is great satire, and occasionally he finds a deeper truth rather than just another dick joke. For a much more earnest version of “Badd” —  though more of a sampling than a cover —  see Girl Talk’s “Minute by Minute”: Update from Max, whom I’ve hopefully converted to Girl Talk fandom: Damn, that track is fun to take apart. The yacht rock is deep in the covers . .. Aretha covers Doobies with Toto . .. Ying Yang twins with a backing sample of Michael McDonald’s “I Keep Forgettin” at :50. Probably taken from Warren G’s “Regulate. ” Keep it smooth. The full list of 16 tracks sampled on “Minute by Minute” is here. I’ve previously gushed about Girl Talk with a reader here.

A reader, Tom Schroeder, tries to lift us up as we approach the end of this death march of an election: Aretha Franklin’s cover of “What A Fool Believes” is the best thing you will hear today —  a bright light in dark times. The original version is a breezy number with Michael McDonald [of The Doobie Brothers] on vocals and a fun little synth line going on. You all know this song it’s planted firmly in anodyne   canon (even serving as the central plot anchor in the first episode of Yacht Rock, a    devoted to lovingly lampooning that era and genre). It won Grammys. Wikipedia calls it “one of the few   No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 during the first eight months of 1979. ” Let’s fix that, said the Queen of Soul the following year. And oh, does she. There’s brass. There’s a   solo. There’s an ostentatious sax entrance near the end. There are, of course, delightful vocal vamps punctuating the whole thing. Best of all? Aretha managed to record a decidedly    cover of a yacht rock song —  with backing musicians from Toto.

A reader dissents: Your Track of the Day feature is opening me up to new music I appreciate, from the cover series to the locations series and all the rest. Notably lacking is any mention of Ry Cooder. This is a serious failing that really needs correcting. I’m still especially fond of his first three albums (that’s what cool people say, isn’t it: “yeah, I like his old stuff”) but his work over several decades has been phenomenal, not least being The Buena Vista Social Club. I seem to recall him being referred to as a music archivist or curator as much of his opus involves his take on much older songs from Calypso to blues. One of the best guitarists of our time, it is his arrangements that make so many of his songs unique and identifiably Ry Cooder’s. Among his many covers, it’s really difficult choose a favorite, but I’ll offer up Lead Belly’s “On a Monday. ” The mix of slide, electric and Dobro is superb. My favorite cover of a Lead Belly song is from Nirvana —  “In the Pines,” embedded below —  and it’s a bit more transformative than Cooder’s cover due to the     so it’s a tad more fitting for this series.

Reader Marc pivots off our track from Thursday by Willie Nelson: Although I do love “City of New Orleans” (sadly, I’ve never ridden the train nor visited the city) I didn’t hear it until some time after I heard —  and fell in love with —  a song by Joe Dassin set to the same tune: “Salut les amoureux” (“Hello, lovers”). It’s about a couple who are going for a walk to have The   Talk. At first neither of them has anything to say. Then, as they talk, they imagine that their relationship might be rekindled —  but “we’re past that age we don’t believe in fairy tales anymore. ” At last, having settled their   they pass the local café, where the proprietress sees them walking together and calls out “Hello, lovers!” Joe Dassin had an interesting story he was the son of Jules Dassin, a Hollywood director who moved to Paris after being blacklisted by HUAC. (Jules became famous in France for Rififi and Never on Sunday moved back to Hollywood after the Red Scare died away, and was nominated for an Oscar for Topkapi.) Joe, having spent his teenage years in Europe and his college years in Ann Arbor, somehow emerged as one of the biggest French pop stars of the ’60s and ’70s. More than a few of his hits were French lyrics set to songs that were popular in the U. S. at the time sometimes they were fairly straight transpositions —  The Doors’ “Mosquito Song” became “Le Moustique” —  but others were, like this one, complete  . This isn’t my favorite Joe Dassin song —  that would probably be “Mon village au bout du monde” —  but I like it a lot. The   lyrics to “Salut les amoureux” are full of wisdom and pathos: The mornings pass and look the sameWhen love embraces the everyday lifeWe weren’t made to live togetherLoving each other isn’t enoughIt’s funny, yesterday we were boredAnd we barely foundWords to talk about the bad weatherAnd now that we must goWe have a hundred thousand things to sayWhich are too important for so little time, We loved each other the same way as we’re splitting upSimply without thinking of tomorrowFor tomorrow that always comes a little too fastFor goodbyes that sometimes happen a little too well, We do what we have to, we play our rolesWe look at each other, we laugh, we show off a little bit, We always forgot somethingIt isn’t easy to say goodbye to each otherAnd we know too well that sooner or laterMaybe tomorrow or even tonightWe’ll say that everything isn’t lostFrom this unfinished novel, we’ll make it a fairy taleBut we are too old to believe in this, We loved each other the same way as we’re splitting upSimply without thinking of tomorrowFor tomorrow that always comes a little too fastFor goodbyes that sometimes happen a little too well, Romeo, Juliet and all the othersAt the heart of your books, sleep in peaceA simple story like oursIs one that will never be writtenCome on little girl, we have to go, And leave our memories hereWe’ll go outside together if you wantAnd when she’ll see us go byThe owner of the coffee shopWill still say ”hello lovers” We loved each other the same way as we’re splitting upSimply without thinking of tomorrowFor tomorrow that always comes a little too fastFor goodbyes that sometimes happen a little too well, (Submit a song via hello@.

After seeing David’s note yesterday on the literary qualities of “Tangled Up in Blue,” a reader, Keith Wells, recommends another Dylan song: Bob Dylan being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature was stunning, more for how long it took than anything else! It reminded me of a song to recommend for your cover song series: “Desolation Row” by My Chemical Romance. They took the   opus and cut it down to a   burst of   anarchy.

There are very mixed results because it’s obviously an outpost for “amateur” musicians (i. e. there are too many punk bands with Ramones covers to count) but there are many, many pros who put things up just for kicks. And they’re usually free. Example: Anthony Lamarca and his album Songs I Wish I Wrote. His cover of John Cale’s “Big White Cloud” —  the original being kind of artsy treacle —  is one of my most listened to songs of the past few years. The intimacy of Lamarca’s version is arresting versus the baroque Cale arrangement. Lamarca has backed or supported many big artists and bands —  St. Vincent, Spoon, War On Drugs, Dean Wareham (Galaxie 500). Another: Shilpa Ray’s take on Lou Reed’s classic “Make Up. ” Reed’s original camp and macabre is replaced with Ray’s brand of powerful burlesque pop. (Submit a song via hello@.

Reader Bruce submits a Lera Lynn cover of the Johnny Cash classic: Where Cash’s ring of fire is the blazing love that symbolizes passion with its upbeat tempo, Lynn’s is melancholic, as if the hellfire of love has descended into the lover’s heart. With no hope, we wait to burn. Any other covers of Cash’s song you really like? Drop us a note and I’ll update. Update from Richard: “Elvis Costello’s version of ‘Ring of Fire’ is marvelous his voice really captures the emotions and the arrangement and production are  . ” From Peter: “I love Social Distortion’s version —  a bracing blast of   punk. ” From Matt, with a reggae version: “You asked a few days ago so perhaps you’ve moved on, but here’s a cover of ‘Ring of Fire’ by Grace Jones. ” (Submit a song via hello@.

S. when it was first released as a single: Man, I feel like the covers project needs some hemoglobin. Lenny Kravitz? My arteries run blue. Here’s Dwight Yoakam covering Cheap Trick’s “I Want You to Want Me. ” In addition to being awesome, it’s one of those rare covers that would have worked on its own, without the frisson of association. And it’s a cheap out, but Postmodern Jukebox’s jazzy covers of pop hits are reliably great, if best in individual doses. I think you posted on the Dish via me their cover of Wham’s “Careless Whisper. ” Their “All About That (Upright) Bass” is even better. Update from reader Mike Kludt: Since Dwight Yoakam is the subject, how about his cover of “Crazy Little Thing Called Love”? He does a nice job, but to me it highlights the versatility of Queen, a group that produced songs ranging from that one to “Stone Cold Crazy” and “Bohemian Rhapsody. ” Speaking of versatility, Yoakam gave a surprisingly stellar acting performance in Sling Blade, the movie that gave Billy Bob Thornton his big breakout. Yoakam played the sadistic stepfather figure to the boy protagonist and could have inspired a sequel called Lawnmower Blade. (Submit a song via hello@. Track of the Day archive here.   archive here.)

Here you will find them doing a fine cover version of “Toxic” by Britney Spears. Jen Hance covered the cover eight years ago: [It] was originally written for Britney Spears, and even won a Grammy in 2005 for Best Dance Recording. With the immense success of the song, there is no wonder why it has been covered numerous times by bands such as Local H, The BossHoss, The Zoo, and even Kevin Federline’s ex, Shar Jackson.

57317,78696,California’s Deadly Wildfires,Atlantic,J. Weston Phippen,2016-06-27,2016.0,6.0,,"   I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. The fire that began last week in Kern County, California, has destroyed more than 150 homes, burned almost 50, 000 acres, and killed two people. About 2, 00 firefighters are battling the blaze, known as the Erskine Fire, which was 40 percent contained by Monday. The fire is burning in the mountains around Lake Isabella, 150 miles north of Los Angeles. Hundreds of people in several communities have evacuated their homes. Many have had to stay in evacuation centers since shortly after the fire began on Thursday. Weather has been a major factor in the fire’s explosive growth, and in the difficulty of containing it. As the Los Angeles Times reported, the coming week’s near   Fahrenheit temperatures pose a huge challenge: “With those temperatures, there’s not a lot of humidity to work with,” said Carlos Molina, a National Weather Service meteorologist. “Conditions up there are dry right now. It’s favorable for the fire to continue growing at this rate. ” Molina said the conditions would likely persist throughout the week. Further complicating matters, Molina said, if moisture from a monsoon currently in Arizona reaches to Kern County, it could cause thunderstorms and lightning that may spark additional fires. Four consecutive years of drought have dried up much of California’s mountain ranges. A record 26 million trees have died in the Sierra Nevada mountains since October, partly due to lack of water, and partly due to a bark beetle infestation. The abundance of dead trees has given fires this year plenty of fuel, and already in 2016 about twice as many acres have burned compared to this time in 2015. Currently, seven fires are burning in the California."
57787,79318,Michael Jordan Speaks Up About Police Violence,Atlantic,Juleyka Lantigua-Williams,2016-07-25,2016.0,7.0,,"   Michael Jordan, NBA    and reluctant role model, has ended his   reluctance to speak about anything political by weighing in on racial relations and police brutality. In a statement published by ESPN’s The Undefeated, the basketball icon said he is “deeply troubled by the deaths of   at the hands of law enforcement” and “angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers. ” Jordan recalled the “senseless act of violence” that ended his father’s life in 1993 when he was shot while sitting in his parked car at a rest area on a North Carolina highway. “I grieve with the families who have lost loved ones, as I know their pain all too well,” Jordan said. In what might be a significant shift for the   NBA champion, Jordan offered an overtly political message as he discussed what he perceives as an escalation in biased commentary lately. “I am saddened and frustrated by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem to be getting worse as of late. I know this country is better than that, and I can no longer stay silent,” he said. Many public and private figures, including fellow basketball icon Kareem   have chided Jordan openly for his perceived reticence to discuss   issues, and pressured him to use his massive celebrity and influence to bring attention to issues that impact blacks in the United States. Jordan may have also found it more palatable to speak up during a time when star athletes like LeBron James have leveraged their celebrity to take serious stands on   issues. Most recently, the WNBA rescinded a series of fines levied on players who wore   with messages in support of police shooting victims. In his statement, Jordan made sure to applaud and commend police officers for the dangerous and important work they do, while also admitting his own privilege as a wealthy and famous American. “I also recognize that for many people of color their experiences with law enforcement have been different than mine,” he said, adding that he urges the country to engage in dialogue and education that can lead to change. And he’s putting his money where his mouth is by donating $1 million each to the International Association of Chiefs of Police for a   program, and to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. "
57988,79547,Another Expectation-Smashing Jobs Report,Atlantic,Bourree Lam,2016-08-05,2016.0,8.0,,"        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, The July jobs report is out, and it has smashed expectations. On Friday morning, the Labor Department reported that the U. S. economy added 255, 000 jobs, while the unemployment rate remained at 4. 9 percent. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal were expecting a modest 179, 000 jobs added. After a fantastic jobs report in June, fears that U. S. job growth is slowing down were largely quelled. But the July jobs report will reinforce beliefs that the hugely disappointing May jobs report was a blip, and that the   trend shows the U. S. economy to be on a trajectory of robust growth. Monthly Changes in U. S. Employment ( )   Employment gains were seen in the     and financial sectors, while the mining industry continues to lose jobs. Since September 2014, the sector has lost 220, 000 jobs, or 26 percent of its jobs. The Department of Labor’s jobs reports come with revisions to previous months’ reports, and this month’s revisions have good news too: Both May and June’s numbers were revised up —  from 11, 000 to 24, 000 and from 287, 000 to 292, 000 respectively —  solidifying June’s position as one of 2016’s best jobs reports. This month’s revisions bring the   average to 190, 000 jobs added per month. U. S. Unemployment Rate,   And there’s more good news in the July jobs report, regarding wages and the   participation rate. Average hourly earnings rose by eight cents, to $25. 69, following a   increase in May and a   increase in June. In the past year, average hourly earnings have risen by 2. 6 percent. The   participation rate moved up slightly —  it’s now at 62. 8 percent —  after April and May wiped out gains from earlier this year. All in all, July’s report is solid, but skeptics will wait to see if this is indicative of a   trend of steady growth.  Two consecutive strong jobs reports have also brought back talks about the possibility of an   hike in September, or at least a rate hike before the end of the year. At the Federal Open Market Committee’s July meeting, interest rates were left unchanged after a stellar June jobs report. But with June and July’s undoubtedly positive jobs reports, concerns regarding uncertainty about the U. S. labor market and the impact of Brexit on the U. S. economy have eased up. There are three Fed meetings before 2016 ends, and the minutes of the July Fed meeting —  to be released August 17 —  will be closely watched for projections."

"," Saudi Arabia cut ties with Iran, the Kingdom’s foreign minister announced on Sunday, deciding ”enough is enough” with the Islamic Republic, according to a source with knowledge of the Saudi government’s thinking. ”Enough is enough,” the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. ”Again and again Tehran has thumbed their nose at the West. They continue to sponsor terrorism and launch ballistic missiles and no one is doing anything about it. The Saudis really don’t care if they anger the White House.”   The move comes amid escalating tensions between the countries following Saudi Arabia’s execution of a prominent Shiite cleric on Saturday. A group of Iranians attacked the Saudi Embassy with Molotov cocktails and stones earlier Sunday following the death of Sheikh Nimir   and the Saudis have indicated they don’t believe the Iranian government tried to stop the protesters. Iran Deputy Foreign Minister   suggested the Saudi government was using the severing of diplomatic ties as a way to distract from  ’s death, FARS news agency reported.  Saudi Arabia has ordered its personnel back from Iran and asked the Iranian diplomatic mission and other entities to depart the Kingdom within 48 hours, Reuters reported. Saudi’s Foreign Minister Adel   announced the move during an address aired by Al Arabiya News Channel. He said Iran wouldn’t be allowed to undermine Saudi Arabia’s security. The Obama administration urged ”diplomatic engagement” between the countries.  ”We believe that diplomatic engagement and direct conversations remain essential in working through differences and we will continue to urge leaders across the region to take affirmative steps to calm tensions,” U. S. State Department Spokesperson John Kirby said in a statement.    who was convicted of terrorism charges but denied ever advocating violence, was executed Saturday along with 46 others, including three other Shiite dissidents and a number of Al Qaeda militants.   was a key leader in the Arab Spring protests in Saudi Arabia before his arrest in 2012. His execution drew condemnation from Shiites across the region as well as several countries outside Iran. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei condemned the execution Sunday in a statement on his website, saying   ”neither invited people to take up arms nor hatched covert plots. The only thing he did was public criticism.” Iran’s Revolutionary Guard also lashed out at Saudi Arabia Sunday. They compared the executions to attacks carried out by ISIS. The Guard said in a statement that Saudi Arabia’s “medieval act of savagery” in putting   death will lead to the “downfall” of the monarchy. The Guard promised “harsh revenge” against the Saudi royals for the execution, according to Reuters. The cleric’s execution could also complicate Saudi Arabia’s relationship with the   government in Iraq. The Saudi Embassy in Baghdad reopened for the first time in nearly 25 years on Friday. On Saturday there were public calls for Prime Minister Haider   to shut the embassy down again. Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shiite Iran are already locked in a bitter rivalry, and support opposite sides in the wars in Syria and Yemen. Iran accuses Saudi Arabia of supporting ”terrorism” in part because it backs Syrian rebel groups, while Riyadh points to Iran’s support for the Lebanese Hezbollah and other Shiite militant groups in the region. The Associated Press contributed to this report. "

","The shooting happened around 4 a. m. after officers stopped a car near a parking garage of Caesars casino. At least one of the men in the car opened fire, Atlantic City police Chief Henry White. Investigators are looking for five people described as suspects or persons of interest, according to acting Atlantic County Prosecutor Diane Ruberton. Authorities released video later Saturday afternoon showing six men they said were ”persons of interest” in the case. The shooting occurred when the officers ”approached a group of individuals engaged in criminal activity,” prosecutors said in a statement, though they did not disclose further details about what the men were doing. The wounded officer was shot and injured as he exited his vehicle. The second officer returned fire and struck at least one of the suspects. The struck officer, whose name was not released, was taken to nearby AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center. He underwent surgery Saturday morning. The New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association offered a $20, 000 reward for information on the remaining suspects in the shooting. ”Our hearts are heavy at this hour, but our resolve to capture these suspects remains undeterred,” said Patrick Colligan, the association’s president. ”We ask for prayers for the officer, his family and the Atlantic City Police Department.” Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian called the shooting ”a sad commentary on society.” ”These are good examples of what happens when too many of these assault weapons are in the wrong hands,” he said. The shooting happened during the final big summer weekend for the shore resort and two days after a man fatally shot a store manager and then shot himself at a popular outlet shopping mall near where Saturday morning’s shooting occurred. The shooting also happened as the resort town prepared for the effects of Tropical Storm Hermine, which was expected to start bringing wind and rain later Saturday."

The Carson campaign also blamed Cruz’s camp for leaking confirmation of the meeting to the media, and Carson spokesman Jason Osborne suggested the leak was a calculated attempt to repair Cruz’s image. “We weren’t going to comment to the press on it, but it seems pretty clear that the other party involved had a different agenda,” Osborne told the Beast. “How else could we perceive that to be?” Another unnamed GOP operative said the Cruz campaign apparently wanted to hold the meeting on “neutral ground,” so they selected a convention center storage closet. Journalists were reportedly calling the Carson campaign even while the meeting was still underway. A member of Carson’s Secret Service detail guarding the door told an operative simply: “Yeah they’re in that closet,” according to the report. Carson has repeatedly blamed his disappointing fourth place finish in Iowa on Cruz for using “dirty tricks” on the trail. On the night of the caucuses, the Cruz campaign sent out communications to supporters that said Carson was leaving the presidential race, and Cruz backers should rally Carson voters to instead cast their vote for the Texas senator. Cruz responded by blaming CNN, which had reported the “breaking news” that Carson was traveling home to Florida for “fresh clothes” after Iowa, rather than traveling directly to New Hampshire as is typical.

69573,99010,Gov Snyder To Drink Flint Water For At Least A Month To Prove That It’s Safe,Talking Points Memo,,2016-04-18,2016.0,4.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160419023406/http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/rick-snyder-drink-flint-water-month
","LANSING, Mich. (AP)  —   Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder will drink Flint water at home and at work for at least a month to show to residents it is safe with the use of a faucet filter, he said Monday. The Republican governor, who has apologized for his administration’s role in the city’s   water crisis, visited a house that had been confirmed to have high levels of lead and left with five gallons of filtered water. He said he understands people feel that if officials say the water is OK, then he should drink it, too. ”What better way to help show support,” said Snyder, who will get refills from other homes as needed. For nearly 18 months, Flint residents drank and bathed with improperly treated water that had coursed through aging pipes and fixtures, scraping away lead. By the time Snyder announced in October that Flint would return to its earlier source of treated water, the Detroit municipal system, dangerously high levels of the toxic metal were detected in the blood of some residents, including children, for whom it can cause lower IQs and behavioral problems. Meanwhile, a state   official who told the city of Flint that a chemical wasn’t needed to prevent lead corrosion from pipes has taken a different job in the state Department of Environmental Quality. Mike Prysby, who was a district engineer with the Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance and had been responsible for Genesee County, home to Flint, began working in the Water Resources Division’s Transportation and Flood Hazard Unit on March 28. That was the day before a supervisor at Flint’s water plant, Mike Glasgow, testified at a legislative hearing that Prysby told him before Flint switched to a local river for water in 2014 that phosphate wasn’t required. DEQ spokeswoman Melanie Brown said Prysby took a position that opened up when someone was promoted, and his switch was not a forced transfer. ”The department continues to cooperate with internal investigations regarding staff actions in Flint,” she told The Associated Press in an email. A message seeking comment was left Monday for Prysby, who has declined previous requests for an interview. Snyder has blamed ”career bureaucrats” in state and federal governments. A task force appointed bySnyder has said the DEQ was the primary culprit because regulators misinterpreted a federal rule in telling Flint water officials not to treat the Flint River for corrosion until after two   monitoring periods. The DEQ’s director and communications director resigned in December. Snyder fired the department’s top drinking water official, and a district supervisor is on paid leave after being suspended five days without pay in January for actions related to the Flint crisis  —   the maximum allowed under civil service rules.

","’The US has a surplus in agricultural trade. ’] Shortly after Donald Trump’s election victory, a beef industry representative said it was “a new day in Washington and the country as a whole. ” In November, rural America voted for Trump with hopes that he would rollback environmental regulations and support the ethanol market, which is fueled by corn growers. Many rural towns flipped from Democrat to Republican. “Farming and agricultural processing are the predominant industries in a majority of the counties that changed from blue in 2012 to red in 2016,” The Hill reported. Yet as the President follows through on   campaign promises  —   withdrawing from the   Partnership during his first week in office and preparing to renegotiate the NAFTA deal with Canada and Mexico  —   farmers have become unsettled. “Trade is more important to agriculture than any other sector of the economy,” Dan Glickman, a   US Agriculture Secretary and executive director of the Aspen Institute Congressional Program, told BuzzFeed News. Major members of the US farm lobby say their members have been big beneficiaries of the trade deals that send American beef, corn and grain across the world, “TPP and NAFTA have long been convenient political punching bags, but the reality is that foreign trade has been one of the greatest success stories in the long history of the U. S. beef industry,” said the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, the beef industry’s lobbying group, in a statement. Trump is now reevaluating NAFTA, a deal that opened up trade between the US, Mexico and Canada 23 years ago  —   and which beef producers are big fans of. Kent Bacus, director of international trade and market access at the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, told BuzzFeed News that NAFTA is “a near perfect deal” and said it “was one of the greatest trade agreements we could have asked for. ” Others in the farming business are concerned about Trump’s     positions on immigration. Of all American industries, farmers have the most to lose from a tighter policy on immigration, The Economist reported, and undocumented immigrants make up more than half of the workforce on farms, according to the U. S. Department of Labor. Idaho dairy farmers, who rely on immigrant labor, have started a petition to highlight their need for immigration reform. Kristi Boswell, congressional relations director for the American Farm Bureau Federation, said in a podcast, “We want to make sure our workforce is legal and valid to work in the United States. However, the reality is over half of our workforce is undocumented, and so we want to make sure there is thoughtfulness by the administration in their approach recognizing the nature of our workforce. ” Meat producers have been quick to point out that their competitors overseas  —   particularly in Australia  —   will likely capitalize on the collapse the proposed TPP trade deal with Asian countries. In a joint letter last week, beef and pork producers called on the Trump administration to “initiate free trade agreement negotiations in the   region beginning with Japan. “While we may not agree with the decision to withdraw from the TPP, we respect that this is the position of the U. S. government, and we request that you prioritize securing strong market access to   markets for U. S. beef and pork exports,” the letter stated.  "

72140,104975, Harvard Graduate Sues School Over Handling Of Reported Sexual Assault,Buzzfeed News,Mary Ann Georgantopoulos,2016-02-17,2016.0,2.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160217224801/https://www.buzzfeed.com/maryanngeorgantopoulos/harvard-graduate-sues-school-over-handling-of-reported-sexua
"," Alyssa Leader filed the lawsuit against the school Tuesday in Massachusetts federal court, saying Harvard violated the federal gender equality law known as Title IX by showing “deliberate indifference” to her reports of sexual assault, abuse, and harassment.  Leader and the man  —   referred to as John Doe in the lawsuit  —   dated for about one year from 2013 to 2014. According to the lawsuit, Doe would pressure Leader to have sex during what she described as an abusive relationship. When she refused, he grew violent, at times slamming doors and aggressively striking furniture including a metal bureau, a fan, and a porcelain sink. Harvard began an investigation in February 2015, after Leader filed a formal school complaint against Doe for abuse, sexual assault, and harassment, according to the suit.  On several occasions during the investigation she asked that Doe  —   who lived in the same dormitory as her —   to be moved, but her request was denied. Leader alleges in the lawsuit that she was forced to encounter her abuser and his friends daily in the dorm.  “She went to Harvard seeking protection, seeking help,” Irwin Zalkin, Leader’s lawyer, said during a news conference Wednesday. “She expected the university would take action and protect her safety at the school. She was wrong. ” A spokesperson for Harvard University said the school does not comment on pending litigation. “Harvard responds fairly and purposefully to every allegation of sexual assault among its students, faculty, and staff,” the statement said. “In recent years, the University has adopted a new Title IX Policy and Procedures, created a new office to investigate allegations of sexual assault and other forms of harassment, and increased training and resources to both prevent and respond to incidents. ” Harvard College is currently under federal investigation for claims that the university mishandled cases of sexual violence. Leader said Wednesday that after she reported the assault she was living “in constant fear” of Doe. According to the lawsuit, he would show up at her workplace, made threatening comments to her in the dining hall, and spoke widely about the investigation with people on campus. She claims in the lawsuit that she was also harassed by Doe’s friends, who would stand outside her workplace so she would have to pass them when she left. She reported the subsequent harassment and her fear to the university, but they still refused to move him from the dorm, according to the lawsuit.  According to the lawsuit, Harvard investigators questioned how the conduct constituted harassment as it occurred in public.  She began carrying pepper spray in her purse and used furniture to barricade doors when she was alone in a room, she said at the news conference. According to the lawsuit, her grades began to drop. She said she felt ostracized and barred from attending social events. She ultimately stopped sleeping in her dorm room out of fear. Seeing that the school investigation was not progressing, Leader obtained a restraining order from a state court against Doe in April 2015  —   a month before the two were set to graduate. The same day she was granted the restraining order, Harvard moved Doe out of the dormitory they lived in.  “I stood in the middle of the quad and cried,” she said at the news conference about the day Doe was moved out of the dorm. “Finally, I felt safe, but it was too little too late. ” Leader alleges in her lawsuit that Harvard did not inform her of her right to pursue a criminal case or a restraining order, which Title IX mandates. She claims they failed to discuss other measures such as changes in her class schedule, leaves of absence, or increased monitoring of certain areas of the campus.  According to the lawsuit, Harvard “failed to properly train and educate their employees, including officials, officers, investigators, and adjudicators in appropriate response t o allegations of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, and retaliatory conduct, as well as necessary Title IX policies and procedures. ”  “Title IX requires universities to take action to protect students from ongoing harassment,” Zalkin said at the news conference. “While conducing an investigation they have to take action to protect the victim. ”  According to the lawsuit, Doe admitted to verbally threatening Leader, acting violently during the relationship, showing up at her workplace, and discussing the case with their friends.  In July 2015  —   two months after Leader and Doe graduated  —   Harvard found the man not responsible for sexual assault, abuse, and harassment.  "
73321,109122, A Tale Of Two Schemes And One Pyramid,Buzzfeed News,Matthew Zeitlin,2016-07-16,2016.0,7.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160716094344/https://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/a-tale-of-two-schemes-and-one-pyramid
"," Is that a pyramid on the horizon? Or is it merely a large,   pile of stone blocks? It’s all about perspective, as two recent federal investigations into suspicious marketing schemes have shown. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission went after a maker of nutritional drinks. The company told   customers they could get rich by selling its products  —   all they had to do was recruit a network of people to buy the health drinks from them. Those recruits would recruit more people into their own networks and resell the goods, which would eventually be sold on to real consumers. The whole scheme would create a lucrative web of payments that could replace a full time job, the company claimed. The structure of that payment network was distinctly  . “Rather than focusing on selling products,” the FTC said, the company “uses false promises of high income potential to convince consumers to pay money to join their organization. ” The FTC prosecuted the drink seller as an “alleged pyramid scheme,” citing the claims it made: that its sellers, which it called affiliates, “can earn substantial income by enrolling others” in the scheme. The focus was not on finding end consumers to actually buy the products, but on recruiting new layers of people who pay commissions upward and recruit more people beneath them. The company, the Federal Trade Commission said when announcing an injunction to halt the scheme, “focuses on recruitment rather than retail sales of its products to generate this income,” and while some people at the top were getting rich, “the vast majority of participants make no money, and most of them lose money. ” The company, which earned over $200 million a year from the scheme, is currently defending itself in court. Its name is Vemma Nutrition. Today, the Federal Trade Commission made another announcement regarding a large multilevel marketing scheme involving nutritional products, with over 500, 000 distributors operating in the U. S. alone. Its distributors primarily made their money not from selling the supplements and drinks to consumers, but by recruiting new distributors. The company, the FTC said, “deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial money selling diet, nutritional supplement, and personal care products. ” It told potential distributors in brochures that they could “quit their jobs, earn thousands of dollars a month, make a   income, or even get rich. ” “In truth, the only way to achieve wealth,” the FTC said in its complaint, “is to recruit other Distributors. ” The vast majority of distributors made little or no money, and signing up to the scheme caused them “substantial economic injury,” the FTC said. So the FTC took it to court, alleging it was an illegal pyramid scheme. Except, it did not do that. Instead, the regulator reached a settlement with Herbalife, the publicly listed nutritional products company, which is currently valued at $6 billion. For years, billionaire investor Bill Ackman has campaigned against Herbalife, betting against its stock and arguing it is a pyramid scheme that will eventually collapse  —   either because the authorities will shut it down, or because it will run out of new sellers to recruit. The shutdown option looks less likely after today’s settlement. When asked by reporters whether or not Herbalife was a pyramid scheme, FTC chair Edith Ramirez carefully hedged her words, saying “the focus was less on the label but rather making sure the complaint adequately alleged what we are concerned about. ” Ramirez said that the goal of the complaint was to put out what it believed were “unfair and deceptive practices” on the part of Herbalife and to “obtain relief promptly and in a timely fashion, as opposed to litigating for perhaps years. ” When asked again about the similarities between Herbalife and past companies that had been prosecuted as pyramid schemes, Ramirez woudn’t say whether or not Herbalife was a pyramid scheme. “I will leave to you to draw that conclusion,” she said. Herbalife will not face a court trial, but the FTC’s settlement requires it to restructure its business and monitor what portion of its products are actually sold to consumers, as opposed to those that are moved around among layers of distributors. The company will also pay $200 million as compensation to distributors harmed by its business. Herbalife will have to “revamp its compensation system so that it rewards retail sales to customers and eliminates the incentives in its current system that reward distributors primarily for recruiting,” the FTC said. Overall, “at least 80 percent of Herbalife’s product sales must be comprised of sales to legitimate ” the regulator said. Herbalife was less circumspect than Ramirez in giving itself a clean bill of health. “The settlements are an acknowledgment that our business model is sound and underscore our confidence in our ability to move forward successfully, otherwise we would not have agreed to the terms,” Herbalife’s chief executive officer Michael Johnson said in a statement. The company said that it felt that many of the FTC’s claims were “incorrect,” but that the settlement was “in its best interest because the financial cost and distraction of protracted litigation would have been significant. ” The company said that the settlement only affects its U. S. sales which are about a fifth of its total business. Herbalife and its shareholders can now breathe a sigh of relief. The company’s stock rose over 11% on Friday, and is sitting at its highest level since early 2014. In late 2012, Ackman gave a three hour long presentation in New York where he alleged that Herbalife was a pyramid scheme and that the shares would fall to zero. He has said he would pursue his bet against the company “to the end of the earth. ” Since then, Ackman has led a full scale media campaign against the company, including collecting dossiers on top Herbalife distributors. Pershing Square did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  "
73674,110413, Marriage Equality Generates Unprecedented Backlash In Mexico,Buzzfeed News,J. Lester Feder,2016-09-08,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160908045614/https://www.buzzfeed.com/lesterfeder/marriage-equality-generates-unprecedented-backlash-in-mexico
"," Opponents of marriage equality have announced protests throughout Mexico this month, hoping to kill a proposal from President Enrique Peña Nieto that seeks to override barriers to marriage for   couples remaining in 21 of Mexico’s 31 states. A coalition called the National Front for the Family is organizing a protest Saturday in cities throughout the country, including one in Guadalajara that organizers claim could attract as many as 100, 000 people. A   march is planned to converge in Mexico City on September 24. In protests held last weekend, including one in Mexico City under the banner of “For Life and Family,” organizers delivered a petition reportedly signed by 300, 000 people calling on Congress to pass a constitutional ban on   marriage. The protests won the endorsement of a group of Catholic bishops, who circulated a letter declaring “we support and encourage the coalition” and calling on their peers to “encourage and promote enthusiastic and creative participation of all individuals, families and groups” in the upcoming marches.   couples have been able to marry in Mexico City since 2010, and full marriage equality has been established in 10 states since then. But those gains have largely been made by quietly bringing dozens of lawsuits in a    litigation strategy. The Supreme Court first ruled that state bans on   marriage were unconstitutional in 2012, but that ruling attracted little attention because technicalities in the country’s legal system mean the court can’t change state laws with a single sweeping judgement. This process has created a situation where “some people in some states or entities have certain rights and others don’t,” said President Peña Nieto during an event in May, which is why he proposed a national constitutional amendment that would allow   couples to marry throughout the country. Many LGBT activists were initially jubilant at the president’s support, but as the backlash grew in the months that followed, some now wonder whether his intervention was actually helpful. “I think it hurt us a lot that someone like him to get involved at that moment,” said Cristian Galarza, outreach director of the Mexican Pride Front, a new group created to respond to the ongoing backlash. It didn’t help that the proposal was announced after Peña Nieto’s approval ratings had plummeted to beneath 30 percent amid a wave of corruption scandals. “The religious organizations had not taken notice of how much we advanced in the courts,” said Alex Alí Méndez Díaz, legal director of Equality Mexico and the lawyer who pioneered the successful marriage equality litigation strategy. The president’s proposal is “very limited,” Méndez said, and weakness in the language of the president’s proposal might not actually remove the legal barriers for   marriage in state law. Passing it would be mostly a “symbolic advance,” he said, but added, “even though this is a bad proposal, it needs to pass. ” The president’s office did not respond to request for comment. The president’s proposal has faced an uphill battle from the beginning. Leaders of Peña Nieto’s own Institutional Revolutionary Party in Congress responded to his announcement by declaring they would not consider the proposal in the legislative session that began September 1. Peña Nieto is in an even weaker position to force the issue than he was in the spring, after his approval rating dropped to 23% following his meeting with Donald Trump. The proposal appeared to be all but dead as the session began, though a senator from the   minority Party of the Democratic Revolution announced Tuesday that he was attempting to revive it by introducing a proposal very similar to the president’s. This rapid politicization is a new challenge for Mexican LGBT groups. The country has never had a strong national LGBT rights organization, and infighting has sometimes made collaboration difficult. But there’s been a new level of communication following the president’s announcement, activists say, including a meeting that drew activists from across the country to the city of Cuernavaca late last month that hammered out principles to respond to the growing backlash. They are now putting a good deal of effort in trying to flip the debate into a referendum on the separation of church and state. Mexico has a long tradition of limiting the church’s involvement in politics  —   for much of Mexican history priests were not allowed to vote  —   and LGBT activists are trying to portray religious opposition to marriage equality as crossing a bright line. On Monday, Equality Mexico filed a formal complaint against the Archdiocese of Mexico with the Ministry of the Interior, alleging that the church had violated constitutional limits on church political activity by directly opposing the marriage equality proposal. They followed this with a similar complaint against the Archdiocese of Tijuana and complaints against other archdioceses are reportedly in the works. Méndez, the group’s legal director, told BuzzFeed News he was prepared to take the matter to the Supreme Court if national authorities did not sanction the church for actions like directly opposing the president’s legislative proposal in church publications and “fomenting hate speech. ” (In an apparent response to such criticism, the spokesman for Mexico’s top bishop issued a statement in late August asserting some distance between the National Front for the Family marches, saying the church had not “convened” the events and asserting that they are not intended “as a protest against a legislative proposal. ”) On September 11, the day after the first of the marches, the National Pride Front will respond with its own march to Mexico City’s cathedral to defend a “secular, democratic, and plural state,” which Galarza said could attract 5, 000 to 10, 000 people. Despite the backlash, Galarza said he is optimistic that legislators will reject the conservatives’ arguments and ultimately take up some form of the president’s proposals. “We have no fear because the legislators of our country are going to understand that they legislate for everybody,” Galarza said. “For sure it’s going to be considered. ”  "

","  doubts about the legitimacy of the president (of whatever party) have become fashionable in the 21st century, but in the   to President Trump’s inauguration, their intensity has spiked. No doubt many in the media and the partisan opposition would be lobbing some of these attacks against any Republican the claim that Trump is shockingly terrible would be more persuasive if similar denunciations had not been leveled against Mitt Romney, John McCain, and George W. Bush. Nevertheless, the fierceness of the   backlash is striking. Popular narratives to the contrary, Trump’s election is less a cause of our current crisis than a sign of it. In the months ahead, then, we need to attend to the conditions that have led to such a radical disruption in our politics. Normally, radical outsiders don’t win the presidency. In looking for a president, the American people usually balance a taste for novelty with a respect for experience. So it’s telling indeed that Trump is the first person elected to the presidency without any prior experience in elected office or other government service. Only when the mandarins of consensus have proven both so parochial and so inept could such an outsider have smashed his way into the White House. A series of institutional failures led to President Trump’s ascendancy. We have been treated to the spectacle of an elite that has promised too much and so often failed so spectacularly. Our public rhetoric has been frozen by nostalgia and an elite reliance on what Josh Barro has called “  politics” to enforce a narrow consensus on immigration, trade, and other issues. Trump’s campaign was powered by denunciations of various debacles over the past decade, whether in foreign affairs, the economy, or national security. And yet Trump still ended up with the most commanding Electoral College majority of any Republican in a generation. Although that majority hangs on a relatively slim number of individual votes, the fact that Trump achieved that result despite massive institutional opposition is a sign of how dissatisfied voters were with the status quo and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the alternative it offered. (That American politics offered only Hillary Clinton as a plausible, competitive alternative to Trump in the general election is itself a searing indictment of the current status quo.) If we are interested in defending republican governance, we should not cheer this crisis of institutional faith. Institutions diffuse power and cultivate the networks of trust and competence that are crucial for maintaining civil society. In order to address the current crisis, we should focus on the reform of institutions rather than the destruction of them. In that narrative, President Trump is a threat to the republic and must be “resisted” at all costs. Paranoia should replace  . Accusations of treason or malice should supplant the presumption of patriotic good faith (even when we disagree). The monologues of those who fancy themselves the virtuous should replace a vigorous public debate. This is like plucking out your eye because you think that you have glaucoma this procedure might remove glaucoma from your body, but you still won’t be able to see. If you think that Trump’s election is a   crisis, blowing up the cultural norms necessary for republican life is a counterproductive strategy in the extreme. Believing that President Trump is himself destroying those norms is no excuse for torching them yourself. The Republic will be preserved by nurturing the soil of healthy political norms  —   not by a race to create a wasteland. Instead of projecting all the ills of America onto President Trump, we should confront them directly. Those who aspire to political power need to recognize their obligations to the electorate they serve. Leaders should look at the challenges of the moment with open eyes instead of simply exulting over past successes or wallowing in past failures. The snideness that has too often proven a handmaiden for complacency should be put aside. In facing these challenges, any effort to “get beyond politics” will likely be a distraction. Political contests arise because we disagree, and some of the problems of the present can be attributed to an effort to enforce a stifling conformity on many cultural and political issues. What we might need to recover instead is a way of doing politics: mediating disagreement, expanding political rhetoric beyond vituperation and     bromides, rebuilding constitutional norms, and shaking off the debilitating comforts of nostalgia. A significant component of these present challenges involves rhetoric that reflects, and reinforces, certain intellectual commitments that have calcified our politics. But there are more directly practical tasks, too: revising the federal bureaucracy, updating   and   strategies, reinvigorating the economy, and working to rebuild a sense of civic belonging (so that Americans feel cooperatively responsible for rather than alienated from the institutions of governance). Some of these tasks will weigh more on congressional leaders, some more on the executive branch. Some are federal others, local. Most of them, though, will involve efforts by both elected representatives and the citizenry at large. In Notes on the State of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson proposed that “the manners and spirit of a people . . . preserve a republic in vigor. ” The Founders recognized that the health of a republic relies on the moral and intellectual constitution of its people. Civil government depends on civil society, which itself is made up of the efforts, habits, and beliefs of the citizens of a nation. Our current political crisis is in part a product of broader cultural trends. We can face these challenges by embracing a spirit of charity, by striving to listen, and by attending to our commitments to our fellow men and women. In the maelstrom of disruption, we should hope for the best and try to see it in each other.,"

","I am beginning to suspect that the Democrats are not acting entirely in good faith. Protests have been convened, and a national crisis declared, over the Trump administration’s promised expansion of Obama administration policies restricting some refugee inflows from the Middle East and identifying the residents of certain   countries as likely threats subject to heightened scrutiny. The Democrats are behaving as though President Trump had just commissioned a very large order of Zyklon B. As the Editors have pointed out here, both the list of targeted countries and the policy of using executive action to prohibit U. S. travel by members of suspect populations date from the Obama administration  —   they are not   innovations. These of course were not the only   innovations nor the most significant of them. Only a few months ago, the idea of using unilateral executive action to limit the travel not of foreigners and   holders but of U. S. citizens  —   and to strip them of specific constitutional protections under the Bill of Rights  —   thrilled Democrats, who described all opposition to such   abuse of civil liberties as indulgence of terrorism. Stripping away the constitutional rights of purported terrorism suspects  —   U. S. citizens who had never even been charged with a crime, much less convicted of one  —   “isn’t politics, it’s common sense,” declared Representative Ted Deutch (D. Fla. ). Hillary Rodham Clinton supported stripping U. S. citizens of their constitutional rights in a secret process without trial or hearing or presentation of evidence, as did Senator Bernie Sanders, President Barack Obama, and practically every other Democratic figure of any consequence. Strange, that. But then, who complained when the Obama administration announced its policy of assassinating U. S. citizens as part of the   war on terror? A few libertarians, Glenn Greenwald, and one   at National Review. So, to review: Stripping away the actual constitutional rights of U. S. citizens without due process through a secret   process without appeal, trial, or representation?  . Ordering the assassination of U. S. citizens because one of them is, in your considered view, “the Osama bin Laden of Facebook”? Kill away. But telling a few Iranians that they are welcome to travel anywhere in the world they like except the United States? Panic and alarums. I wrote a few days ago that blind and unthinking opposition to a president is only a variation on blind and unthinking obedience, and that I myself intend not to do anything blindly and unthinkingly. I have advocated using the visa and immigration systems as an   tool since long before Donald Trump was a presidential candidate, much less president. I concur with my colleagues that his botching the executive order brings unhappily to mind the “amateurism that dominated his campaign,” i. e. the impression that Trump and his associates give of not knowing what in hell they are doing, and would add that it seems to me that a policy change of this scope should be led by Congress rather than by the president, whose proper role is not the making of new law but the execution of existing law. Perhaps congressional Republicans could rouse themselves to take an interest in this. Democrats do not object to this sort of presidential arrogation, only to the president doing the arrogating. Here, I have a premonition of scoffing: “Oh, that’s just  !” You’ll remember “” which was the Democratic talking point of the day a few weeks back. And they’d have a point if the argument were: “It is acceptable for President Trump to do things that are wrong, illegal, or unconstitutional, because President Obama did those things, too, or similar things. ” But that isn’t the argument at all. The argument is: Democrats are fundamentally unserious, opportunistic, and dishonest in their assessment of what is happening, believing that they can simply use Trump and Trumpism to discredit conservatism and perhaps mortally wound the Republican party. Alas, that “amateurism” the Editors mention promises to give them ample opportunity to do just that. But no   person with a sincere desire to actually understand what is going on in American politics should take Chuck Schumer’s tears very seriously. The Democrats are happy to do what Trump contemplates doing  —   and much worse  —   not to foreign nationals and     but to American citizens at home under the protection of the Constitution. Which is to say, if you dislike Trump and believe that the credible alternative to his approach is that of Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi, you are mistaken. The Democrats stand ready not to inconvenience the citizens of other countries but to strip citizens of this country of their rights, so long as they get to be in charge of doing it. If you not only failed to speak up against the Obama administration’s   assault on the Bill of Rights but cheered it, then I do not want to hear very much from you about the Trump administration’s denying visas to   Somali immigrants or Sudanese tourists."

How’s that possible? ”Trump: “No, I didn’t say 10 years. ” —   April 19, You know, [Cruz’s] father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald’s being, you know, shot. I mean the whole thing is ridiculous. What is this, right prior to his being shot, and nobody even brings it up. I mean they don’t even talk about that. That was reported, and nobody talks about it. But I think it’s horrible. I think it’s absolutely horrible that a man can go and do that, what he’s saying there. Fox host: “Right. There was a picture out there that reportedly shows Rafael Cruz standing with Lee Harvey Oswald . . . ” Fox host: “Crazy. ” Parsing Trump sentences is a challenge, but is rewarding because it frequently reveals that he actually has said nothing at all. When silence descends, there lingers in the air only gauzy innuendo. What did Trump really say about “the whole thing” of Oswald? Looking on the bright side  —   speaking of challenges  —   Trump’s nomination might have two salutary effects: It might counteract “The Cult of the Presidency,” as explored in Gene Healy’s 2008 book with that title. And it might reacquaint Republicans with the reality principle  —   the need to assess and adapt to facts. RELATED: This Election Is not an   Test, Healy analyzes the delusion of “redemption through presidential politics. ” The infantilization of America is apparent in the presidency becoming a   office, one that conflates spiritual yearnings and magical thinking about wonders performed by executive power. Trump, with his coarse character and fanciful promises, is an antidote to such superstitions. Now, regarding realities: In 2012, 93 percent of   Republicans who voted did so for Mitt Romney. Trump probably cannot receive 80 percent of what probably will be, because of discouragement and revulsion, a smaller Republican turnout. Romney lost 73 percent of the Hispanic vote Trump is viewed unfavorably by 82 percent of Hispanics and very unfavorably by 62 percent. Trump probably will receive significantly less than Romney’s ruinous 27 percent of this vote. And because of demographic trends and Trump’s motivating policies and insults, Hispanic turnout probably will be significantly larger than in 2012, as the white percentage of the electorate continues to shrink. Romney won just 37 percent of young voters (18 —  29) Trump is unlikely even to match this. RELATED: Dear Republican Politician: Let’s Talk about Donald Trump, Although Romney won 53 percent of married women, he received just 44 percent of the total female vote. Today, Trump trails Hillary Clinton among women by 19 points (35 percent to 54 percent) and most women probably do not yet know that he testifies to the excellence of his penis. (“My fingers are long and beautiful, as, has been   are various other parts of my body. ”) Or that his idea of masculinity is to boast about conquests of women “often seemingly very happily married” and that “I have been able to date (screw). ” Or that he says “it doesn’t really matter what [the media] write as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass. ” More Donald Trump Trump’s Morning Joe TweetsA Question Needing an AnswerIs Immigration to the U. S. an Entitlement? In receiving, so far, the support of 4. 7 percent of America’s eligible voters, Trump has won a mere plurality of votes in a party approved by only 33 percent of the electorate. This electorate had about 5 percent more Democrats than Republicans even before Trump further tarnished the GOP brand. So, Republicans need to carry independents by more than Romney’s five points. Even in states that have voted Republican since 2000, Trump is viewed unfavorably by 62 percent and strongly unfavorably by 52 percent. His metabolic urge to be scabrous guarantees that Republican candidates everywhere will be badgered by questions about what they think about what he says. What they say will determine how many of them lose with him, and how many deserve to.,"
80038,120943,The Return of Ticket Splitting,National Review,Jay Cobb,2016-09-20,2016.0,9.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/440202/ticket-splitting-votes-hillary-clinton-republican-senate-candidates-could-win
","Republicans have made considerable gains over the past several cycles: They now control both houses of Congress and many lesser offices as well. In particular, the GOP controls 31 state legislatures while splitting power in an additional eight. Many of these seats are up again this year  —   and the fear is that, with the controversial and historically unpopular Donald Trump heading the ticket, it’s all endangered. Conventional wisdom has it that voters don’t split their ticket anymore. They don’t vote for a president of one party and for the state assembly with another. Pundits point to statistics showing how   dwindled over the past several decades. We are too polarized party identification is too strong. During the period between 1968 and 1992, Republicans held the White House for all but one term (and even then, they lost by only 2 percent) including the blowouts of 1972 and 1984. But the Democrats held on to the House. Why was that? Because voters in the South had little affinity with the northern, urban, liberal wing of their party at the presidential level, but would vote for local Democrats. Many of those local Democrats were very similar on policy to the Republicans, especially on foreign policy. An example that comes to mind is Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, who was a Democrat in the ’80s. He didn’t change, his party did. Recently, I’ve noticed that Nancy Pelosi has been trying to tie House Republicans to Trump’s worst comments. This makes sense for her, as her objective is to win back the speakership. But Hillary has taken a different stance. In her “ ” speech, she tried to appeal to Republicans by denouncing Trump as not part of their party, saying, “This is a moment of reckoning for every Republican dismayed that the Party of Lincoln has become the Party of Trump. ” Hillary may prefer a Democratic Congress but she certainly isn’t willing to risk losing over it. There’s some evidence that voters see a difference between Donald Trump and other Republican officeholders. In six key states that have Senate races up as well, the Republican candidate for Senate is doing better than Trump. In fact, in only two of 53 polls was he not running behind the Republican Senate candidate. All of these polls are the same polls for both races none are older than July. The below chart shows the average by which the Senate candidates’ showing improves over Trump’s. Not all of these candidates are winning. And some of them may lose in November. But all are doing better than Trump, even the mediocre ones. There’s an especially notable difference among minorities. One poll that got attention in July showed Trump winning just 1 percent of black voters in Missouri, with Hillary getting 96 percent. That same poll showed the Senate incumbent, Republican Roy Blunt, losing blacks 77 percent to 7. 7 percent  —   not great, but within the normal range for Republicans and not dissimilar to the   showing. Undecideds may swing to the Democrat, but until they do, a   margin is actually a good sign. Geoffrey Skelley, of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, tweeted the following poll results on Democratic margins among Hispanics in six states for the presidential race and the Senate races from Latino Decisions. Maybe Marco Rubio in Florida and John McCain in Arizona had already expected to do well with this demographic. But take the example of North Carolina, where the incumbent is not particularly strong, or Nevada, where the Democrats are fielding a Hispanic candidate: There is still a very large difference between the Senate races and the presidential race. The one race that doesn’t show an improvement is Colorado, where the Republicans put up a very weak candidate for the Senate  —   and even there, he’s not doing worse. We have more data for Senate races than for other   races, but I think this evidence shows us that voters do separate between the nominee and other members of the party. Anecdotally, I’ve met many people who will not be voting for Trump but will vote for Republicans otherwise. Connie, from suburban Cleveland, tells me she’s “one of those   suburban women of whom you have heard,” who will be voting for Hillary but for Republicans for other offices. Her yard has signs for Republican senator Rob Portman and Marco Rubio (despite the fact that he’s not on her ballot) but also for Hillary Clinton. As this article from the Washington Post shows, she’s not alone. Another factor to consider is the apparent strength of the Libertarian party this year. Why is Gary Johnson doing so well after getting just 1 percent of the vote in 2012? Because the Republicans nominated Donald Trump. It’s the only answer Americans didn’t suddenly decide to become libertarian. Had the Republicans nominated a normal candidate, Johnson wouldn’t be doing as well and Mitt Romney would not be advocating his participation in the debates. Not only will we be seeing a lot of   voters, it seems we can also expect to see   votes. Rob Portman in Ohio and Florida’s Marco Rubio are perhaps the best examples of the   trend. Neither has gone out of his way to repudiate Donald Trump (although I wish they had). What they seem to have accomplished is getting Trump’s voters (for Rubio, the exact same people who dashed his presidential hopes back in March) while at the same time holding on to the center. Both also have special strengths with certain constituencies, Portman with unions and Rubio with Hispanics. Interestingly, Trump seems to be doing better in states that have strong Senate incumbents, like Florida, Iowa, and Ohio. It could be just happenstance, but a theory worth exploring is that voters in those states associate the Republican label with the local candidate, not with Trump. Call it a “reverse coattails” effect, if you will. This isn’t transferring 100 percent as we’ve seen above, Portman and Rubio are doing a lot better than Trump is in their states. Republicans shouldn’t be complacent about   races: The party brand is indeed tarnished. But there’s a lot of reason to believe that this year will see more ticket splitting than we’ve seen in a while. All of this, of course, assumes that Trump loses by a large margin. Hillary could still blow it. If she manages to lose, or if she wins only by a narrow margin, this whole discussion is probably moot  —   and even without ticket splitting, Republican losses can be contained.,"

","Political mildness is scarce nowadays, so it has been pleasantly surprising that   denunciations of the Electoral College have been tepid. This, even though the winner of the presidential election lost the popular vote by perhaps 2. 8 million votes, more than five times the 537, 179 votes by which Al Gore outpolled George W. Bush in 2000. In California, where Democrats effortlessly harvest 55 electoral votes (more than   of 270) this year’s presidential winner was never in doubt. There was no gubernatorial election to excite voters. And thanks to a “reform,” whereby the top two finishers in a   primary face off in the general election, the contest for the U. S. Senate seat was between two Democrats representing faintly variant flavors of liberalism. These factors depressed turnout in the state with   of the nation’s population. If there had been more excitement, increased turnout in this heavily Democratic state might have pushed Hillary Clinton’s nationwide   margin over 3 million. And this still would not really matter. In 1876, Rutherford B. Hayes won the electoral vote even though Samuel J. Tilden won 254, 694 more of the 8, 411, 618 popular votes cast. (With 51 percent, Tilden is the only presidential loser to win a majority of the popular vote.) In 1888, Benjamin Harrison won the electoral vote 233 —  168 even though President Grover Cleveland won the popular vote by 89, 293 out of 11, 395, 083 votes cast. In both years, however, exuberant fraud on both sides probably involved more votes than the victory margins. Those who demand direct popular election of the president should be advised that this is what we have  —   in 51 jurisdictions (the states and the District of Columbia). And the   system quarantines electoral disputes. Imagine the 1960 election under direct popular election: John Kennedy’s   margin over Richard Nixon was just 118, 574. If all 68, 838, 219 popular votes had been poured into a single national bucket, there would have been powerful incentives to challenge the results in many of the nation’s 170, 000 precincts. More Electoral CollegeAmerica’s CollegeWhat Trump calls Schumer, c. The Culinary CultFar from being an unchanged anachronism, frozen like a fly in   amber, the Electoral College has evolved, shaping and shaped by the party system. American majorities are not spontaneous growths, like dandelions. They are built by a   system that assembles them in accordance with the Electoral College’s distribution incentive for geographical breadth in a coalition of states. So, the Electoral College shapes the character of majorities by helping to generate those that are neither geographically nor ideologically narrow, and that depict, more than the popular vote does, national decisiveness. In 1912, Woodrow Wilson won just 41. 8 percent of the popular vote but conducted a strong presidency based on 81. 9 percent of the electoral votes. Eighty years later, Bill Clinton won 43 percent of the popular vote but 68. 8 percent of the electoral votes. In 2008, Barack Obama won 52. 9 percent of the popular vote but 67. 8 percent of the electoral vote. The 48 elections since 1824 have produced 18 presidents that received less than 50 percent of the popular vote. The greatest of them, Abraham Lincoln, received 39. 9 percent in 1860. So, on December 19, when the electors cast their votes in their respective states, actually making Donald Trump the   remember: Do not blame the excellent   system for the 2016 choice that was the result of other, and seriously defective, aspects of America’s political process.,"

","A presidential victory by a candidate you detest isn’t supposed to be the end of the world  —   or the end of your world. Yet since November, the panicked reaction from progressives seems to be intensifying instead of passing. Over at Out, an activist declares, “It’s the early days of AIDS all over again. ” Senator Bob Menendez describes “fear and panic in the immigrant community,” with those living in the country illegally selling off their possessions and preparing to move quickly. The Week asks whether Trump’s presidency will “quash scientific progress in America. ” Do these people need a hug, or to be vigorously shaken and told to snap out of it? They’re experiencing a colossal emotional transformation even though nothing has actually changed in their    lives. They are exactly the same people they were on November 8. Everything they had the day before  —   their smarts (or lack thereof) their work ethic, their skills, their passions, their vision  —   is still there. Trump’s election didn’t do anything to them. And yet they’re reacting to the election like they’ve been physically assaulted. These        souls’ sense of identity and   is obviously tied up with the success of the Democratic party, their partisan identification so psychologically intense that their physiological condition changes depending upon election outcomes. We don’t know precisely what the future holds, but history teaches us that Republican control of Washington will not last forever. The last three midterms have brought giant swings, as voters recoil from what they just endorsed two years earlier. Colossal defeats tend to motivate people. The early decisions of the Obama administration of 2009 provided the catalyst for the Tea Party movement a 2010 survey of Tea Party leaders found they were “driven by an overwhelming, often personal, feeling that future generations’   weighs on their shoulders. ” The early years of Obama stirred Republicans to seek office in 2010, the GOP had a candidate running in 430 districts, the most in 30 years. Democrats may not be able to win a comparable comeback in 2018, but their party and activists will have better days ahead. The speed of that recovery, however, will be partially dependent upon the Left’s ability to move on from its   malaise and focus on the fights to come. Treating every Trump decision as another sign of national and personal apocalypse is psychologically unhealthy and politically counterproductive.

","As brooding loner James Delaney in “Taboo,” British actor Tom Hardy cuts an enigmatic figure. In the premiere, Delaney barges into his father’s funeral, shocking all the mourners, including his   and    who thought he was dead. The sole beneficiary of his father’s estate, Delaney is in a position to bring the East India Company, which wants a piece of land in the Pacific Northwest owned by Delaney, to its knees. Before long, the handsome adventurer has no shortage of enemies  —   and a collection of people who have their hands out, claiming some connection to the late Delaney patriarch. In this week’s episode, the East India Company hierarchy makes good on its attempt to make Delaney’s life difficult. Hardy, 39, spoke to The Post about the genesis of the series and explained a few of its mysteries.  I wanted to honor period drama as part of the legacy of [Britain] in the arts. They’re important as entertainment. My father, Chips Hardy, and Steve Knight wrote this. I had a conversation about nine years ago with my father about a character I’d really like to play. The character came from me playing Bill Sikes [in a BBC production of “Oliver Twist” in 2007].  We don’t often see inside his head. Is he suffering from   stress and how does it manifest itself when you don’t have psychoanalysis? There’s also a tattoo on his back. A bird named Sankofa. He’s covered in marks from being in Africa that have yet to be explained.  Back in the day there were bastards born all the time. The boy, Robert, is a ward of the father, and Delaney is repaying his father’s debts. Robert will return in the story.  He can’t feel anything. He’s not trying to meet anyone. If there was a romance, how do you deal with someone who’s really damaged or sexualize him when somebody has been through the things he’s been through?  In a mollyhouse. It’s a drag place where Godfrey (Edward Hogg) is dressed as a woman. Of all the people he meets, Godfrey and James would seem to be the hot item.  Bow (Tracee Ellis Ross) convinces Dre (Anthony Anderson) to try therapy, and he learns how to cope with his anger issues. Meanwhile, Johan (Daveed Diggs) becomes a life coach to the kids.  Carrie (Claire Danes) is in the ’hood  —     to be exact  —   living in a brownstone and working at a foundation that helps Muslim Americans being profiled by the US government. Meanwhile, Quinn (Rupert Friend) is a patient at a very sketchy VA hospital. CIA vaudevillians Dar (F. Murray Abraham) and Saul (Mandy Patinkin) brief   Keane (Elizabeth Marvel) on national security matters.  You remember the 1988 blockbuster with Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey (and her lips). You remember “Wind Beneath My Wings,” the theme song that won a 1990 Grammy award for Song of the Year. Now is your chance to hear it again, as the chick flick has been remade for the small screen, with Broadway’s Idina Menzel taking the Midler role as an aspiring singer, and Nia Long playing the doomed friend, Hillary. Their relationship, even with its ups and downs, sustains them through life  —   and death.

","Disgusted Uber customers are deleting the   app in droves after learning that the company defied Saturday’s taxi strike at JFK Airport, which was aimed at protesting  . The New York Taxi Workers Alliance had asked drivers to protest Trump’s agenda  —   effectively a ban on Muslims entering the U. S. —   by not picking up fares at the airport Saturday night. Yet Uber continued to not only send its drivers  —   the company went so far as to even turn off its surge pricing in a sick attempt to drum up more business. “Taxis striking at JFK against Muslim ban. Uber, whose CEO advises Trump, breaking the strike, supporting the ban. Delete delete delete,’’   referencing Uber head honcho Travis Kalanick, who sits on Trump’s board. “Just deleted #uber. Going 2 be using #Lyft, since I like their integrity,”  . “If you take Trump’s money, u support the fascist pig. #deleteuber. ” A number of others on social media vowed to switch to Lyft, which donated $1 million to the ACLU on Sunday.   and director of House of Yes Kae Burke told The Post that she used to use Uber to transport her performers but deleted the app Sunday morning and will now use Lyft. “One of the strongest ways for us to be heard is with our dollars. We have to be very careful about where we spend our money,” Burke said. “The Uber people are watching. It’s going to hurt them, and they are going to regret it. ” While Uber directed its cars to the airport Saturday, CEO Kalanick sang a different tune on his Facebook page, acknowledging that a number of his drivers come from affected countries and “take long breaks to go back home to see their extended family. ” He added that the company is “working out a process to identify and compensate” drivers currently stuck outside the US and who may be unable to return due to the ban, in the hopes they can “help mitigate some of the financial stress and complications with supporting their families and putting food on the table. ” A spokesperson for Uber said Sunday that the whole thing was just a big misunderstanding. “We’re sorry for any confusion about our earlier tweet, it was not meant to break up any strike,” the rep said. “We wanted people to know they could use Uber to get to and from JFK at normal prices, especially tonight. ” By Sunday, the Taxi Workers Alliance had halted the ban on JFK   and were instead protesting in Battery Park, a rep said."

84979,127557,Why three (or more) parents leave the kids as losers,New York Post,Naomi Schaefer Riley,2017-03-20,2017.0,3.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170321005740/http://nypost.com/2017/03/20/why-three-or-more-parents-leave-the-kids-as-losers/
","If growing up with two parents is good for children, why not try three? That’s a question we might have to start asking after  to a Long Island couple and a neighbor with whom they were having a threesome. Dawn and Michael Marano married in 1994, but in 2001 they invited downstairs neighbor Audria Garcia to, well, join them. Since Dawn was infertile, the three decided that Michael would father a child with Audria but the three of them would raise the children together. Which worked out fine until Audria and Dawn decided they were happier as a twosome with the child, and left. Then Michael sued for custody. The judge decided that all three parents were raising their children “in a loving environment” and so granted Dawn Wednesday nights with the boy, as well as one week of vacation during the school year and two weeks in the summer. Audria has residential custody, and Michael gets the boy on the weekends. As polyamory becomes a more common type of arrangement, more such custody decisions may follow. And now it turns out that medical science seems to be pushing us in this direction. Last week, Newcastle University in England was granted permission by the British government to make a   baby using the DNA of two different women, effectively giving it three genetic parents. In Newcastle’s case, the procedure is intended to replace an egg’s defective DNA with healthy DNA from a female donor. Yet it’s easy to see why other parents might consider it. As more   couples use   fertilization to have children, it’s not uncommon to find that both parents want a genetic connection to the child  —   both for legal and emotional reasons. But before we head down this path, it might be useful to know what the effects are of multiple parents on children. There’s not a lot of research out there on these arrangements and what exists seems hopelessly naïve. When asked about polyamorous relationships, Maria   of Deakin University in Australia told the BBC that “most children are really happy growing up with lots of adults, in fact most kids love it. ” She gushes that “these children are more insightful and wise, and open to understanding diversity and many forms of religion and culture. ” Indeed, there are now clinical psychologists who are decrying “couples privilege”: the presumption that “socially sanctioned   relationships involving only two people are inherently more important, ‘real’ and valid than other types of intimate, romantic or sexual relationships. ” But “the more the merrier” theory of parenting hasn’t worked out so well in other contexts. “The research on step families  —   where you often have effectively three parents in a child’s life  —   is clear,” says Brad Wilcox, who leads the National Marriage Project. Kids in more complex families are more likely to struggle. When there are different adults coordinating with one another, there can be different discipline, schooling and general parenting philosophies involved. Wilcox explains: “The complexity of three parents in the mix seems to be suboptimal for kids. ” When children are caught in parents’ conflicts or they’re the subject of parents’ conflicts, they’re more likely to experience anxiety, behavior problems and difficulty in school. Robin Fretwell Wilson, who directs the Program in Family Law and Policy at the University of Illinois, agrees that the complexity of the arrangements is a problem. “Kids are not like a pizza you can slice up six different ways. ” She notes that custody arrangements between two people are difficult enough. “How will you do it with three and four?” Wilson, who was adopted as a child and is a divorced mother herself, has a unique perspective on the question of how many parents a child needs. She notes that in some ways these questions have been in the courts for years. Couples that use surrogates, for instance, often have a child with two genetic parents and one “birth” parent. States vary in terms of the rights they assign to each. In some states, the mother who gives birth to the child has precedence over the woman who gave the egg. In other states it’s the reverse. In California, it depends on “intention”: When the whole process started, whose child was this supposed to be? Which brings us back to Dawn and Michael and Audria, who very much intended to be raising children in a group marriage. Says Wilson, “If you start slicing a pizza three ways, the person who had half before now has less. ” You could say that a child’s love is not a fixed pie, but the hours in a day sure are: “It wildly complicates things to have another   or legal parent. If we go too far with this we are going to create administrative nightmare. ” While Wilson isn’t suggesting more restrictive laws  —   “we don’t tell people they can’t have three people living in their house”  —   she can’t help but notice that “at the back end when they don’t work out, the kids pay the price. ” For them, anyway, three is a crowd.

","The de Blasio administration won the right Friday to destroy personal documents submitted by hundreds of thousands of applicants for its municipal ID program. Staten Island Supreme Court Judge Philip Minardo rejected a lawsuit filed by two Republican Assembly members from Staten Island  —   Nicole Malliotakis and Ron Castorina Jr.  —   claiming that destruction of foreign passports and other documents in the IDNYC program would be a threat to national security. The lawsuit was filed after the city moved to delete the records  —   many submitted by undocumented immigrants  —   following the election of President Trump. “Much ado was made about the recent federal election of a Republican President with an immigration agenda and petitioners’ support of the President and the very public opposition of certain respondents. Notwithstanding these petitions, this Court cannot make new law based upon a political party’s agenda,” Minardo wrote. The judge stayed his ruling until April 17 to allow for an appeal. Malliotakis said the ruling raises “serious concerns” about the future of “government transparency and public safety. ” “What does it mean if a government entity is allowed to destroy documents that are   …     subject to [the Freedom of Information Law and] judicial inquiries, and could be used to aid law enforcement?” she said in a statement. “We intend to pursue further options to prevent the mayor’s irresponsible actions that put all New Yorkers at risk. ” The lawsuit only covers the program’s first two years since records from later years were no longer being retained. But information included on the application for the ID card  —   including an applicant’s name, address, borough of residence, gender, date of birth, email, eye color, height, signature, status as a veteran and emergency contact information  —   is being kept and would be subject to subpoena. The ID cards have been a major success, with more than a million distributed. Card holders not only offer government identification, but free admission to about three dozen museums and other cultural institututions."

","Undercover cops in Michigan are one step closer to losing immunity from prosecution for having sex with prostitutes they’re investigating. A bill that would repeal the exemption and subject police officers to charges for   crimes unanimously passed the state’s Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. Senate Bill No. 275 now heads to the full Senate for consideration,  . “This is as succinctly written as anyone could make it. It eliminates the opportunity for those in undercover law enforcement to engage in sexual intercourse with someone they’re investigating,” the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Judy Emmons,   told the newspaper. “We have the dubious distinction of being the last state in the nation to have this law in our books. ” Emmons said law enforcement are “certainly not trained” to use such tactics, but acknowledged that the exemption must end, particularly as lawmakers work to fight human trafficking statewide. Bridgette Carr, a law professor at the University of Michigan and founding director of the school’s Human Trafficking Clinic, said Michigan is the only state in the country to provide immunity from undercover cops who have sex with prostitutes during investigations. Local and state investigators have said the tactic is not employed by investigators, an assertion backed up by the committee’s chairman. “As a former sheriff, no   police department would ever allow this,” said Sen. Rick Jones,   Ledge. “This makes so much sense. ” But Carr   that it would be difficult to track the practice if indeed it was occurring  —   or how widespread the tactic was being utilized. “It would be really hard to keep track of because of the immunity for police,” Carr said. “Folks with a lot of power have this immunity, and they’re around people who are really vulnerable. I’ve been working for a number of years trying to get rid of this immunity. ” Carr said she had been unsuccessful for years to see the exemption removed until she began working with Rep. Gary Glenn,   who began   in the House of Representatives. That bill has not yet had a hearing in the House, the Detroit Free Press reports. Hawaii was the last state to rid its book of the exemption in 2014, according to the newspaper."
88891,132595,Famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright had a dark side,New York Post,Barbara Hoffman,2017-06-07,2017.0,6.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170608003301/http://nypost.com/2017/06/07/frank-lloyd-wright-was-a-house-builder-and-homewrecker/
","He was a narcissist and control freak, a spendthrift and adulterer who led a life marked by scandal, debt and even murder. Along the way, Frank Lloyd Wright designed the most innovative buildings of 20th Century America  —   or, as he’d tell you, the whole world. Open kitchens, central hearths, homes built over waterfalls: All flowed from his ability to dream in  . Nearly 60 years after the architect’s death at 91, in 1959, 400 of his works still stand, including the Guggenheim, that swirling,   museum in the middle of Manhattan. His notoriety and genius inspired countless biographies, several novels and, peripherally, a pop song: “So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright,” which Paul Simon wrote for his departing partner (and architecture major) Art Garfunkel. Now, 150 years after his June 8, 1867 birth, there’s “Frank Lloyd Wright at 150: Unpacking the Archives,” at the Museum of Modern Art. Opening June 12, it boasts 60 years of drawings, building fragments, textiles and TV clips, including a 1957 Mike Wallace interview that shows Wright as what MoMA curator Barry Bergdoll describes as “both a social progressive and incredible curmudgeon. Wright’s entire life was a study in extremes. A house builder and a home wrecker, he wore capes and lived large. As Ada Louise Huxtable wrote in 2004’s “Frank Lloyd Wright,” the architect had two lives, “the one he created and the one he lived. ” Both, she said, were “too melodramatic” to make up  —   and full of lies. Early on, Wright shaved two years off his age and changed his middle name from Lincoln to Lloyd, to honor his mother’s Welsh heritage. It was she  —   his musician father she abandoned soon after Frank’s birth  —   who pushed him toward architecture, filling his childhood room in Wisconsin with engravings of English cathedrals. Worried he was becoming effeminate, she sent him to her brothers’ farm to work the land and man up. Despite his mother’s fears, Wright was rarely without a woman. First wife Catherine was tall, rich and, when they met, 16 to his 20. Wed two years later, she gave him four sons and two daughters. Though he worked for one of Chicago’s top architectural firms, he spent lavishly, moonlighting to make ends meet. He filled one room of his home with chandeliers, an “Arabian Nights” mural and a balcony for theatricals. And that was just the playroom. But Wright wasn’t engineered for play or, it seems, fatherhood. In 1909, now working for himself, he left his projects, wife and kids and ran off with a client’s wife. Her name was Martha Cheney, but everyone knew her as Mamah. She left her own two children to be with the charismatic man she considered her soul mate. After meeting at the Plaza Hotel, they flew to Europe, where Wright worked on his portfolio while Mamah waited for her divorce to come through. But Catherine refused to divorce Wright, even after he and Mamah returned to America in 1911. The lovers settled in Taliesen, the rural, Spring Green, Wisconsin, retreat Wright had started to build on land close to his uncles’ farm. Taliesen, from the Welsh for “shining brow,” was one of the great loves of Wright’s life. One awful day in 1914, while Wright was in Chicago, Mamah and several workmen stayed behind. Her children were visiting, and houseman Julian Carleton had just served them lunch when he slipped outside and set the place on fire. As Mamah and the others tried to flee, Carleton hacked them to death. After the smoke cleared, Mamah, her children and four others lay dead. Their killer, whom Mamah reportedly had fired and was clearly deranged, died in jail soon after. In 1909, now working for himself, he left his projects, wife and kids and ran off with a client’s wife. Wright was distraught. Joined by his and Catherine’s    son, John, he filled Mamah’s casket with flowers he picked from her garden and buried her himself. He found relief only in rebuilding Taliesen and designing Tokyo’s Imperial Hotel, which would later secure his fame. He wasn’t single for long. A wealthy,   stalker named Miriam Noel sent him steamy sympathy notes, calling him “Lord of my Waking Dreams. ” Catherine finally granted him a divorce in 1922, and Wright and Noel wed the next year. It was a brief and brutal union, during which Noel contrived to have Wright charged with violating the Mann Act, for transporting a woman (herself) across state lines for “immoral purposes. ” Their divorce was still pending when Wright, then 57, met Wife No. 3. Olga Hinzenberg, whom Wright nicknamed Olgivanna, was a dancer follower of the mystic Georgi Gurdjieff. She was also nearly 32 years younger than Wright, married and a mother, but that didn’t stop her from bearing him a love child, Iovanna. In 1928, they wed and, four years later, hit on a genius way to pay the bills: by founding the Taliesen Fellowship, where for the next three decades, architect wannabes labored on Wright’s home for less than nothing. “They not only worked in the drawing room but farmed his crops, made his food, cleaned . . . and paid tuition for it,” Roger Friedland,   of 2006’s  told The Post. “It was brilliant, because Wright was broke,” after years of expensive living. Huxtable called it “a shameless scam, a form of indentured servitude. ” Because there were so many men and so few women at Taliesen, Friedland said, the Wrights dictated their workers’ sex lives, rotating the few women as needed. On the plus side, Friedland noted, many young gay men found the compound a safe space during homophobic times. All the while, Wright’s star continued to rise. When an earthquake toppled much of Tokyo in 1923, killing more than 100, 000, his Imperial Hotel remained standing. (It finally fell in 1967 to a wrecking ball.) Wright’s designs sometimes outstepped the technology needed to support them. Then again, he didn’t care if some of his buildings leaked. When someone complained that water was falling on his desk, Wright told him to move the desk. “He was constantly experimenting  —   with materials, with ways of assembly,” MoMA’s Bergdoll told The Post. “He wanted to push American technology faster than it was willing to go. ” And yes, Bergdoll continued, Wright was a “bundle of contradictions. ” While sifting through the archives, Bergdoll discovered that Wright designed a school for   children in the South, then boasted that he was “doing something for ‘darkies.’ ” Friedland said that while many of Wright’s clients were Jewish, he agreed with Charles Lindbergh that America’s entry into WWII “was engineered by the Jews. ” Then again, biographer Huxtable noted, he was an   basher: “[His] long list of fools and rogues made no distinctions of race or ethnicity. ” He could be scathing to rivals, living and dead. He called the architecture firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill “Skiddings,   and Sterile,” and suggested Le Corbusier make paintings, not buildings. A dandy who never passed a mirror he didn’t peer into, as biographer Meryle Secrest noted, Wright’s   was monumental. Look magazine reported that he once identified himself in court as “the world’s great living architect. ” When Olgivanna chided him for such immodesty, he replied, “You forget   …     I was under oath. ” In many ways, Bergdoll believes, Wright was a publicity hound who deserved to be famous: “Here’s someone who was inventing whole new systems of architecture in his 80s, who holds a press conference at 88 to propose [building] a   skyscraper. ” Wright never made his tower in the sky. Nor did he see the Guggenheim completed: He died three months before it opened, shortly before his 92nd birthday. Even then, he didn’t rest: After Olgivanna’s death, his body was removed from its resting place in Wisconsin and cremated, his ashes and hers scattered together in Arizona, where the couple had erected Taliesen West. It was their idea of heaven. “I believe in God,” Wright liked to say, “only I spell it Nature. ”"
88978,132693,Jim Comey’s real bottom line: He wants Trump prosecuted for firing him,New York Post,John Podhoretz,2017-06-08,2017.0,6.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170609015040/http://nypost.com/2017/06/08/jim-comeys-real-bottom-line-he-wants-trump-prosecuted-for-firing-him/
","James Comey thinks, but did not say, that President Trump is going to be toast once the special counsel is done with him  —   and all because of three little words Trump might have sung in the manner of Elsa the Ice Queen: “Let this go. ” Comey clearly intimated that Trump’s conduct toward him was an effort to obstruct justice    —   and that special counsel Robert Mueller would be just the guy to get to the bottom of what is clearly an impeachable offense. That was the key revelation of the former FBI director’s gripping Senate hearing Thursday. Comey said the president’s behavior at a February White House dinner  —   during which Trump cleared the room so he and Comey could have a private    about Flynn  —   had “stunned” him. That was when, according to the document he released Wednesday, Trump said to him, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. ” Comey said he believed this was intended as “direction” and he found it “a very disturbing thing, very concerning” the president would say such a thing. Republican Sen. Jim Risch sought to limit the damage from Comey’s words by pointing out that hoping for something would not be grounds for charging someone with a crime. Comey replied: “This is a president of the United States with me alone saying ‘I hope this.’ I took it as, this is what he wants me to do. ” Comey said that, “as an investigator” himself, “of significant fact to me is so why did he kick everybody out of the Oval Office? Why would you kick the attorney general, the vice president, the chief of staff out to talk to me?” This was a clear suggestion that Mueller, his fellow investigator, would likely see the same significance he did. Asked by Sen. Richard Burr if the president had sought to obstruct justice, Comey replied coyly, “I don’t think it’s for me to say . . . That’s a conclusion I’m sure the special counsel will work towards to try and understand what the intention was there, and whether that’s an offense. ” That “disturbing, concerning” thing is now Mueller’s bailiwick. Mueller, also a former director of the FBI, is, in Comey’s words, “a dogged, tough person and you can have high confidence when he’s done, he’s turned over all of the rocks. ” Translation for Trump:  . Now, Comey could be wrong. He’s been wrong before. He was wrong to give a press conference on July 5 last year that effectively indicted Hillary Clinton before announcing she wouldn’t be charged for mishandling classified information  —   a colossally unfair thing to do. And he was wrong to go public on October 28 about reopening the Hillary investigation, an irresponsible declaration that may have had a material effect on the presidential election. But in suggesting what a fellow investigator might find problematic in Trump’s behavior, Comey can probably be trusted. There was some good news for Trump: Comey’s testimony effectively ended the speculation that the president was personally under investigation of any sort for collusion with Russia in the 2016 election. On Wednesday, Comey acknowledged he had told Trump on three occasions the president wasn’t under counterintelligence investigation. After Comey released that written statement, Washington Talmudists read deeply into it to suggest Comey might have been signaling Trump was the subject of a different kind of investigation. Comey told both Sens. Marco Rubio and Susan Collins there was none. “Mr. Comey has now finally confirmed publicly what he repeatedly told the president privately,” said Trump lawyer Marc Kasowitz. “The president was not under investigation as part of any probe into Russian interference. He also admitted that there is no evidence that a single vote changed as a result of any Russian interference. ” The problem for Trump is that he’s under investigation now. And this investigation,   arose due to a strange   right after Comey’s firing about how “Comey better hope there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” This triggered Comey’s decision to release,   his own contemporaneous memo about the president’s effort to pressure him. As Continetti writes, “By firing Comey and then tweeting recklessly about it, Trump elevated a   but manageable problem  —   the   ‘Russia thing’  —   into an independent investigation that seriously endangers his presidency. ” Twitter giveth  —   and may taketh away. And all because Trump couldn’t let it go."

Between April 21, 2015, and Sept. 3, 2015  —   a span of 135 days  —   they debuted in the majors. Each has now been a key part of a playoff team at least once, and the Indians’ Francisco Lindor and Cubs’ Addison Russell are facing each other in the World Series. That duo, plus the Astros’ Carlos Correa and Dodgers’ Corey Seager, are linked by their position, youth and excellence. How young? They not only are the four youngest shortstops to qualify for the batting title in 2016, but four of the youngest six at any position to do so, with only Texas’ Nomar Mazara and Rougned Odor crashing the party. How excellent? Well, they already are cornerstones on championship contenders. Also, they have four of the 15 best Wins Above Replacements for shortstops through their   season in major league history, a list littered with Alex Rodriguez, Cal Ripken Jr. and Robin Yount. I    —   before any had made their debut  —   because so many in baseball were gushing about them. At that time, ESPN, Baseball America and Baseball Prospectus had the four among their nine best prospects. They have honored the forecast as the face of what is a young shortstop revolution in the majors that also includes Boston’s Xander Bogaerts, Atlanta’s Dansby Swanson and Colorado’s Trevor Story (Manny Machado would fall in this group if he played shortstop regularly). Because Lindor, Russell, Correa and Seager essentially matriculated together, they are a modern   Derek Jeter and Nomar Garciaparra. Who you got and why? I put that question to 13 executives, managers and scouts, asked them to rank the quartet in order and give reasons. The only universal outcome was that Russell finished fourth on each ballot, mainly because he is not viewed as a     hitter. But so many respondents echoed some form of, “I would happily take any of this group. ” The winner was Seager, who finished first or second on 12 of the 13 ballots and had the most   votes (8). Lindor had four, Correa one. Lindor was second (he also had six   votes compared with Correa’s three).

He was cited for lefty power and makeup, but there was come concern he is so big that he might have to eventually move to third base.

What was most often mentioned was his defensive genius and rising ability as a  .

The term most often repeated: “highest ceiling,” but there also was some worry that he was not as good this year as last. Lots of comps to Seager, but Seager got the edge for being lefty. An AL manager called Correa a “  talent if he can harness his ability. ” An NL scout: “He is   if it all comes together and stays together. ” A 2016   and Gold Glove finalist. An NL personnel head: “It is funny to put someone as good as Russell last on a list. ” NL scout: “He has tons of upside left.

Cops are hunting for William Smith, 53, who they also suspect in the   at a Manhattan shelter. Smith ditched his wallet and phone in the Lincoln Town Car in which hack Manuel Vera, 43, drove him to a Holiday Inn on Van Cleef Street in Corona shortly after midnight, cops said. Smith, hailed the cab at 103rd Street and Roosevelt Avenue. He told Vera to drive to the back of the hotel and then tried to rob him. When Vera resisted. Smith slashed him and ran off, cops said. “I was really scared. When he first stabbed me he wanted to keep going. I had to defend myself,” Vera told The Post, adding his attacker was “moving a lot” when he got in the town car and he couldn’t tell if he was intoxicated. “He told me he was going to pick up a woman,” Vera explained, but when they reached their destination, “He made it seem like he was reaching in his back pocket to get the money but instead he took out the knife. ” Vera, who took 10 stitches in his neck and 15 in his back, said the slasher didn’t steal any money but skipped out on the $10 fare for the   mile trip. After the attack, Vera took out his phone and called 911. Cops want to question Smith in the homicide of    Marcus Guerreio, who was found dead at the Bellevue Men’s Shelter on East 30th Street and First Avenue in Manhattan. Guerreio, who got around with a walker and hawked cigarettes to make a few bucks, was found dead in his bed at 8:25 a. m. Friday. He was surrounded by blood, and his neck was slit and wrapped in a thin wire. The walls in his   room were spattered with blood. M&M candies were scattered across the floor. said authorities. A bloody sheet and some clothing were found in a   bathroom trash can, cops said. “It looked like a horror movie up there,” said one shaken shelter resident, who claimed the disabled Guerreio also got robbed a week ago. Cops are trying to figure out if Guerreio was victimized in recent weeks. Police released a mug shot of Smith taken after a recent fare beating arrest f. He’s    160 pounds, with hazel eyes. Shelter resident Kevin Williams, 53, said that because he was disabled, Guerreio was an easy mark. “He sits in his walker and sells cigarettes   …     you’re pulling your money out. You got a lot of people here doing drugs. What do you think happens when they go broke? They know you’re disabled, you can’t defend yourself. “You don’t pull out your money in a place like this. ” About three hours after Vera was knifed, another man was slashed across the face early Saturday in a separate attack in Foxhurst, The Bronx. The man was slashed on Hoe Avenue near Aldus Street in Foxhurst at around 3:40 a. m. officials said He was taken to Lincoln Hospital with    injuries."

Steven Bauer, the man Esteban eventually became, remembers the trip as “an inconspicuous visit to my mom’s sister in Florida”  —   but, in reality, his family was defecting from Cuba following Fidel Castro’s takeover the year before. So began Bauer’s American odyssey, which took him to the University of Miami and Hollywood  —   and to “Ray Donovan. ” In between, he met and married actress Melanie Griffith and at age 25,   with Al Pacino in the 1983 cult film “Scarface. ” The world was his oyster. “Warren Beatty told me, ‘You could be the next me, the way you look and what your talent is,’ ” says Bauer. “‘Just know yourself. Don’t get sucked in. ’” Bauer, 59, did not turn out to be the next Beatty or the next Pacino. He admits he got sucked in, not fulfilling his early promise. “I wanted to start producing and directing films right away, but I was overwhelmed by life,” he says. “But I cleaned up my life from the vampires who know you’re an easy mark. “I’m not as pretty as I was, but I still got it. ” On “Ray Donovan,” Bauer plays Avi, a former Mossad soldier who serves as Ray’s (Liev Schreiber)   guy. If Ray needs to bury someone, Avi is there with a shovel. If Ray needs to make someone go away  —   perhaps permanently  —   Avi takes care of it. “I am a Israeli soldier in the USA working for a man who needs my special services,” Bauer says. “I do the things he’s not willing to do. I protect him at all costs. I love Ray. ” The actor, who took the name Bauer from his maternal   is equally in awe of Schreiber, watching him from the sidelines. “I know sometimes I come off as a young actor when I talk to him,” he says. “I’m really in awe of his dedication. I tell him and he’ll say, ‘Thanks, bubbe.’ He’s not everybody’s cup of tea and he doesn’t care. What he is is a great interpreter of drama. ” ‘I’m not as pretty as I was, but I still got it.’ This season, one of Bauer’s favorite scenes was actually with Devon Bagby, who plays Ray’s teenage son, Conor, whom Avi babysits. “Conor’s playing video games and it bothers Avi. He tells him, ‘You should read a book. You should do something that will stimulate your mind.’ ” Avi challenges him to a game. If Avi wins, Conor has to read “Jonathan Livingston Seagull. ” If he loses? “Conor says, ‘If I win, you have to teach me how to use a gun.’ He beats the s —  t out me with the video games. ” With his chiseled, brooding features, Bauer has long been cast in action and crime films, largely based on his role as Manny Ribera in “Scarface,” a movie he says was almost destroyed by critics. “It’s a perfect movie. I knew it then. Al [Pacino] knew it then. Now the rest of society has caught on. Unfortunately, the critics found it to be too violent and   …     for 10 years the film was invisible. But the rap culture started bringing it into the limelight. And now it is what it is. ” Thanks to “Ray” and a role on “Breaking Bad” as Mexican drug lord Don Eladio, Bauer is no longer invisible. He has weathered four marriages (two of them produced sons, Alexander, 30, with Griffith, and Dylan, 26, with second wife Ingrid Anderson) and looks back on them with abashed wistfulness. “I came to Hollywood and was thrown into a shark tank,” he says. “I had no idea what people wanted from me in relationships. I’m really fortunate that I survived, at the cost of a lot of money. ”"

D’Souza, who briefly served time in a community confinement center for a minor   violation in what he calls political payback for his hit documentary “2016: Obama’s America,” begins this film with a clunky     of his spell inside, during which he supposedly learned about murderous   schemes that led him to reflect on their similarities to Democratic policy. Later D’Souza pretends to sneak into a secret chamber of Democratic HQ to find a hidden portrait of racist Democrat Andrew Jackson, portrays Lyndon Johnson as a vicious opponent of blacks and says the petty thefts of radical organizer Saul Alinsky were the essence of Democratic ideology. D’Souza does a service in pointing out, for instance, that Hillary Clinton has praised Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger (who spoke to an approving Ku Klux Klan and called   citizens weeds who needed to be exterminated). But he ruins most of his best scenes with cinematic hyperbole: A piece on the racist progressivism of Woodrow Wilson, for instance, ends with a ghost KKK rider bursting off the screen at the infamous White House showing of “The Birth of a Nation” and chasing Wilson around. In positioning himself as the   Michael Moore, D’Souza has succeeded only too well."
92880,137993,This woman gets to eat ice cream for a (really good) living,New York Post,"Rebecca Sullivan, News.com.au",2016-05-23,2016.0,5.0,http://nypost.com/2016/05/23/this-woman-gets-to-eat-ice-cream-for-a-really-good-living/,"Asking a new acquaintance what they do for a living is usually the most boring way to start a conversation. But ask Alison Gray, Haagen Dazs’s “technical expert” and you’ll get a delightfully fascinating answer. “I usually just tell people that I make ice cream for a living,” she told News. com. au from Haagen Dazs’s main manufacturing plant in Arras, a northern region in France two hours drive from Paris. Gray, a food scientist, creates new ice cream flavours for the international brand. When she’s not dealing with ingredient suppliers or answering emails (“that’s the boring part”) she slips on her white lab coat, her “special factory shoes” a hairnet, hard hat and glasses, and experiments with new flavour combinations. The tubs of ice cream we buy from the supermarket are the result of extensive testing, tweaking, and yes, sampling, by Gray and her team. On an average day, they taste two or three different ice creams, or as many as 15 during a testing day. (For the record, she doesn’t get free tubs of ice cream. In the factory she can eat “as much as I like” and gets a big staff discount).   A post shared by   Ice Cream (@haagendazs_us) on  “We probably create around   samples before we decide on the final flavour. One hundred [samples] is pretty normal,” she said. “We make lots of samples because we have lots of ingredients to test. Then we start to narrow down the number of samples and the number of ingredients and we go back and forth with the supplier to   the flavour, or change it completely. ” Gray works with a consumer insights team to figure out what customers around the world like, and develops new products based on that information. For example, simple flavours like vanilla, strawberry, and green tea sell well in Asia, while for Europeans “it’s all about caramels and chocolate”.   A post shared by   Ice Cream (@haagendazs_us) on  Australians love sorbets and we gobbled down so much green tea ice cream at the recent Sydney and Melbourne Haagen Dazs   shops that the flavour sold out here. (Haagen Dazs ice cream isn’t sold in Australian supermarkets). One of Gray’s recent creations for the European market is a caramel ice cream made with a caramel biscuit called speculaas, which are to France and Belgium what Tim Tams and Milk Arrowroots are to Australia. “These little biscuits are very famous here because you get them served on a saucer with a cup of coffee. We wanted to develop a great speculaas ice cream, but we had to decide what the ice cream base flavour was going to be  —   would it be vanilla or caramel?” she said. “We tested a number of different bases before we decided on a caramel base, which contains real caramel made from milk. Then we have to decide how the biscuit pieces were going to be.   A post shared by   Ice Cream (@haagendazs_us) on  “We didn’t want a swirl, because we wanted the biscuit pieces to shine through as the hero. We have to decide how big they will be and if they’ll be crunchy or soft. It sounds simple  —   ‘mix some biscuits with ice cream’  —   but when you’re developing a product that you want to do well, it takes a long time. We decided on a mixture of very, very small biscuit pieces, plus larger pieces which have a special technology in them that keeps them crunchy. ” Not every ice cream Gray creates ends up on supermarket shelves. Flavours like chocolate and chilli, fennel and lemon and chocolate and pink peppercorn (a dried berry with a peppery flavour) never made it to commercial production. “These kinds of things are in development, but we never manage to launch them because they’re a bit niche,” she said. Others don’t get made simply because they just don’t taste good. “Some combinations of fruit, like watermelon and passionfruit, just don’t go well together. Passionfruit is quite acidic and it was too much for the watermelon. If you have something acidic you need something creamy,” she said. Haagen Dazs creates limited edition ranges with more experimental flavour combinations that might not be commercially successful, like apricot and lavender, and rose and lychee, which Gray hopes will become part of the core range.   A post shared by   Ice Cream (@haagendazs_us) on  “The rose and lychee has become one of my favourites. I’m going to be very sad if we don’t make it again. ” For those who think “tasting ice cream” is something anyone could do, Gray compares her job to that of a sommelier. “It’s like tasting wine, as opposed to just drinking wine,” she said. “I would call it mindful tasting. We really savour the flavour. “Also, we use all of our senses, especially smell, because the nose is really important when you’re tasting. When I eat ice cream I keep it in my mouth and breathe deeply from the nose, so that all the flavours are released. ” While eating ice cream everyday sounds heavenly, it doesn’t sound that healthy. But Gray says she doesn’t eat a lot of ice cream outside of work. “I might have ice cream for pleasure once or twice a week. But many people who work at the plant, they have ice cream every single day. They have very active jobs and they’re always on their feet, so it’s fine. I honestly don’t think it’s something you really get sick of. ”"

It’s one of the most notorious   scandals of the city school system: Teachers paid to do nothing for years on end, thanks to an arbitration system that drags out even    cases. In Sunday’s Post, Susan Edelman reported on three teachers “rubber marooned” for almost seven years now. While confined to menial   tasks, the three collect full pay (with one earning almost $100, 000) benefits and contractual raises. This, when the Department of Education and United Federation of Teachers swung a deal six years ago to supposedly end the abuses by speeding up arbitration. And when Edelman last year exposed the case of Edward Morrissey, a teacher accused of striking a student, it took the arbitrator more than four years to find him guilty  —   while the DOE claimed to be helpless. The DOE stonewalls all questions about the rubber rooms, which also hold teachers no school will hire after their old one is closed or downsized. But it admits that paying these “educators” who aren’t educating eats up $100 million a year  —   cash that’s not helping a single child. Fariña seems happy to let the waste continue  —   she hasn’t even pushed for changes to the arbitration system. When the Legislature takes a fresh look at Mayor Bill de Blasio’s rule of the schools next year, maybe some lawmaker will ask why."

The   department store is quietly dumping the designer’s handbags in more than half of its 121   stores across the country, according to a research report on Tuesday. Nordstrom is also feeling squeezed by rival Macy’s, which has a glut of Kors bags, many of them on sale, the report from Wedbush Securities said. The markdowns are forcing Nordstrom to match the discount. “The incessant price matching that was necessary to keep up with Macy’s promotions” is a major reason Nordstrom is scaling back Kors bags, according to Lupine Skelly, who runs the retail checking group at Wedbush. Nordstrom, in a statement, insisted that it’s not discontinuing its “significant” relationship with Kors. A spokesman, though, declined to comment on the report’s assertion that some 54 stores had stopped carrying the bags in May and that another six might do so by June. Michael Kors declined to comment.

The best and worst April Fools’ Day stories,Guardian,Kevin Rawlinson,2017-04-01,2017.0,4.0,https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2017/apr/01/fake-news-the-best-and-worst-april-fools-day-stories,"“ ” and “fake news” have been etched, perhaps indelibly, on the public’s consciousness in recent months each of them having been named phrases of the year by different dictionaries. Among the most memorable were the claims that we send £350m per week to the EU, printed on the side of the Brexiters battle bus, and Donald Trump’s inflation of his inauguration crowds. By lunchtime on Saturday, a dozen or so more could be added to the list as newspapers and press officers continued the   (tired?) tradition of April Fools’ Day stories. Here are some of the best:  The paper reports that the professional   George Osborne is launching his own clothing line. The MP, newspaper editor,   speaker, chairman, hedge fund adviser and thinktank fellow is known to favour   jackets and hard hats. “Science correspondent” Rollo Piaf (no prizes for unscrambling the anagram) reports that a polar bear is living on a Hebridean island, having been “forced to head south after finding itself stranded on a melting sheet of ice that broke away from the Arctic ice cap”. “Harry’s secret wedding” screams the Mail across pages six and seven. The prince and Meghan Markle have eloped, the paper reports, but the fact that it is tucked away inside rather than on the front page may arouse suspicion among the Mail’s more discerning readers. The rather paunchy Harry    and bride’s   veil may also give the game away.  Horses in the Grand National will be allowed to wear headphones so they can listen to music, the Mirror reports   in a story “confirmed” by the music streaming firm Deezer’s spokeswoman, Avril Foal (top marks there). In today’s       April fool news, the Express reports that a pizza firm is planning to introduce a new heated letterbox that will keep food hot for up to 12 hours. Those who follow the instruction to turn to page 35, however, are dealt a bitter blow. Meanwhile, never one to miss a chance of some free publicity, PRs across the land have been beavering away for weeks on their April fool press releases in the hope of a few column inches. Here are some of the  : Virgin Atlantic: the airline reveals the Dreambird 1417, which boasts wings that bend and flex to create a flapping motion that not only propels the aircraft forward but generates its own power to meet every electronic need on board. To be fair, they have made a well produced and quite convincing video to accompany the     press release  —   complete with an appearance by Beardy himself. Virgin pride themselves on April fool releases, and Atlantic is just one of many flooding into reporters’ inboxes from Branson’s subsidiaries.  Marmite: the makers of Britain’s most      spread announce the launch of    —   a blander version of the yeasty   designed to prove breakfast needn’t be divisive.  Paddy Power: seahorse racing. That’s right, seahorse racing. “It’s one of those ideas that’ll sink or swim but we’re delighted to be the first sponsor to take the plunge. The little blighters are tough to train and their tiny saddles keeping falling off but I reckon we’ve backed a winner,” a spokesman says. “Despite initial challenges with training we’ve found them to be one of the most competitive species on the planet,” adds Stephen McMeel, new product researcher at the bookmaker.  Paddy Power have also made a video, of course. Chill Factore: the UK’s “longest indoor real snow slope” in Trafford, announces a new snowboarding school for dogs  —   “proving that you can teach an old dog new tricks”. Its PR agency has also gone to the trouble of making a video, which was definitely worth the effort (71 views so far. ..). The Beano: the tweet says it all.  : while the “launch” of a helium variant of the soft drink is not going to fool too many people, full marks for the quote from Kate Miller, its UK marketing manager.  She says: “We’re delighted to be launching   Helium this year  —   it really inflates our range of drinks and lifts our fans’ spirits. Popularity of   continues to balloon and this new variant is set to be a flyaway success. ” Virgin Trains: not to be outdone by their airborne colleagues, the rail operator announces the launch of an “innovative new contactless ticket system”       that lets customers have their season tickets tattooed on their body. John Sullivan of Virgin Trains says: “We wanted to provide people with a clever way of always having their ticket on them. What better way than to have it permanently tattooed on their body?” See? Branson loves 1 April.

100532,148054,"Women will march against Trump. We may lose, but it’s still worth it",Guardian,Suzanne Moore,2017-01-20,2017.0,1.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/20/trump-womens-march-london-protest,"Women, know your limits. Thou shalt not halt the rhetoric of misogyny legitimised by the rise of Donald Trump by taking to the streets on your silly Women’s March. No, stay indoors! Just soak up this wave of misogyny because everything is lost and protests never ever work and face facts: one of the problems with this Women’s March (though everyone is welcome) is that it contains way too many women. That’s bound to alienate certain guys   …     I have seen such views propagated on social media. Basically, women such as me organising, resisting, coming together just for a few hours in many cities around the world to make themselves visible is somehow not the right sort of opposition to Trump. We have been patronisingly told that the Women’s March will make things even worse. For whom, one has to ask? We have also been told that now is not the time. I agree: we should have done this long, long ago. We could have read the runes feminism has been demonised by the right as responsible for everything from unemployment to domestic violence for some time. Such a narrative is now mainstream, and we see to what and where it leads. This march, though, initially arose out of the fear and frustration of a grandmother in Hawaii. Her Facebook group led to the setting up of the march in Washington. Sister marches were soon announced in many cities across the globe. People, some of them women, clearly felt the need to organise, to mark what is happening and to make our voices heard. That is fairly simple. For some of us it is about showing international solidarity. But I don’t pretend protest is ever simple. There are always tensions. It is both an   protest and a rally for women’s rights. These two things are intimately connected: Trump is part of a backlash against feminism that has been a long time brewing. Trump has no subtext. His hatred of women is overt. Women are property or ornament. This is not hidden his appointments include those who want to roll back reproductive rights for the women who need them the most. His promise is about unabashed white power. His victory is a victory for overt racism as well as overt sexism. I wonder if those telling women not to march would tell people of colour not to protest? The criticism that the goals of the march are too vague has some validity, though actually the organisers in Washington have thrashed out a series of goals that try to take into account the complicated meshings of race and gender. This is not easy. Nor new. There will be those in the march in London who are uncomfortable with some of the others on it. There are groups supporting this march whose politics are very far from mine, but I will have to get over myself. So will everyone else. I have seen women complain that the march is too feminist or not feminist enough. Others have said that it’s pointless as we won’t bring down Trump. D’oh! Those who stir themselves, mainly on social media, to protest against the protest may think they are being iconoclastic but they are merely expressing their powerlessness. If voting doesn’t work and protest is useless, what exactly is the answer? Surely it lies in the relationship between the two, and that involves ongoing organisation. Any activist worth their salt knows that’s what the real work is. But protest is also a way to bring on the next generation, to connect, to mourn and then to find some optimism about where we are at right now. Out of fuzzy goals and all the different views there will be a pulling into focus. Sure, I remember the   marches with their clear and obvious objectives, but I also remember Greenham Common and the miners’ strike, which we lost. In both victory and loss however, understanding the power of defiance and collectivity is something to experience. Yes, that is   that feeling of solidarity, of walking beside others. The unfurling of banners and daft placards, the aching feet and children in pushchairs, the forging of bonds and the actual fun of protest. Some people will be there to make themselves feel better as well as make the world a better place. That’s how it works. One of today’s goals is surely to energise and connect women, to say to those who feel under attack: we are here too. You go on ahead. We have got your back. All of us have seen the disconnection of many from any kind of politics and also the disconnection between social movements such as Occupy from electoral politics. The prize is now to connect. Those who would take away women’s rights have already mobilised their anger and frustration and many have been slow to realise it. We now have to do the same thing. We will be seen and heard."

Norma McCorvey is the real name of the woman known as “Jane Roe” in the landmark US supreme court case on abortion rights, Roe v Wade. The 1973 case established a right for US women to have abortions. McCorvey became the plaintiff after she met with two lawyers looking for a test case to challenge Texas’s abortion ban. That was in 1970. At the time, McCorvey was pregnant, unwed, unemployed and unable to obtain an abortion legally or otherwise. McCorvey never had an abortion. Her case, which proceeded largely without her involvement, took too long to resolve, and she gave birth to a child that she placed for adoption. Several years after the ruling, she publicly revealed her identity and became involved in the   rights movement. But after a conversion to Christianity, she became an   rights activist. Before she died last week, McCorvey had said that it was her wish to see Roe v Wade overturned in her lifetime. Is Roe v Wade actually in danger? It depends on what you mean. Many legal experts are sceptical that the US supreme court would overturn it any time soon. For starters, it’s difficult to bring a case before the supreme court that would threaten the ruling, because those cases almost always founder in a lower court. And even if Donald Trump’s supreme court nominee opposes abortion rights, the current makeup of the court is such that there aren’t enough votes to overturn Roe. An alternative strategy is to poke so many holes in Roe that its protections for abortion rights become weakened. At this,   activists have been very successful. Since Roe, some states have enacted laws requiring women seeking an abortion to attend   counselling or to wait 24 hours or more for the procedure, laws extensively regulating abortion after 20 weeks, and laws blocking public funding for abortion. And they have picked up speed in recent years. Since 2010, lawmakers have placed 338 new restrictions on abortion. Will states continue to pass new   laws? Many states are controlled by Republicans who oppose abortion rights, so they will certainly try. You might have heard about a proposal in the state of Oklahoma calling for women to require permission for an abortion from the man who impregnated her. One legislator justified the bill by saying pregnant women’s bodies are not their own because they’re “hosts”. It’s outrageous, but not a huge threat to abortion rights  —   the jurisprudence is pretty clear that you can’t require an adult woman to get permission before having an abortion. What does threaten abortion rights are laws that chip away at Roe v Wade. Several states are attempting to ban a common method of   abortion on the basis that it’s cruel to the foetus. There are efforts to regulate how abortion clinics dispose of medical waste, which the clinics say are just attempts to shut them down with unnecessary rules and expenses. There is also a push to give women scientifically untrue information that it is possible to “reverse” an abortion performed with medication. Have all these laws really made it harder to get an abortion? It’s hard to say. There is evidence that shutting down clinics can cause a drop in the abortion rate. In Texas, after a 2013 clinic regulation forced about 20 clinics to close, there was a 50% drop in abortions in areas where the distance to the nearest clinics suddenly increased by more than 100 miles. Last June, the US supreme court ruled that the regulation had no medical justification and was unconstitutional. But in many places, the damage had already been done. Making it harder for women to pay for abortions also seems to have an impact. Since 1976, when Congress blocked Medicaid  —   insurance for those on    —   from paying for abortions, more than a million women have been blocked from access. A new tactic is to try to ban abortion coverage in state insurance marketplaces. Congress is exploring ways to replicate those restrictions nationally. Then there are laws that place extra restrictions on abortion  —   a waiting period, or a counselling requirement, or a ban on abortion after a certain number of weeks. The research isn’t definitive, but people who study abortion restrictions are pretty sure that these kinds of laws don’t prevent women from having abortions  —   they just make it more   and expensive. The exception may be bans on abortion after a certain week of pregnancy, which studies show can force women to carry a pregnancy to term. What could change under Trump? Republicans in Congress have plans to pass a national ban on abortion after 20 weeks, to make it harder for a future Congress to restore public funding for abortion, and to curtail insurance coverage for abortion. It’s not clear if they will overcome opposition in the Senate, where Democrats retain enough votes to filibuster legislation. But many public health advocates fear that the Trump administration will scale back the availability of contraception  —   which seems to have helped bring the US abortion rate to historic lows. Obamacare requires insurance companies to cover contraception with no copay, and the share of privately insured women who were able to obtain contraception at no extra cost quadrupled. Trump and Congress intend to repeal Obamacare  —   and so far, none of the replacement models have the same coverage requirements. At the same time, Republicans are attempting to strip public funding from Planned Parenthood, a move that health experts warn could blow a hole in the   public safety net."
103156,151524,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story review – a sleek addition to the fleet,Guardian,Peter Bradshaw,2016-12-15,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/13/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-review-felicity-jones-gareth-edwards,"This latest exhilarating,   and enjoyable adventure from the Star Wars imaginary universe is written by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy, and directed by Britain’s Gareth Edwards it comes from a time which now doesn’t seem so very long ago. The film’s action occurs some time between Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and Episode IV, A New Hope. So it’s a   or a deja  . Character archetypes, mythic confrontations, desperate hologram messages, dads real and   uniforms and hairstyles are always rising recognisably to the surface. Like superhero films or westerns or romcoms, Star Wars invented its own recurring generic components, and to complain or even notice now seems almost as beside the point as recognising familiar chord progressions in the blues. It is noticeable that the newish motif of the defector or renegade, which featured in The Force Awakens, pops up again here. Rogue One has a kind of associate membership status with the projected   club it doesn’t count as a fully fledged episode, but an auxiliary story, an offshoot of the canon, a sleek fighter cruising alongside the main fleet  —   though of comparable size, shape and manoeuvrability. Felicity Jones plays Jyn Erso, a courageous, fugitive rebel who happens to be the daughter of Galen Erso, the brilliant scientist, designer and Oppenheimer figure behind plans for the Empire’s terrifying new weapon, called a “Death Star”: he is played by Mads Mikkelsen with his familiar air of martyred machismo. Daughter and father endured a terrible trauma Jyn is close to the extremist   Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) and Galen finds himself working for the Empire’s chillingly fanatical administrator, Krennic  —   a pleasingly unpleasant performance, facially tense and clipped, from Ben Mendelsohn. But whose side is Galen actually on? And when Jyn finds herself destined to steal the Death Star plans and command a rebel ship   Rogue One, she must team up with another insurgent, Cassian Andor, played by Diego Luna, whose own hidden agenda she realises when it’s almost too late. Felicity Jones is in the    tradition of Star Wars female leads, like Carrie Fisher or Daisy Ridley:   but determined, with a sense of purpose befitting an heiress, if not a princess. The comedy robot this time around is   a reprogrammed Empire droid, voiced by Alan Tudyk, who is less obviously dapper than  .   is hulking and dark, more like Ted Hughes’s Iron Man in miniature, but with a droll way of objecting to orders his style in backtalk involves a nicely timed deferred punchline. The arms are long, resulting in an almost   simian way of walking. In his taciturn way,   could almost be a   presence. Elsewhere in the cast, there are signs that, whatever xenophobes like Donald Trump think, China is making a valuable contribution. Other fellow travellers in the rebel world include Baze Malbus, played by Jiang Wen, and Chirrut Imwe, played by Donnie Yen, who brings a martial artist’s poise to this blind figure who uses his   hearing and sense of the Force to negotiate his way around. Rogue One doesn’t really go rogue at any stage, and it isn’t a pop culture event like The Force Awakens, in whose slipstream this appears part of its charm resides in the eerie, almost dreamlike effect of continually producing familiar elements, reshuffled and reconfigured, a reaching back to the past and hinting at a preordained future. There are some truly spectacular cameos from   personae, involving   digital effects  —   almost creepily exact, so that watching feels at various stages like going into a time machine, back to the 80s and 70s. If there is anything new in Rogue One, it is that there is much more of an emphasis on the Death Star’s nuclear effect. In other films, we’ve seen this weapon blow up planets, and the calamity was almost abstract now a prototype is blowing up cities. The implied comparison arguably makes light of a serious subject, but there is a   fervency with which Rogue One deploys this catastrophe, and portrays the sacrifice needed to prevent it. Its variations on a theme are muscular and adroit. This is another really entertaining fantasy with   energy and attack."
103714,152259,Italy earthquake: residents fear historic towns will never look the same,Guardian,Stephanie Kirchgaessner,2016-10-31,2016.0,10.0,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/31/italy-earthquake-residents-historic-towns-rebuild-umbria-marche,"The earth has not yet finished shaking, but 24 hours after a 6.  earthquake reduced historic towns and villages in the Apennine mountains to rubble, the focus of residents and political leaders has already turned to the huge rebuilding task ahead. Authorities are dealing with both the immediate crisis of rehoming the 15, 000 people displaced by the series of earthquakes, and   questions about the kinds of homes suitable for an area at risk of future tremors. Not least of these questions is who will pay for them. “Give us back our tents” has become the unofficial mantra of some residents in the town of Norcia. They are refusing to leave their damaged homes, despite falling temperatures. “They’re not just tents,” one resident, Adolfo, told La Repubblica. “They’re comfortable and heated. [They] allow us to remain here to be able to confront the difficulties of this hour. ” Italy’s civil protection agency said it was moving about 500 people into hotels near Lake Trasimeno in Umbria and more than 4, 000 into hotels on the Adriatic coast an additional 3, 000 are staying in reception centres in Umbria and Marche. In Rome  —   where a major bridge, Ponte Mazzini near Trastevere, was closed to cars and pedestrians on Monday after the discovery of a crack caused by the earthquake  —   the prime minister, Matteo Renzi, dismissed the idea that residents could stay in tents given the approaching winter. “There are hotels for everyone,” he wrote in his weekly newsletter. “But many of our compatriots do not want to leave their areas, not even for a few weeks. So we’ll have to manage this initial emergency phase in the best way possible. ” Renzi is due to convene a cabinet meeting on Monday evening to discuss rebuilding efforts. For people in the   areas of Umbria, Marche, and parts of rural Lazio  —   where the town of Amatrice was levelled by an earthquake in August  —   Monday was the beginning of what is likely to be a long and contentious struggle to rebuild towns and villages without damaging their cultural heritage.  The rural regions are famous not only for their food but for the ancient stone used to build walls and homes the material has not proved to be as resilient as wood or other materials used in other   areas. For the first step of the rebuilding, the Italian civil protection agency will decide whether the homes left standing are safe enough to be  .  Cecilia Anesi, an investigative journalist who lives in Umbria and witnessed the devastating quake of 1997, said the next big question would be whether the government would seek to rebuild homes in wood and concrete, or whether it would maintain the region’s style and heritage. “The consequence of rebuilding everything in a modern way, using wood or concrete, means we won’t have historical centres any more, which are the soul of Umbria and Marche. It’s a very confusing moment,” she said.  “The government could rebuild houses in the ancient style by securing them with concrete, but it is very costly. The decision seems to be between quickly creating new homes, or saving heritage and with heritage, cultural identity. ” Anesi said historic churches needed to be protected and reinforced, because they were were often the first structures to fail in earthquakes. Paolo Bazzurro, professor of hazard and risk assessment at the University Institute for Superior Studies (IUSS) in Pavia, said he did not believe residents would consider rebuilding homes in wood to be an acceptable solution, even though they would be safer. “We are talking about people who have been living in small villages their entire life, so they want something that looks like the village they had. Rebuilding something that can be accepted is a big social sciences problem,” Bazzurro said. Despite promises by Renzi on Sunday of a total rebuilding programme, many residents may look to the experience of towns such as L’Aquila, which was devastated by an earthquake in 2009, and conclude that vast areas of the region may never be rebuilt. Seven years after the deadly quake, much of L’Aquila looks like a construction site deserted streets are still cordoned off to pedestrians. Mariagrazia Benvenuti, who has a home in the village of Sellano, knows from   experience how long it can take to rebuild in the area. She is still waiting for her home to be reconstructed, 19 years after the area sustained major earthquake.  She blames incompetence and official inaction. “There are buildings that have been crumbling for years, for which the municipality is uninterested despite the demands of citizens,” she said."
104018,152650,Iraq’s parliament passes law banning alcohol,Guardian,,2016-10-23,2016.0,10.0,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/23/iraqs-parliament-passes-law-banning-alcohol,"Iraq’s parliament has passed a law forbidding the import, production or selling of alcoholic beverages in a surprise move that angered many in the country’s Christian community who rely on the business. The law, passed late on Saturday night, imposes a fine of up to 25m Iraqi dinars (£17, 000) for anyone violating the ban. But it’s unclear how strictly the law would be enforced, and it could be struck down by the supreme court. Islam forbids the consumption of alcohol, but it has always been available in Iraq’s larger cities, mainly from shops run by Christians. Those shops are currently closed because of the Shia holy month of Muharram. Iraq’s parliament is dominated by Shia Islamist parties. The assembly announced the ban on its website but did not say how many lawmakers voted for or against it. Christian lawmaker Joseph Slaiwa said the “unjust” ban was slipped into a draft law regulating the income of municipal authorities without lawmakers being notified. The original article only called for imposing taxes on liquor stores and restaurants serving liquor, he said. “This ban is unconstitutional, as the constitution acknowledges the rights of   minorities and ethnic groups who live alongside Muslims in Iraq,” he said. “To those Muslim lawmakers, I say: ‘Take care of your religion and leave ours for us, we know how to deal with it’. ” He said some lawmakers will submit an appeal at the high federal court. The bill was proposed by Mahmoud   a judge and lawmaker from the State of Law coalition, the largest bloc in parliament. He insisted it was inkeeping with article 2 in the constitution, which prohibits any legislation that goes against Islam. “The constitution preserves democracy and the rights of   groups, but these rights must not violate the religion of Islam,” he said. “Some of the lawmakers’ vote was religiously motivated, but many others voted to avoid anything unconstitutional. ” Kirk Sowell, the publisher of the biweekly newsletter Inside Iraqi Politics, said the bill was clearly supported by Shia Islamists but came “as a bit of a surprise because it has not been a subject of major debate or discussion”. He said the executive branch could move to have the law overturned on procedural or other grounds, and the supreme court could strike it down. Other   countries have laws restricting alcohol, but only a few, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, enforce a complete ban. The Iraqi law was unlikely to be enforced in the largely autonomous Kurdish region, which is home to a sizeable Christian community. The bill comes as Iraq is waging a massive military operation to retake the northern city of Mosul from the Islamic State group. Isis brutally enforces a ban on alcohol, cigarettes and other drugs in the territory under its control. Iraqis debated the alcohol ban on social media, with many criticising lawmakers for ignoring more pressing concerns, such as the war against Isis, an economic crisis brought on by low oil prices, and the government’s own corruption and paralysis. A cartoon circulated online showing men with their backs turned on Mosul, shooting a bottle of liquor. Others expressed support for the ban and praised parliament for aligning the country’s laws with Islamic teachings."
105294,155542,Monty Python star’s illness ‘sparked huge interest in dementia’,Guardian,Alice Ross,2016-12-27,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/27/monty-python-terry-jones-illness-dementia-michael-palin,"The news this autumn that the former Monty Python actor Terry Jones is suffering from dementia prompted an extraordinary outpouring of support and interest in the illness, his colleague Michael Palin has said.  “The response was not just great sympathy for Terry and his family, but great interest in dementia,” Palin said. “So many people from all over the world saying my mother, my grandmother, my sister, my aunt, we’ve all suffered from this so what can we learn from this. That really surprised me and everyone I know. ” Palin was interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, along with Michael Parkinson, by the actor Carey Mulligan, who   Tuesday’s edition and focused on dementia, because her grandmother Nancy is also affected. Jones’s illness, which was diagnosed as primary progressive aphasia, had been known to friends and family for some time before it was announced to the public in September, Palin said.  During the last Monty Python live shows at the O2 in London in 2014, Jones had to use an autocue for some sections, such as the Four Yorkshiremen sketch, although for other parts, such as the Penguin on the TV sketch, he was still   Palin said. The disease is taking away Jones’s ability to communicate, Palin said. “For someone who was so articulate, who loved words and jokes and all that sort of thing, to be deprived of speech, it’s a terrible thing to happen,” he said. “But I feel, well, Terry’s still there  —   you can’t say because he can’t speak, he can’t feel things, and in fact when I’m with Terry there’s an emotional response. He recognises me and gives me a hug . .. We see him noticing things. ” Jones remains capable of surprising people, Palin said, describing having lunch with him and friends at the pub. “He doesn’t say very much until it comes to ordering the wine, when some really fluent Portuguese or whatever comes out,” he said.  Jones, 74, directed the Monty Python films The Life of Brian and Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life, and   Monty Python and the Holy Grail with Terry Gilliam. After Jones’s dementia was announced, Palin wrote on Facebook that the impact of the disease on his friend and colleague of more than 50 years had been “painful to watch”.  Parkinson told Mulligan about his mother’s experiences of the disease and how music could comfort her. During one visit, he took her to his car and put on a Frank Sinatra CD. “She sang every lyric  —   every single one. She didn’t know who I was, but she knew who Sinatra was,” he said. Jones enjoys watching musicals from the 1920s and 1930s, Palin said. “It’s music and it’s kind of nostalgia and he loves watching those: he will watch them time and again and I just find it incredibly touching. ” They discussed the challenges dementia poses for friends and family in continuing to relate to the person with the illness. “It’s very, very hard, I think, to know exactly how to be with them and how to relax with them,” Palin said. “I think he [Jones] likes having people there, but if nothing comes back it’s quite difficult and I can see people saying, ‘Oh well, I’ve done my bit, that’s it, I’m going off. ’” Parkinson said: “There’s a tendency for some people to say, if she doesn’t recognise me then as far as I’m concerned they are dead . .. That does happen. I just hope to god when that happens to you, you don’t feel that kind of rejection. ”"
105796,156237,Simone Biles and her team-mates are the Olympics #BlackGirlMagic we need now,Guardian,Carol H Hood,2016-08-09,2016.0,8.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/simone-biles-blackgirlmagic-rio-olympics-2016,"A week before the Olympics  —   before the US women’s team were the toast of the globe after winning the gold Tuesday evening  —   my niece decided that I needed to watch her perform gymnastics. She bounced into splits and pulled herself up, James Brown style. Her second trick of the afternoon involved a handstand into backbend, and for her final performance, she threatened to do a flip, but was promptly stopped by my mother, who vied to save all her art pieces surrounding us. I tried to redirect my niece’s energy. “Have you seen the US Olympic girls’ team?” I asked. I pulled out my smartphone, excited to bestow on her Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, all three of whom have   (Douglas and Biles identify as African American, and Hernandez is Puerto Rican). But my little niece merely shrugged and said, “I’ve seen them. ” When I was my niece’s age, the Olympics showcased many great black female athletes, but we didn’t have the luxury of taking them for granted. Some were victorious, like   who smashed records with her ratchet nails popping and   hair flying in the wind. Some endured an uphill battle like Surya Bonaly, whose very existence challenged European   standards with her strong build and her monstrous,     that even the men couldn’t do.  Then there was Olympic gymnast Dominique Dawes, who appeared on the gymnastics scene in Barcelona with such confidence one would have thought she’d always been there. I remember being in awe of her. Two years later, in 1996, Dawes, part of the “magnificent seven” would win the gold. But she was the exception to my mind rather than the rule. She still is. Today, most depictions of black bodies on TV aren’t there because they’re being feted, but because they’re being mourned. The most heartbreaking is the onslaught of viral videos and news stories carrying death via police brutality. I’ve cried many tears over the last two years, wondering what it takes for black women like me to be valued and loved by anyone. Our athletes continue to shoulder the burden of change for us, existing loudly, gloriously, in spaces from which women of color were historically excluded. That is the epitome of the US women’s gymnastics team, as it burns so brightly with #BlackGirlMagic. Douglas had already made history in London as the first black American to win the individual   and the first American gymnast to win gold in both the individual   and team competitions at the same Olympics. Laurie Hernandez made her mark had the internet dancing to her savvy floor routines. And Simone Biles has only made her Olympic debut, but did so as the first black American to be world   champion and the first woman of any race to win three consecutive world   titles. And she nailed the Olympics, too, helping lead her team to victory in team gymnastics in Rio. For many of us, these three young women  —   more than half the team  —   serve as a   reminder of what women of color can do. We have the ability to shape cultures, impact societies and excel against all institutional odds. This is what my niece is used to seeing. She isn’t like me. She doesn’t yet know what the USA looks like without the Obamas. She doesn’t yet know that her mother’s vigilance to keep her hair natural comes from a cultural movement of   and care, and not just a state of birth.  And she certainly does not yet know a US women’s Olympic gymnastics team without Gabby Douglas or Simone Biles. She takes seeing black excellence for granted, and a part of me hopes that she always does  —   that she’ll never know the ugly parts of the USA like I do. I hope she’ll never have to become keenly aware of societal standards that seek to limit us due to our gender, our melanin or whom we love. I hope all of this for my little niece, although sadly, a part of me suspects that it’s futile to do so."
106595,157343,"Obama press conference: Russia hacks, US election, China and Syria addressed – as it happened",Guardian,Tom McCarthy,2017-06-23,2017.0,6.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/dec/16/barack-obama-press-conference-live-video,"Barack Obama’s    news conference is finished. Here’s a summary of what he said: Obama says that at the end of his last holiday photo line he took a photo with his Marine corps band. He got choked up, he says. “But it was just one small example of all the people who have contributed to our success. I’m responsible for where we screwed up. All the successes are shared. .. On his way out, Obama is asked whether it was his last news conference. He said he’ll see. Mele Kalikimaka, Obama says. Merry Christmas, in Hawaii. Trump had promised we’d start saying Merry Christmas again and here we’re saying Mele Kalikimaka.  Obama makes fun of fake news that says Michelle Obama’s eating initiative is “a greater threat to democracy than our government going after the press if they’re issuing a story that they don’t like. People have asked me how do you feel after the election, and i say look, this is a clarifying moment, it’s a useful reminder that voting counts, politics counts.. I think people will be able to compare and contrast and make judgments about what works for the American people. ” Obama says he hopes that Trump’s plan works. He says his plan worked. “You can’t argue that we’re not better off. We are. And for that I thank the American people. .. ” Obama refuses a question about the electors. It’s their job to pick a successor, he says. “I’ve provided people with a lot of information about what happened during the course of the election, but more importantly the candidates themselves talked about their beliefs. .. the president elect, I think, has been very explicit about what he cares about, what he believes in. The electoral college is a vestige, it’s a carryover from an earlier vision of how our federal government was going to work that put a lot of premium on states. .. it’s the same type of thinking that gives Wyoming 2 senators with a half million people. .. there are some structures in our political system.. that sometimes are going to disadvantage Democrats, but the truth of the matter is if we have a strong message,. ... typically the popular vote and the electoral college vote will align. .. If we look for one explanation or one silver bullet or one easy fix for our politics then we’re probably going to be disappointed. There are just a lot of factors. .. that has made both politics and governance more challenging. .. I do hope that we all just take some time, take a breath,. .. to just reflect a little bit more about how can we get to a place where people are focused on working together based on at least some common set of facts.  Question for Obama: should current labor secretary Tom Perez run the DNC? Obama praises Perez, calling him one of the best labor secretaries in history, “tireless” and “wicked smart. ” “If you look at his body of work on behalf of working people, what he’s pushed for. .. he has been extraordinary. Now others who have declared are also my friends and are fine people as well. And the great thing is, I don’t have a vote in this. I’ve described to you earlier what I think needs to happen. Which is that the Democratic party. .. has to work at the grassroots level, has to be present in all 50 states. .. has to think about message. .. “I will say this. I could not be prouder of the coalition that I put together in each of my campaigns. Because it was inclusive and it drew in people who normally weren’t interested in politics. .. I always cast a broad net. .. there’s more that we share than divides us, and I want to talk to everybody and get a chance to get everybody’s vote. .. outside of the realm of electoral politics, I still see people the way I saw them when I made that speech. Full of contradictions. .. but basically folks care about their families, they care about having meaningful work, making sure their ckids have more opportunity than they did. They want to be safe, they want to make sure things are fair. ..  “What I was able during my campaigns, I was not able to do during midterms. .. the coalition. .. didn’t always turn out to be transferrable. ” That’s an understatement! Next question is about Trump’s conversation with the Taiwanese president and challenge to the One China policy. What’s Obama think of a “fresh” China policy? Great question, he says. “I’m somewhere in between. I think all of our foreign policy should be subject to fresh eyes. I am very proud of the work I’ve done. I think I’m a better president than when I started [but] democracy benefits from some new perspectives. “Given the importance of the relationship between the United States and China, given how much is at stake. .. there’s probably no bilateral relationship that carries more significance, and where there’s also the potential if that relationship breaks down. .. that everybody is worse off. I think it’s fine for him to take a look at it. “What I’ve advised is across the board on foreign policy, you want to make sure that you’re doing at in a systematic intentional way. .. before he starts to have a lot of interaction with foreign governments. ..that he should want to have his full team in place. .. so that as he’s then maybe taking foreign policy in a new direction, he’s got all the information to make good decisions.  “With respect to China, and let’s just take the example of Taiwan, there has been a longstanding agreement between China, the US and to some degree the Taiwanese, which is not to change the status quo. ” Obama is asked whether Putin personally directed the hacking. He says wait for the intelligence report. But he has “great confidence in their assessment that the Russians carried out this hack. The hack of the DNC and the hack of John Podesta. But again, this is why I want the report out, so that everybody can review it. ” Obama says Congress has seen the reports “and I think that what you’ve already seen is the folks that have seen the evidence don’t dispute that it was the Russians who have carried it out. ” Obama says the larger point is, “not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin. This is pretty hierarchical operation. Last I checked, there’s not a lot of debate and democratic deliberation.. this happened at the highest levels of the Russian government and I will let you . .. whether there are   Russian officials going rogue. ” “Martha I’ve given you what I’m going to give you. “As I’ve said before, I think that the president elect is still in transition mode, from campaign to governance. .. he still has campaign spokesman sort of filling in and appearing on cable shows. There’s just a whole different attitude and vibe when you’re not in power as when you’re in power. How will the   operate and how will his team operate when they’ve been fully briefed?” “The more this [hacking story] can be nonpartisan, the   the American people are going to be. I’m going to keep on repeating this point. Our vulnerability. .. is directly related to how divided, partisan, dysfunctional our political process is. That’s the thing that makes us vulnerable. If fake news is being released by some foreign government is almost identical to reports that are being issued through partisan news venues, then it’s not surprising that that foreign propaganda will have a greater effect, because it doesn’t seem so  . ” Obama warns about “domestic propagandists. ” Question for Obama: Can you assure the public this was a free and fair election? Will you declassify some of the evidence on Russian hacking? Are you concerned about the Tillerson pick and some of Trump’s closeness to Putin? Obama: I’m getting older. These   questions. .. “I can assure the public that there was not the kind of tampering with the voting process that was a concern and will continue to be a concern. That the votes that were cast were counted, they were counted appropriately. We have not seen evidence of machines being tampered with. That assurance I can provide. We paid a lot of attention to it, we worked with state officials, etc, but we feel confident that that didn’t occur and that the votes were cast and they were counted. ON declassification: “We will provide evidence that we can safely provide, that does not compromise sources and methods, but. .. when you’re talking about cybersecurity, a lot is classified. .. if we’re going to monitor this stuff effectively going forward, we don’t want them to know that we know.  “Unless the American people genuinely think that the professionals in [the intelligence community including Republicans] are less trustworthy than the Russians, then people should pay attention to what our intelligence agencies say. We’ve got to pay attention to what’s happening to our political culture here. ” Obama says that Russia is smaller and weaker and can’t hurt America. .. except: Their economy doesn’t produce anything that anybody wants to buy except oil and gas and arms. They don’t innovate. But they can impact if we lose track of who we are. .. if we start buying into notions that it’s OK to intimidate the press, or lock up dissidents, or discriminate against people because of their faith, or what they look like. .. you’re starting to see certain Republican party and voters. .. starting to see a government contrary to everything we stand for as being OK because that’s how much we dislike Democrats. Some folks who had made a career about being   didn’t say anything about it. Then after the election they say, well why didn’t you tell us that the Russians were trying to elect our candidate. Now come on. ... Over a third of Republican voters approve of Vladimir Putin, the former head of the KGB. Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave. And how did that happen? ... Because for too long, everything that happens in this town, everything that’s said, is through the prism of, does this help or hurt us relative to Democrats? Relative to president Obama? “We’ve lost track of what we’re about and what we stand for. ” As for appointments, those are up to Trump, Obama says, and to the senate to advise and consent. On safe zones, Obama says, “if you set those zones up on Syrian territory, then that requires some force that is willing to maintain that territory in the absence of consent from the Syrian government and now the Russians and the Iranians. It may be that with Aleppo’s tragic situation unfolding, if we can get some of the tens of thousands that are trapped there out. .. find some arrangement perhaps in coordination with Turkey whereby those people will be safe. .. unfortunately we’re not even there yet, because right now we have Russians and Assad claiming that all the innocent civilians that were trapped in Aleppo are out. .. try to put pressure wherever we can to try to get them out. I will help   Trump with any advice counsel information that we can provide.  Obama continues. “I mean that with all sincerity. I understand the impulse to want to do something, but ultimately I’ve had to think about what can we sustain, what is realistic and what’s the right thing to do for America?” Obama says he provided moderate support to the opposition, tried to minimize the extremist jihadi presence and tried to pressure international partners.  “I cannot claim that we’ve been successful,” he says, “but I continue to believe it was the right approach, given what realistically we could get done. ” Question: on Aleppo, do you feel any personal moral responsibility for the carnage? And Trump wants safe zones, which you’ve opposed. Will you support him? Obama: “Mike I always feel responsible. I felt responsible when kids were being shot by snipers. I felt responsible when millions of people were being displaced. .. for murder and slaughter that’s taking place in South Sudan that’s not being reported. .. There’s places around the world where horrible things are happening, and because of my office I feel responsible. .. there’s not a moment during the course of this presidency where I haven’t felt some responsibility. That’s true by the way for our own country. .. With respect to Syria, what I have consistently done is taken the best course I can to try to end the civil war while taking into account the long term national interest of the United States. .. Obama says he went through every option in Syria in painful detail with maps, humanitarian agencies, the military. .. but “short of putting large numbers of US troops on the ground, uninvited, without any international law mandate, without sufficient support from Congress. .. just gone through a decade of war and spent trillions of dollars, when the opposition on the ground was not cohesive enough. ..and you had a military superpower in Russia. ..and a regional power in Iran. .. that in that circumstance, unless we were all in and we were willing to take over Syria, then we were going to have problems. And everything else sounded tempting. .. but it was impossible to do this on the cheap. .. ” Obama pauses as someone passes out or faints. Obama says go get a doctor. Obama resumes. “It may be that. .. Nope, they need a doctor. A woman appears to have fallen down. She has been picked up. Now they are helping her from the room. They’re going for a doctor.  Questions for Obama: what about Clinton’s contention that Comey’s letter about emails on  ’s computer affected the outcome of the election? Also, what’s risk of Trump ignoring Russian hack? Obama takes second question first: “The transition from election season to governance season is not always smooth. You know it’s bumpy. ” “When Donald Trump takes the oath of office and is sworn in, he’s got a different set of responsibilities and considerations. ” On his conversations with Trump: “They have been cordial, and in some cases have involved me making some pretty specific suggestions about how to be sure. ..a bout maintaining the effectiveness, integrity, cohesion of the office, our various democratic institutions. And he has listened. I can’t say that he will end up implementing. ..and I will always make myself available to him. ” On the FBI: “I’ve had a chance to know a lot of FBI agents. .. they take their job seriously. They work really hard. They help keep us safe and save a lot of lives. .. “Sometimes that involves investigations that touch on politics. In this hyperpartisan environment everything is suspect. .. one thing I have done. ..is not wading into investigation decisions. .. to be strict in my own behaviour about preserving the independence of law enforcement. ... I don’t know why it would stop now.  “The reason I’m going on here is because I know you guys have a lot of questions about this. “With respect to response, my principle goal. .. was making sure that the election itself went off without a hitch, that it was not tarnish, and that it did not feed any sense in the public that tampering had taken place in the actual process of voting. “Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia and others not to do this to us, because we can do stuff to you. .. some of it we can do publicly, some of it we will do in a way that they know it, but not everybody will. ” “We already have enormous numbers of sanctions on the Russians. .. how we approach an appropriate response that increases costs for them. .. but does not creat ea problem for us is something that’s worth taking time to figure out.  “There are times where the message will be directly received by the Russians and not publicized. ” “I should point out that part of the reason the Russians have been effective is they’re not going around the world saying look at what we did!” Obama is asked whether Clinton lost because of the Russians: I’m going to let all the political pundits in this town have a long discussion about what happened. .. it was a fascinating election. .. I’ve said what is important for the Democratic party. .. rather than trying to parse every aspect of the election. .. I don’t think she was treated fairly during the election. .. I think the coverage of her and the issues was troubling. But having said that, what I’m most focused on. .. I can maybe give some counsel and advice to the Democratic party, and the thing we have to spend the most time on is, how do we make sure that we’re showing up in places where I think Democratic policies are needed. ..but people feel like they’re not being heard. .. We have to be in those communities. Obama: I’m finding it a little curious that everybody’s acting surprised that this would have undermined the election of Hillary Clinton because you guys wrote about it every day . .. this was an obsession that dominated the news coverage. I do think it’s [important to ask how such a momentous election] came to be dominated by these leaks. “This was not some elaborate, complicated espionage scheme. They hacked into some Democratic party emails that contained fairly routine stuff. Some of it embarrassing or controversial . .. And then it just took off. And that concerns me, and it should concern all of us. But the truth of the matter is that everybody had the information. “Moving forward, I think there are a couple issues that this raises. Number one, the constant challenges that we are going to have with cybersecurity . .. this particular concern around Russian hacking is part of a broader set of concerns about how do we deal with cybersecurity. ” Obama points out that Trump was raising questions about the integrity of the election. He says that the White House undermining that integrity further would not have been good.  “In early September when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way . .. was to talk to him directly, and to tell him to cut it out and there would be consequences if they didn’t. ”  “We did not see further tampering of the election process, but the leaks from Wikileaks were already out there. ” “I think we handled it the way it should have been handled,” he says."
110692,164975,Total Failure: How George Foreman’s Losses Showed Him The Light,NPR,Michael May,2017-05-24,2017.0,5.0,http://www.npr.org/2017/05/24/528995768/total-failure-how-george-foremans-losses-showed-him-the-light,"George Foreman at 25 years old was a fearsome champion: 6 foot 4, biceps thick and gnarled as oak, a permanent scowl on his face and a right hand that flattened every opponent he faced. So when Muhammad Ali challenged him in 1974 for a championship fight dubbed the Rumble in the Jungle in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) most bets were on Foreman. Ali was seven years older and past his prime. He’d had his title stripped after refusing the Vietnam draft in 1967 and was struggling to become a contender again. Foreman was undefeated and planning to stay that way. ”I took the fight because I could knock him out in two rounds,” he says. ”I thought, ’$5 million for two rounds? Wow!’ ” The highly anticipated fight was financed by Zaire’s dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, and included a multiday music festival that featured James Brown and Miriam Makeba. Then, on Oct. 30, 1974, the two fighters entered the ring in the nation’s capital of Kinshasa. ”As we were in the ring,” Foreman remembers, ”I was staring at him trying to intimidate him and he said, ’George, you were a kid going to high school when I was champion of the world.’ ” Everyone expected Ali to dance around Foreman and avoid his powerful punches. Instead, Ali came out swinging with his right hand, which seemed to disorient Foreman. But Foreman remained confident. ”So I figured I’d knock him out in the second round,” he says. ”You can always tell when you hurt a fighter, he always has something to say. He leaned in and whispered, ’That all you got George?’ ”And I knew from that point, this guy could take a punch and endure.” Ali kept enduring. He would lean back on the ropes and let Foreman hit him, over and over. And he was exhausted from throwing punches by the eighth round. ”He came off the ropes and I came off the ropes with my hand down to come after him,” he says. ”And he hit me with fastest right hand I ever remember receiving in the boxing ring. It was fast more than anything.  ! And I thought, my God I’m going down. And I hit the canvas.” Foreman got up at the count of nine, but the judges stopped the fight anyway. Foreman had never lost before. And it was devastating. ”You never know how important it is that people would have some . .. I hate to say fear but respect is kinda like fear,” he says. ”Now all of a sudden, these people are looking at me with a pitiful eye.” At this point, Foreman didn’t really have anything in his life except boxing. He’d grown up poor  —   literally hungry, without enough food. He was so ashamed he’d bring an empty lunch bag to school. ”I’d seen that pity before,” he says. ”When I was a teenager looking for a job. You fill out your application, and people look at you ’Ah, well, we don’t need anyone right now.’ And there I was, back in same position  —   and I didn’t like it.” As a teenager, Foreman had channeled that rage and frustration into fighting: first on the streets, then in the ring. And after losing to Ali, he became paranoid. He didn’t trust anyone and kept to himself. ”You start getting a little hate in you,” he says. ”I’m going to pay the world back, show them, that kind of thing.” Foreman won his next five matches. He was on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the headline ”I want Ali again.” ”I thought I could use that hate to get my title back,” he says. ”It was no longer the title  —   it was my title.” But Ali wouldn’t accept the challenge. Foreman finally got his chance for redemption when he took on a talented fighter named Jimmy Young. Everything depended on this fight. If Foreman won, Ali would be forced to accept a rematch. He’d get that chance to win back his title. The fight took place in Puerto Rico on March 17, 1977. Foreman didn’t score a knockout in the early rounds and the two fighters settled into a long, close fight. But by the 12th round, Foreman was clearly exhausted. At one point, he fell to his knees. He made it to the final round, but the judges declared that Young had won. Foreman headed to his dressing room. The air conditioning wasn’t working in the arena and he began to pace up and down to cool off. ”You are told never to sit down after a boxing match,” he says. Foreman became convinced he was going to die he says he could literally smell death in the room. He wasn’t a religious man, but he started to pray to God for his life. ”I started walking faster and faster, everyone is looking at me,” he says. ”My legs started to curl and I told everyone in the room, ’I’m fixing to . ...’ But before I could say another word  —   around me, under my feet, around me  —   there was nothing. I was in this deep, dark junkyard of nothing. There wasn’t any hope.” Foreman collapsed. His trainers pulled him up and laid him down on the table. ”I said ’I don’t care if this is death, I still believe there’s a God,’ ” he says. ”When I said that, a gigantic hand reached in and held me. I jumped off the table and started screaming, ’Jesus Christ has come alive in me!’ I said, ’I got to save the world!’ They said, ’No, you need clothes on!’ They held me down until the ambulance took me to intensive care in the hospital. That experience changed me forever.” Foreman gave up boxing that day. He became a minister and opened a youth center. But the biggest change was right there on his face: George Foreman started smiling. Foreman looks back now and it’s like his whole biography has been turned upside down. He now sees those early successes as the real failure, because he didn’t appreciate them. ”I went over to Africa. I didn’t see a wild animal in the natural,” he says. ”I missed all those things. A whole lifetime missed. I was too focused on the  :     punch.” Ten years after losing to Jimmy Young, Foreman entered the ring again. He says he did it to raise money for his youth center. But there was something else. He wanted to show he could still win, but this time without hate or anger. ”The second time, I really had a time to journey in life. I learned words like, Konichiwa. I went to South Africa and met the different tribes,” he says. ”You get a second chance to live and it makes a better person out of you. You realize that wasn’t really a loss for me in Africa  —   it was a gain that I didn’t appreciate. In 1994, George Foreman regained his title at age 45. He was the oldest fighter to ever win the heavyweight championship. This story is the second in a   series on the experience of failure and how people deal with it. It was developed in NPR’s Story Lab. Nicholas DePrey created original music for the series."
111100,165501,"Stage Managers: You Can’t See Them, But Couldn’t See A Show Without Them",NPR,Jeff Lunden,2017-06-11,2017.0,6.0,http://www.npr.org/2017/06/11/532072399/stage-managers-you-cant-see-them-but-couldnt-see-a-show-without-them,"On Sunday night the spotlight will be on Broadway stars at the 71st annual Tony Awards. The evening also includes honors for some people behind the scenes  —   writers, directors and designers, for example  —   but there are many more, working backstage, who aren’t eligible for Broadway’s highest honor. If you peek into the wings at a Broadway show, you’re likely to find a stage manager, sitting at a desk with video monitors and lots of buttons and switches. He or she will be wearing a headset  —   sometimes called ”the God mic”  —   to communicate with the cast and crew. ”I like to think of a stage manager as the chief operations officer of the corporation that is the show,” says Ira Mont, stage manager of Cats. Donald Fried, stage manager of the   play, Sweat, says stage managers are kind of ”the Captain of the Enterprise.” ”I would call us the hub of the wheel,” says Karyn Meek, production stage manager for the   musical Natasha, Pierre  The Great Comet of 1812. ”We are . .. in charge of communication across all departments. . .. During the show, we are in charge of making sure the lights happen, the set moves, sound happens, all the things . .. we are the person who’s controlling all of that.” Long before a show starts its run, the stage manager is an integral part of the rehearsal process, explains Fried. ”Everything begins and ends with the script,” he says. ”I’ve got to read the script, read it several times. Once, just to read it as a person, not as a stage manager or an artist or anything. Just to have an initial emotional feeling for it. Then, I go back and read [the writer’s] stage directions, so that I know what would happen   how she envisions the props, how she envisions the set moving, people entering and exiting, whether or not they’re changing costumes.” Once a show is up and running, Meek says stage managers and their teams put in long hours. Her day begins at 9:30 a. m. with cast members telling her whether they’d be in or out of that day’s shows, due to injuries or illness. Depending on the day, she’ll arrive at the theater around 12:30 for a matinee or rehearsal. There’s a dinner break around 5:00 or 5:30, and then everyone’s back at the theater for the evening show. Shows that feature complicated choreography or simulated fight scenes require daily rehearsals. Sweat manager Donald Fried says they do a fight rehearsal before every show. ”We want to make sure everyone is safe and limber, and that the props are working,” he explains. In the half hour before each performance, the stage manager walks through a beehive of activity, making sure everyone’s ready for curtain. Meek climbs a ladder to her perch, high above stage left at Great Comet. Actors perform throughout the theater and Meek can keep an eye on them all. Once the show starts, she follows a musical score, with sticky notes showing all of the lighting and tech cues. Through one of her video monitors, she can see Josh Groban, who plays Pierre, standing at the back of the stage. By the time the opening number really gets going, Meek is calling cues to the lighting technician every other beat. She literally calls hundreds of sound and tech cues for each performance. All the stage managers I spoke with started out doing other things  —   Meek was a costume designer, Fried was a dancer. As a former actor, Cats manager Ira Mont was used to getting applause  —   but not anymore. ”I don’t expect or look for praise or acknowledgement,” he says. ”I am here to support the shows I work on and the actors who do them and that’s what gives me the joy. And I’m very fortunate to have had a   career in a profession that is not easy to get into and is not easy to stay in. I’m a lucky guy.” He’s got lucky   too. Even as Mont juggles countless cues that go into a Broadway performance of Cats, over the headset he reminds the cast and crew of one more detail: to gather for a cast member’s birthday toast at the end of the show."
111393,165870,"Despite Claims To Contrary, Trump Has Signed No Major Laws 5 Months In",NPR,Tamara Keith,2017-06-23,2017.0,6.0,http://www.npr.org/2017/06/23/533840991/despite-claims-to-contrary-trump-has-signed-no-major-laws-5-months-in,"Updated 12:30 p. m. ET, President Trump kept one of his campaign promises, signing a bill Friday to make it easier for the secretary of veterans affairs to fire and discipline employees. It came in response to the 2014 VA scandal in which employees covered up long wait times while collecting bonuses. The bill, which passed earlier this month with strong bipartisan support, also gives the secretary authority to revoke bonuses and protects whistleblowers who report wrongdoing. ”What happened was a national disgrace and yet some of the employees involved in these scandals remained on the payrolls,” Trump said just before signing the bill. ”Outdated laws kept the government from holding those who failed our veterans accountable. Today we are finally changing those laws.” The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 marks Trump’s 40th law signed. Sounds like a lot. And in recent days, Trump has boasted about all the legislation he has signed. ”We passed and signed 38 pieces of legislation, which nobody likes to talk about,” Trump said June 13 before a lunch with lawmakers. ”I think probably seldom has any president and administration done more or had more success so early on, including a record number of resolutions to eliminate   regulations.” And he tweeted the same message on Friday morning. A White House spokesperson confirmed to NPR that at the time of Trump’s tweet, the number was actually 39  —   not 38. Measuring laws passed by counting rather than by significance is pretty meaningless. More on that in a bit. Among modern Oval Office occupants, Presidents Jimmy Carter (52) George H. W. Bush (41) and Bill Clinton (41) had all signed more bills into law than Trump has by this point in their presidencies. So, what has Trump accomplished with Congress so far? Nothing that political scientists would categorize as major pieces of legislation. We looked at this question as Trump hit his 100 days mark. This story contains more detail on legislation he signed in the early part of his presidency. As he said, Trump has signed a record number of resolutions reversing   regulations, 15 in total. These resolutions were passed under the Congressional Review Act and only required a simple majority for passage in the Senate. It was only used once before, by George W. Bush. That made it much easier to get them through than regular legislation. The Congressional Review Act was passed in 1996 and allows Congress to reverse rules within 60 legislative days of their submission. That period is now over, so you won’t see more laws like these any time soon. Two of the laws he has signed are budget related. One simply extended federal spending for a week while Congress worked out its differences on a   funding bill. The other was possibly the most significant legislation signed by Trump so far. It kept the government funded and set spending levels through the end of September. But these sorts of spending bills are also the most basic functions of Congress and the president, literally keeping the lights on. On June 6, Trump signed a law designating the courthouse on Church Street in Nashville, Tenn. as the Fred D. Thompson Federal Building and United States Courthouse. Thompson served in the Senate, representing Tennessee from 1994 to 2003 and briefly ran for president in 2008. But he is best known for playing District Attorney Arthur Branch on the   police procedural drama Law and Order on NBC. He died in 2015. There was no formal signing ceremony for that bill. On May 16, the president signed a law requiring the government to allow federal employees to use Uber, Lyft, bike sharing and other forms of alternative transportation for official travel. The Modernizing Government Travel Act was also introduced last year and passed the House but wasn’t taken up by the Senate. ”I will say that never has there been a president  —   with few exceptions in the case of [Franklin D. Roosevelt] he had a major depression to handle  —   who’s passed more legislation, who’s done more things than what we’ve done,” Trump said at the start of a recent Cabinet meeting, ”between the executive orders and the   regulations that have been terminated. Many bills I guess over 34 bills that Congress signed.” Repealing   Rules And Regulations (15) Modifying Existing Programs (6) Encouraging An Agency To Try Something New (5) Naming   A   Flag Flying (5)   (5) Extending   Policy (2) Omnibus Appropriations Bill (1) New Policy (1) Legislative links and text via GovTrack."
111698,166243,Here’s What You Shouldn’t Do When Trying To Revive A Newborn,NPR,Malaka Gharib,2016-01-07,2016.0,1.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/01/07/461935008/so-heres-what-you-shouldnt-do-when-trying-to-revive-a-newborn,"”You have a minute to help that baby breathe,” says Dr. Mark Hathaway. He works as a senior adviser for family planning at USAID’s Maternal and Child Survival Program, and he is showing me how to get a newborn to take its first breath. And it has to happen now  —   during the ”golden minute” after a baby is born. That’s what the medical world calls the tiny window of time an infant must bring oxygen into its lungs. But I’m not a doctor or a nurse. I’m a reporter. So I am pretty clueless. I lift up the ”baby,” a mannequin called NeoNatalie. Filled with water and covered with soft plastic, it’s heavier than I expected  —   about 5 or 6 pounds, just like a real newborn. A wave of panic washes over me. I do what I remember seeing on TV shows. I lift the baby by its feet and slap its backside. ”Yeah, don’t do that,” says Hathaway. I have a lot of company in the club of clueless birth attendants. In the developing world, there’s a dire shortage of health care workers and nearly half of all births take place without a skilled birth attendant. A nonprofit called Seed Global Health is determined to change things. In 2012, Seed teamed up with the Peace Corps to create the Global Health Service Partnership, a volunteer program that sends U. S. doctors and nurses to Africa to train medical professionals in a variety of techniques, including how to resuscitate a newborn who’s not breathing. Seed Global Health has so far introduced the program in Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and, most recently, Swaziland. In the past two years, 73 American volunteers have trained more than 7, 200 African faculty, residents and students. After my failed attempts to help my mannequin breathe, Hathaway shows me the proper procedures. He turns the doll to one side and begins vigorously drying its back and head with a towel to help the baby warm up. ”Sometimes that’s all that’s needed,” says Hathaway. If that doesn’t do the trick, he has all the tools ready for Plans B and C: a suction tool and a bag mask. The suction tool, which looks like a turkey baster, clears out a baby’s nasal passages by removing mucus and gunk from its nose. Using it once is usually enough to help a baby breathe. If 20 seconds go by and the baby still isn’t breathing, Hathaway would turn to the bag mask, which pumps oxygen from the air into the baby’s lung passages. Aliasgar Khaki, a      medical student from Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, is one of the trainees. He was taught by Dr. Esther Johnston, a former Seed Global Health volunteer who is now the director of family medicine for the nonprofit. In Khaki’s country, roughly a quarter of newborn deaths are caused by birth asphyxia  —   a lack of oxygen to the lungs. But the university he attends didn’t have the resources to teach its students the proper techniques. ”They had a program, but the problem was that the equipment wasn’t there,” says Johnston. ”It’s hard to teach neonatal resuscitation without a mannequin. You can teach the principles, but if you don’t practice it, it doesn’t get into your muscle memory.” Inspired, Khaki started organizing trainings for other students, nurses and interns in the area, demonstrating with donated NeoNatalie dolls from global health groups like Jhpiego. The NeoNatalie set costs about $70 for nonprofits. Dr. Vanessa Kerry,   of Seed Global Health, hopes the trainees will now show others what they’ve learned. ”If we focused on teaching new doctors and nurses how to be great educators with the idea that one doctor could go on and teach 10, who could go on to teach 10 more, and so on, we could have this great force multiplying effect,” she says. For Hathaway, the future of Seed Global Health’s training program will ultimately rely on the power of the individual. ”What moves things forward is a champion,” he says. ”If you have someone in a health facility who really wants the infant mortality reduction to happen, that person will work hard to keep following through on things.” Since Khaki’s training with Seed Global Health, he’s had a chance to practice his neonatal resuscitation skills in real life. A week after his first training with Johnston, he visited a hospital with a relative. In the nursery ward, he saw a ”code blue” situation: a baby struggling to breathe. The nurse on duty didn’t know what to do. Khaki quickly stepped in and saved the baby’s life, using the    techniques he learned from his training (which is what Hathaway showed me in my  ). How did it make him feel? ”Every cartoon character has their own superhero outfit,” he says. ”Mine was my white lab coat.”"
112999,167692,Tests Say The Water Is Safe. But Flint’s Restaurants Still Struggle ,NPR,Cheryl Corley,2016-03-08,2016.0,3.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/03/08/469515295/tests-say-the-water-is-safe-but-flints-restaurants-still-struggle,"The once routine practice of getting a glass of water before a restaurant meal in Flint, Mich. is now fraught with apprehension, since lead pipes started leaching into the drinking water after officials switched to the highly corrosive Flint River as the city’s water supply. The crisis over   water has touched every aspect of life in Flint, and for restaurants, it could not have come at a worse time. In the past few years, restaurants have been resurging, especially in downtown Flint. Now, they are trying to recoup lost business and convince leery customers that their water is safe. Flint switched back to Lake Huron for its drinking water late last year. But despite the ongoing testing for lead, city and state officials say it’s time to go on the offense in regard to restaurants. George Wilkinson, vice president for the Flint  Genesee Chamber of Commerce, says everyone should know ”that it’s OK to come out and go to these different restaurants for meals, because the water’s been tested, it’s certified and it’s clear. Flint is open for business.” Blackstone’s Pub and Grill is one eatery that has helped to revitalize Flint’s downtown. Posters on its front windows promote concerts and other events, but one prominently displayed sign lists the results of the restaurant’s test results in big bold letters: ”Water  —   lead free.” However, the lunch crowd inside is thin. Manager Patti Bergstrom says business has been slack. ”We’ve noticed a change. We get a lot of phone calls like, ’Oh my goodness, what do you do for your water? How do you wash your dishes?’ ” she says. Bergstrom says restaurants know that keeping lead out of their water is crucial. When they rinse produce, for example, they let the water run first for a while, to flush any lead that may have settled in the plumbing overnight. Many restaurants have bought expensive filtration systems to keep the lead out of beverage machines, bar guns,   and dishwashers. Bergstrom says Blackstone’s new filtration system cost about $800, with $250 replacement filters. Some restaurants buy bagged ice. And unlike Flint residents, they also have to buy bottled water. The Flint  Genesee chamber tries to mitigate that cost by offering free water to businesses twice a week. Amy Hadd, a secretary eating lunch at Blackstone’s, lifts her glass of water. ”I feel comfortable drinking the water here,” she says. ”It’s filtered. It’s been tested. As long as the results are posted, I don’t mind.” The Genesee County Health Department sent a letter to restaurants about how to handle tap water last October, but they were just guidelines distributed before the water emergency was declared. Anthony Pavone, a supervisor with the Health Department, says inspectors have since tested hundreds of facilities, including chain restaurants. ”A lot of them already had filters on their pop and ice machines, just because they want their product to be consistent at all their locations,” he says. ”They take every precaution they can for variations in different water supplies.” The iconic Angelo’s Coney Island has been operating in Flint for more than 60 years. A sign at the front of the restaurant says: ”All of our beverages and ice are made with filtered water.” But even here, says manager Carlos Amos, business is down. ”The first question out of everybody’s mouth is, ’Do you have Flint water?’ ” Amos says the restaurant’s owner bought a new filtration system and stacks of bottled water to sell to customers who prefer it. On every table, there’s a copy of an inspection report showing no lead in Coney Island’s water. Mason Miller, a General Motors retiree eating breakfast at the restaurant, says he doesn’t pay much attention to the signs, because he expects clean water. ”You would think that would be the No. 1 priority on a restaurant list  —   to make sure that people could come in here and be safe,” he says. That’s an opinion that many of the restaurateurs in Flint hope more people will embrace during a water crisis that has yet to be resolved."
113816,168619,#MemeOfTheWeek: Harriet Tubman And The Evolution Of Internet Phenomena,NPR,Sam Sanders,2016-04-21,2016.0,4.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/04/21/475034184/-memeoftheweek-harriet-tubman-and-the-evolution-of-internet-phenomena,"On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew announced that former slave and abolitionist Harriet Tubman would grace a new version of the $20 bill. The news came after a prolonged effort to get women’s faces on U. S. currency, with Tubman’s name mentioned for several months. On the surface, the Tubman 20 announcement could be seen as an overwhelmingly acceptable development. A feel good story. A chance to celebrate. But over the course of just one day, Harriet Tubman and her place on our money came to represent the eternal timeline of Internet phenomena, a   cycle of a good thing becoming bad, a real thing becoming fake, something innocuous turning toxic. Also, because Internet, Hamilton and Beyonce seem to always end up part of said conversation. Let’s explore. When the news hit the Internet Wednesday morning, there was the expected celebration, with tweets like these. And Tubman was not the only woman the Internet celebrated. It was also announced that suffragists Lucretia Mott, Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Alice Paul would make it onto the new $10 bill as well. But then there was a second, more critical, wave of social media reaction. Some thought the depiction of Tubman should be truer to who she was, a rebel not afraid to use force. Others disliked the fact that Andrew Jackson would still be on the same bill as well, just on the other side. And there was a bit of chatter around the fact that   Lin Manuel Miranda actually lobbied to keep one man on U. S. currency, Alexander Hamilton himself. Then some suggested that the entire notion of putting Tubman on U. S. currency was in itself, offensive. Why make a woman who was bought and sold with U. S. dollars the symbol of one of the tools used to keep her in chains? A video from a few months ago resurfaced Thursday, making those points. Before the day was done, neurosurgeon and former presidential candidate Ben Carson chimed in on Harriet Tubman. He suggested that she should not grace the $20, but instead, the $2 bill, in order to keep Jackson on the bill. The Internet quickly rebuked Carson. As the day came to an end, social media rediscovered a blog post from March of this year, saying the famous Harriet Tubman quote that had been widely shared online to celebrate was actually wrong. Turns out Tubman never said of her work as an abolitionist: ”I could have saved thousands  —   if only I’d been able to convince them they were slaves.” And Twitter released data showing that even Harriet Tubman couldn’t have her time in the spotlight without having Beyoncé in the conversation as well. Because Beyoncé. It is fitting perhaps, our treatment of Tubman in this moment. She, maybe one of the most authentic historical figures of all time, is still subject to the Internet’s game of constant redefinition,     and  . The Internet tends to make all things creatures of Internet, with all that entails. There is no getting around it. From this fact, it seems even an abolitionist can not break free."
114098,168953,Frozen Food Recall Expands To 358 Products Amid Listeria Fears,NPR,Dana Farrington,2016-05-04,2016.0,5.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/04/476773290/frozen-food-recall-expands-to-358-products-amid-listeria-fears,"Time to check your frozen fruit and vegetable packages: CRF Frozen Foods has expanded a voluntary recall to include about 358 products under 42 different brands because of potential listeria contamination. A full list of the items to avoid was included in the company’s press release on Monday. The recall includes all frozen organic and nonorganic fruit and vegetable products manufactured or processed at CRF’s facility in Pasco, Wash. since May 1, 2014. The products have a ”best by” or ”sell by” date between April 26, 2016, and April 26, 2018, CRF said. The food has been sold across the U. S. and in Canada in grocers including Safeway, Trader Joe’s and Costco. Initially, the company voluntarily recalled 15 frozen vegetable items after a routine state health inspection in Ohio detected listeria. The company says it suspended operations at the Pasco plant on April 25 ”so a thorough review could be conducted.” CRF products have been linked to a listeria outbreak that has infected eight people in three states since September 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two of those people died, but the CDC says that ”listeriosis was not considered to be a cause of death.” If you figure out that you’ve bought recalled products, the CDC recommends you throw them away in a closed plastic bag, clean the area where they were stored and then wash your hands with warm water and soap. Think you’ve eaten recalled products? If you have symptoms  —   usually fever and muscle aches, sometimes preceded by gastrointestinal issues  —   ”consider seeking medical care,” the CDC says. ”The disease primarily affects older adults, pregnant women, newborns, and adults with weakened immune systems,” the health agency notes."
114211,169090,Canadian Officials Hope Wildfire Fight Has Reached A Turning Point,NPR,Camila Domonoske,2016-05-09,2016.0,5.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/09/477364289/canadian-officials-hope-wildfire-fight-has-reached-a-turning-point,"A change in the weather has helped firefighters battling a massive blaze in Fort McMurray, a Canadian   town in the province of Alberta. Cooler temperatures and light rain have officials sounding optimistic, hopeful that the wildfire  —   which continues to burn  —   might have reached a ”turning point” that will lead to its containment. ”This is great firefighting weather,” Alberta fire official Chad Morrison said at a weekend news conference. ”We can really get in there and really get a handle on this fire . .. get a death grip on it.” Officials had expected the blaze to double in size on Saturday instead, The Associated Press reports, it’s now slightly smaller than it was then. Cooler weather is expected to continue for a few more days, Dan Karpenchuk reports for NPR. Meanwhile, the government is taking this opportunity to evaluate the extent of the damage from the fire, which has forced 80, 000 people to evacuate their homes. Karpenchuk reports: ”The premier of Alberta, Rachel Notley, will travel to Fort McMurray today along with planners to begin the work of determining what needs to be done first and how to bring thousands of people back home. ”Crews will assess the damage as well as checking on infrastructure such as natural gas lines and the electrical power grid. Firefighters were able to keep the flames away from critical infrastructure such as the hospital and the water treatment plant. ”The last damage assessment, a week ago, estimated 1, 600 homes and buildings had been destroyed.” Fort McMurray  —   an outpost supported by the oil sands industry  —   was largely populated by people who had moved to town to work for the oil sands mines. Many workers had been hit hard by the recent drop in oil prices. And for some, there might be a silver lining in the smoke. Reuters spoke to a homeless evacuee from Fort McMurray, Terry MacDuff, who said he had nothing to lose in the fire and was ”living like a king” at the Lac la Biche evacuation center. The wire service reports: ”At Lac La Biche, evacuees are given a place to sleep, access to health services, unlimited food and a gym full of clothes and goods donated from the community. ”MacDuff plans to return to Fort McMurray and believes that eventually more people will be put back to work as the city rebuilds. ” ’This fire saved a lot of people. There will be a lot of work in the cleanup,’ he said.”"
117327,172996,"Doll Therapy May Help Calm People With Dementia, But It Has Critics",NPR,Anna Gorman,2016-10-03,2016.0,10.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/10/03/495655678/doll-therapy-may-help-calm-people-with-dementia-but-it-has-critics,"Sitting beside a neatly made crib,    Vivian Guzofsky holds up a baby doll dressed in puppy dog pajamas. ”Hello gorgeous,” she says, laughing. ”You’re so cute.” Guzofsky, who has Alzheimer’s disease, lives on a secure memory floor at a home for seniors in Beverly Hills, Calif. She visits the dolls in the home’s pretend nursery nearly every day. Sometimes Guzofsky changes their clothes or lays them down for a nap. One morning in August, she sings to them: ”You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are gray.” No one knows whether she believes she is holding a doll or a real baby. What the staff at Sunrise Senior Living do know is that Guzofsky, who can get agitated and aggressive, is always calm when caring for the dolls. Doll therapy is catching on at nursing homes and other senior facilities across the country. It’s used to help ease anxiety among residents with dementia, who can experience personality changes, agitation and aggression. But the therapy is controversial. Supporters say the dolls can lessen distress, improve communication and reduce the need for psychotropic medication. Critics say the dolls are demeaning and infantilize seniors. Typically, caregivers will give residents the option of holding, changing or dressing the dolls, without saying whether the dolls are babies or toys. Caregivers may also use the dolls to start conversations about the residents’ own children or grandchildren. Care providers who use the technique say the dolls help engage elderly people who are no longer able to participate in many activities. ”A lot of people with Alzheimer’s are bored and may become depressed or agitated or unhappy because they aren’t engaged,” says Ruth Drew, director of family  information services at the Alzheimer’s Association. Caregivers aren’t trying to make their charges believe the dolls are real infants, Drew says. They are just ”trying to meet them where they are and communicate with them in a way that makes sense to them,” she says. But some care providers do not like the technique. ”They are adults and we want to treat them like adults,” says Stephanie Zeverino, who works in community relations at a Belmont Village center in Los Angeles. ”These are very   residents.” Staff members there work with residents to play brain games that promote critical thinking, she says. And they use other types of therapy including art and music. ”We want to provide a sense of dignity,” Zeverino says. Studies on doll therapy are limited, but some research has shown it can reduce the need for medications and lessen agitation, aggression and wandering. ”Having the doll . .. offers them an anchor or a sense of attachment in a time of uncertainty,” says Gary Mitchell, a nurse specialist at Four Seasons Health Care facilities in Northern Ireland, and author of a new book: Doll Therapy in Dementia Care: Evidence and Practice. ”A lot of people associate the doll with their younger days and having people to care for,” Mitchell says. However, he acknowledges that doll therapy can perpetuate the stigma associated with dementia that care givers are trying to get away from. Some families worry about their relatives being laughed at when they engage in doll therapy, Mitchell says. He had the same concerns when he worked at a senior residential center. But when one resident requested that he allow her to continue caring for a doll, he saw the positive impact of the therapy. Mitchell says doll therapy should be used cautiously and more studies are needed. At Sunrise Beverly Hills, the nursery is set up like a baby’s room. A stuffed bear rests inside the wooden crib. On a shelf above are framed photos of Guzofsky and a few other women who regularly interact with the dolls. A few bottles, a Dr. Seuss book and diapers sit on a nearby changing table. The nursery is just one of several areas designed to engage residents, says Rita Altman, senior vice president of memory care for Sunrise, which has facilities in the U. S. Canada and the United Kingdom. There are also art centers, offices, gardens and kitchens where residents may find familiar objects from their past. Altman says the nurseries tend to attract residents who have an instinct to care for babies. Some people may not be able to talk anymore, but still find a sense of security with a doll, she says. ”You can read it in their body language when they pick up the doll.” Sunrise caregivers also use the dolls to spark conversations by asking questions: How many children do you have? Was your first baby a boy or a girl? What are the best things about being a mom? The executive director of the Beverly Hills facility, Jason Malone, says he was skeptical about the use of dolls when he first heard about them. ”I almost felt like we were being deceitful,” he says. ”It didn’t feel like it was real.” But he quickly changed his mind when he realized that staff could use the dolls respectfully. ”We don’t want to confuse treating our seniors as children,” Malone says. ”That’s not what this activity is truly about.” Guzofsky began caring for the dolls soon after moving into the facility. When asked what she likes about them, she says, ”I love babies. I have some very nice ones back where I live now.” Guzofsky’s daughter, Carol Mizel, says her mom raised three children and volunteered extensively in Colorado and Mexico before being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s about five years ago. Mizel doesn’t see any downside to her mother caring for the dolls. It is a ”creative way of dealing with her where she is now,” she says. For some residents, including    Marilou Roos, holding the dolls is one of the only times they interact with the staff. Roos uses a wheelchair and rarely speaks. She sleeps much of the day. ”There is not much [Marilou] can participate in,” says Vladimir Kaplun, former coordinator of the secure memory floor. ”When she spends some time with the babies, she wakes up and she brightens up.” On a recent day, caregiver Jessica Butler sits next to Roos, who holds a doll against her chest and pats her on the back. She kisses the doll twice. ”The baby’s beautiful like you,” Butler says. ”It’s a boy,” Roos says. ”Five months.” Caring for the dolls is second nature to Roos, who made a career of being a mom to five children, according to her daughter, Ellen Swarts. It’s been difficult for Swarts to watch the decline of her mother, who hasn’t called her by name in over a year. Watching her with the dolls helps, Swarts says. ”To see the light in her eyes when she has a baby in her arms, I don’t care if it’s real or if it’s pretending,” she said. ”If that gives her comfort, I am   with it.” Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.

119427,175767,Zuma’s ex-wife given boost in South Africa leadership race,Reuters,Joe Brock,2017-01-07,2017.0,1.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-politics-idUSKBN14R0N0?il=0  ," The chances of South African President Jacob Zuma’s   Nkosazana   becoming the next leader of the African National Congress were given a boost on Saturday with the endorsement of the ruling party’s women’s division. The ANC will pick a new leader at a conference in December and, given its national dominance since coming to power at the end of apartheid in 1994, the winner is likely to go on to be South Africa’s next president when elections are held in 2019.   the chairwoman of the African Union, is viewed as a frontrunner. She is a Zulu, the largest tribe in South Africa, and is expected to have the backing of her former husband, who will have a major say in who succeeds him. The Women’s League’s endorsement is the first for a specific candidate by a national section of the ANC and will intensify the debate over who will take the party forward after it suffered its worst local election results last year.   was regarded as a capable technocrat during her time as South Africa’s minister of home affairs between 2009 and 2012 and has since gained international exposure during her time as the first female head of the AU. However, critics of   a medical doctor trained in South Africa and Britain, say she should have done more to intervene when former president Thabo Mbeki denied that HIV causes AIDs and imposed   policies. Mbeki’s stance has been blamed by health activists for more than 300, 000 preventable deaths.   was foreign minister in Mbeki’s cabinet and one of his closest allies. Vice President Cyril Ramaphosa, a    tycoon, is viewed as her most likely rival after powerful trade unions endorsed him last year.  Neither   67, or Ramaphosa, 64, have declared their intention to run. Ramaphosa, who was once touted as a successor to Nelson Mandela, would be the first choice for many investors because his background in commerce suggests he will support more   policies than many in the traditionally   ANC. However, he will face criticism from opponents for his role at platinum producer Lonmin where he was a director and shareholder when violence led to police shooting dead 34 striking miners in 2012. An investigation has cleared him of wrongdoing. The Women’s League has a block of votes at the party conference and are a critical lobbying group for the ANC, particularly in galvanising support among female voters. ”After careful consideration and opening our eyes as wide as possible, Nkosazana   is the only suitable candidate,” the Women’s League said in a statement. ”Her legacy and influence is known and well documented throughout the history pages of the republic and beyond.” Many South Africans believe it is time the ANC had a female leader, a rarity on a continent with strong patriarchal heritage. Zuma has previously said that South Africa is ready for a female president.

119652,176274,"May’s Brexit: going it alone, hoping for an EU trade deal",Reuters,Andy Bruce,2017-01-17,2017.0,1.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-analysis-idUSKBN1512MO  ," Prime Minister Theresa May has finally outlined what Brexit really means for her: Britain going it alone, fully disentangled from the European Union while hoping the bloc will agree to a comprehensive trade deal. Britain will exit the EU’s vast internal market for goods and services and will instead try for a ”bold and ambitious” free trade agreement (FTA) rejecting the kind of arrangements some other European countries, such as Norway and Switzerland, have for trade with the world’s biggest economic region. In her speech on Tuesday, May called for a deal to be done within two years, emphasized cooperation with the bloc and called for a ” ” transition to Brexit. The value of the pound reversed recent losses and staged its biggest   rally against the U. S dollar since at least 1998. But there was a lukewarm reception from political leaders in EU countries, a reminder that agreeing the kind of trade deal May wants will be an arduous   even painful   task. ”Where is the give for all the take?” asked the Czech Republic’s secretary of state for EU affairs, Tomas Prouza, on Twitter. Ireland’s government said it was under no illusion about the scale of Brexit. May outlined 12 negotiating priorities, including limiting immigration, exiting jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, and ending full membership of the customs union that sets external tariffs for goods imported into the bloc. Aiming for a comprehensive free trade agreement (FTA) means she can enter negotiations with an almost blank canvas, largely free of politically unpopular compromises around freedom of movement or large payments into the EU’s budget. FTA CHANCE But the process of agreeing an FTA is fraught with risk. May has said she wants to agree Britain’s future relationship with the EU within two years, followed by a period of implementation. Free trade deals usually take far longer than two years to agree    Canada’s FTA with the EU will have taken seven years by the time it is expected to come into force. ”(The) prolonged uncertainty over forming agreements will present a significant challenge to the economy and one from which consumers cannot be called upon to buy our way out,” said Jagjit Chadha, director of Britain’s National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Consumer spending has been a main driver of Britain’s economy recently, with other sources of growth like trade and investment lagging. Getting rid of barriers to trade in services, the dominant sector in Britain’s economy, is also likely to be hard, although those backing Brexit argue barriers already exist within the EU. And the deeper the trade agreement, the more EU regulation Britain would have to abide by, according to the Centre for European Reform think tank. Supporters of the FTA option argue this would allow Britain to trade with the EU largely as before while also leaving it free to agree trade deals directly with other countries such as the United States, its biggest individual export partner, and emerging markets such as Brazil and India. Brexit supporters also point to Britain’s large goods deficit with the EU    a record 8. 59 billion pounds in November 2016. They say the bloc could not afford to cut it off. NUCLEAR OPTION May seems to see this as a bargaining chip, stating in her speech that no deal is better than a bad deal   effectively acknowledging that Britain could resort to World Trade Organization rules, which set upper limits on tariffs countries can impose. In such a scenario, Britain would face barriers on services, particularly in highly regulated sectors such as finance. That would be a ”very dangerous path” according to J. P. Morgan economist Malcolm Barr. ”One might expect a successful negotiating strategy to have ambitious objectives and a credible fall back position. May certainly has the former. But we doubt the prime minister has the latter,” he said in a note to clients. Tellingly, just as May was setting out her pitch for an internationalist Britain built on cooperation, her finance minister Philip Hammond told parliament that Britain could get tough if a comprehensive FTA with the EU is not forthcoming, and  slash business taxes in retaliation. ”If we don’t (get a sensible Brexit deal) the people of this country are not simply going to lie down and accept that they will be poorer,” Hammond said. ”We will do whatever it takes to maintain our competitiveness and protect our standard of living.”  (Additional reporting by Kylie MacLellan and Alistair Smout, graphic by Christian Inton, editing by William Schomberg and Peter Graff) BERLIN U.

Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis, addressing a Pentagon news conference, said he believed dozens of al Qaeda fighters were killed in the Thursday strike by manned and unmanned U. S. aircraft on an al Qaeda meeting place in the village of   Aleppo.  Davis said the U. S. military had not yet seen any credible allegations of civilian casualties, including on social media. The Pentagon released to the public the image it showed to reporters: a black and white aerial image showing the mosque still standing across the street from a building that had been reduced to rubble by the strike. Next to the charred plot where the al Qaeda militants had met was another building, which was also still intact.   ”We struck a meeting of senior al Qaeda terrorists, some of these were likely high value individuals, we’re currently assessing that,” Davis said.  But the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a   war monitoring group, said both buildings together make up the mosque. The air strikes hit the mosque complex, which consists of a center belonging to an Islamist organization and a nearby prayer area, destroying the religious center, it said. The Observatory said the strikes had killed at least 49 people and wounded dozens, mostly civilians who were attending a prayer and religious lesson at the center. In a statement following the new conference, the Pentagon said intelligence indicated that the building that was struck was a ”partially constructed community meeting hall” that was used by al Qaeda leaders ”as a place to educate and indoctrinate” militants. The statement said surveillance showed that the strike took place after evening prayers had finished. It added that the image shown to reporters was taken less five minutes after the strike.  Reuters was unable to independently verify whether the mosque may have suffered any structural damage that could be difficult to see from an aerial image. Ahrar   a powerful Syrian rebel group, on Friday said the U. S.  coalition against Islamic State was behind a deadly mosque attack near Syria’s Aleppo that a war monitor said killed dozens of people. The Observatory said jets hit around a mosque in   village near Atarib in the western part of Aleppo province, a few miles (km) from Idlib province on Thursday. The United States has been leading a coalition in an air campaign against Islamic State while also carrying out air strikes against al Qaeda in Syria, which it says sought to take advantage of the chaos from Syria’s civil war to reconstitute itself in ungoverned towns. Syrian military and Russian jets have also carried out numerous air strikes against targets in Idlib and western parts of Aleppo province, which are held by rebels seeking to oust President Bashar  . There are concerns about an increased risk of civilian casualties as U. S. President Donald Trump considers options to accelerate the fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.  According to the U. S. military, 220 civilians killed have been killed since the start of the air campaign against Islamic State in 2014, but that estimate is far lower than those provided by monitoring groups.

121407,179904,"Russian police detain opposition leader, hundreds of protesters",Reuters,Denis Pinchuk and Natalia Shurmina,2017-03-27,2017.0,3.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-protests-idUSKBN16X0G8?il=0  ," Police detained hundreds of protesters across Russia on Sunday, including opposition leader Alexei Navalny, after thousands took to the streets to demonstrate against corruption and demand the resignation of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. The protests, reckoned to be the biggest since a wave of   demonstrations in   come a year before a presidential election that Vladimir Putin is expected to contest, running for what would be a fourth term. Opinion polls suggest the liberal opposition, which Navalny represents, has little chance of fielding a candidate capable of unseating Putin, who enjoys high ratings. But Navalny and his supporters hope to channel public discontent over official corruption to attract more support. A Reuters reporter saw police detain Navalny, who hopes to run against Putin, as he walked along central Moscow’s Tverskaya Street with supporters, part of an unsanctioned rally as a police helicopter circled overhead.  Police put Navalny in a truck around which hundreds of protesters crowded, trying to open its doors. ”I’m happy that so many people came out (onto the streets) from the east (of the country) to Moscow,” Navalny said, moments before he was detained.  The Kremlin said on Friday that plans for the central Moscow protest, which the city’s authorities had rejected, were an illegal provocation. The United States condemned the arrests, saying the action was an affront to democratic values. ”We call on the government of Russia to immediately release all peaceful protesters,” State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement, adding that Washington was ”troubled” to hear of the arrest of Navalny. SEVERAL HUNDRED DETAINED Grigory Okhotin, one of the founders of OVD Info, a human rights organization that monitors detentions, said around 600 people had been detained in Moscow on Sunday. Police said around 7, 000 to 8, 000 people were on Tverskaya Street and surrounding areas by   and put the number of detentions by late afternoon at around 500. As evening drew in, hundreds of riot police lined up on Manezh Square at the end of Tverskaya Street and drove protesters away from the Kremlin’s walls. Some opposition supporters on Manezh Square shouted: ”Putin is a thief” as tourists wandered nearby. Navalny called the protests after publishing allegations that Medvedev, the prime minister and former president, had amassed a huge fortune that far outstripped his official salary. Medvedev’s spokeswoman called the allegations ”propagandistic attacks” unworthy of detailed comment and said they amounted to   posturing by Navalny.  Elsewhere, at a rally in the far eastern city of Vladivostok, a Reuters reporter saw 30 people being detained after unfurling banners reading: ”The prime minister should answer”. ”I’ve come out (to protest) against corruption and want the authorities to answer the accusations in the Navalny film,”    student Denis Korneev said at the Moscow protest.  ”In many countries the government would have resigned over this.” Witnesses told Reuters that four people were also detained at a rally in Yekaterinburg in the industrial Urals region. On Yekaterinburg’s Labour Square, protesters waved posters reading: ”We are the authorities here” while nationalists and supporters of the   United Russia party looked on.  Local media reported that large protests also took place in other cities, including St Petersburg and Novosibirsk. State media broadly ignored Sunday’s protests.

The killings took place two days after a university professor was slain in similar fashion on Saturday in an attack claimed by Islamic State. Five or six assailants went to the apartment of Xulhaz Mannan, 35, an editor of Rupban, Bangladesh’s first magazine for gay, bisexual and transgender people, and attacked him and a friend with sharp weapons, Dhaka city police spokesman Maruf Hossain Sordar said. They entered the apartment disguised as couriers, he said, quoting witnesses. The assailants also wounded a security guard. Witnesses said the attackers shouted ”Allahu Akbar” (”God is greatest)” as they fled the scene. Mannan was employed by the U. S. embassy, working for the U. S. Agency for International Development, the State Department in Washington said. State Department spokesman John Kirby said the United States was ”outraged” by the ”barbaric attack.” He called Mannan, ”a beloved member of our embassy family and a courageous advocate for LGBTI rights   human rights, actually.”   ”LGBTI” stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual and intersex. A spokesman for the White House’s National Security Council, Ned Price, said the United States strongly urged the Bangladeshi government to ensure the perpetrators were brought to justice. Other attacks took place in the country on Monday, but it was not immediately clear whether those assaults were carried out by Islamist militants. Two men on a motorcycle shot dead a former prison guard in front of Kashimpur jail, on the outskirts of Dhaka, said Khandakar Rezaul Hasan, chief of the local police station. A teacher was hacked to death in the southwestern district of Kustia, police said. The   nation of 160 million people has seen a surge in violent attacks over the past few months in which liberal activists, members of minority Muslim sects and other religious groups have been targeted. Five secular bloggers and a publisher have been hacked to death in Bangladesh since February 2015.  A group affiliated with al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the killing of a liberal Bangladeshi blogger this month. Islamic State has also claimed responsibility for the killings of two foreigners and attacks on mosques and Christian priests in Bangladesh since September. The government has denied that Islamic State or al Qaeda groups have a presence in the country and said homegrown Islamist radicals are behind the attacks.  At least five militants have been killed in shootouts since November as security forces have stepped up a crackdown on Islamist militants looking to establish a Muslim state based on sharia, or Islamic religious law.

126563,189154,The small cap squeeze: When more money chases fewer companies,Reuters,Chuck Mikolajczak and John McCrank,2016-05-10,2016.0,5.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-smallcap-liquidity-idUSKCN0Y11EQ  ," Shares of small companies have always traded at a premium on Wall Street, where investors have historically been rewarded for taking chances on the sometimes   stocks. But traders complain that the risks are getting higher and the rewards harder to reap as fewer small companies come to market and investors throw money at them almost indiscriminately via   exchange traded funds. The combination of those two factors has cut into what experts call liquidity   the ability of investors to trade at a desirable price at any given time.      Traders at Hodges Fund, T. Rowe Price and other investment firms say the lack of liquidity in small company stocks has forced them to spread sales over weeks instead of minutes, eat higher trading costs, buy higher, sell lower and hire their own liquidity specialists to deal with the challenges. At times, they have been shut out of shares of companies they wanted to acquire, they say.    Individual investors who buy   mutual funds have been paying the price, too.   companies have underperformed large cap companies over the last six years, an unusual lag during a period of market expansion, according to data from Morningstar. Yet shares of small companies are far more expensive, relative to their earnings, than those of bigger companies. So far this year they are selling at an 86. 2 percent premium over large companies; a 32. 7 percent spread is more typical.  ”What you’re seeing now are big swings often on no news on   equities on a daily basis and it’s not uncommon for something to move up 5 or 10 percent on seemingly meaningless news,” said Whitney George, chairman of Sprott USA, an asset management company.  Liquidity in the   end of the stock market has been deteriorating for years. But two factors have made that worse:  With more startups staying private or selling themselves outright to larger companies, there are fewer new small company stocks on exchanges. The authoritative and imprecisely named Wilshire 5000 index, which claims to hold ”all U. S. equities with readily available prices,” covers just over 3, 700 companies, near its   low. Meanwhile, investments in   mutual funds and exchange traded funds have exploded. U. S.  domestic equity ETFs now sit on $1. 3 trillion in assets; they had $288 billion in 2006. Since 2007, assets have almost quadrupled in   index ETFs, which often are required to buy or sell stocks in their target index regardless of price and may be squeezing out other traders. Small companies with high ETF ownership have lower liquidity than similar companies without big ETF play, according to a 2014 study by Sophia Hamm, an assistant professor at Ohio State University. Since 2008,   stocks have traded at   spreads eight times as wide as the spreads of large company stocks, according to Ana Avramovic, analyst for Credit Suisse Trading Strategy in New York. Before 2008 they more typically traded at spreads five times as wide. Even small trades can create exaggerated price moves and force fund managers to decide between an undesirable price or a    position.  ”We go in and we start buying it and within a day or two the stock moves and runs away from us,” said Eric Marshall, research director at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. ”We want to have a 1 percent or 2 percent position in that stock and we end up with a    position,” he said, meaning 0. 25 percent.  Selling when everyone is dumping a stock can be even more fraught. Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco, says he sometimes does not buy as much as he would like of a specific company because he fears not being able to sell it when he wants to. He recently limited a biotech stock purchase to about half of what he might otherwise buy because ”I wanted a manageable position when it came time to sell” so he would not get stuck with unsold shares.  Fund companies have turned to more sophisticated strategies to place their trades   bunching them into earnings reporting season days when there is more trading than usual and turning to   private marketplaces known as ”dark pools.”  Stuart George, head of equity trading for Delaware Investment, which manages about $166 billion, said his firm uses ” ”   spreading trades out throughout a day and sometimes, more than a day. Some   trades of small cap stocks can take as long as several weeks, he said.  At T. Rowe Price, trader Chris Carlson said he clumps his   trades at the end of the day, when liquidity improves as funds have to settle their accounts and price their portfolios. Nonetheless, he said he finds himself spending a few more cents per share for many of his small company trades. The lack of liquidity and outsized stock moves can be problematic for the issuing companies as well, according to Tim Quast, president of Modern Networks IR in Denver, which does data analytics and works on behalf of public companies. When low volume   a company’s share price, its treasurer cannot use the equity market as a barometer of value, or even attract investors who may stick to stocks with ample trades. For example, Kevin Mahn, a portfolio manager and chief investment officer at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, said that because he invests only in companies with adequate liquidity, he tends to stay away from the smallest 700 or so companies in the Russell 2000 small cap stock index. ”I don’t go into the microcap names,” he said.

126668,189301,Monsanto boss could net $70 million from a Bayer takeover,Reuters,"Pamela Barbaglia, Tom Bergin and Anjuli Davies",2016-05-27,2016.0,5.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-monsanto-m-a-bayer-payout-idUSKCN0YI1W9  ," Monsanto boss Hugh Grant could land more than $70 million if the world’s largest seed company is taken over by German chemicals giant Bayer AG ( ).  The U. S. firm said it was open to engaging in further negotiations with Bayer after turning down its $62 billion bid as ”incomplete and financially inadequate” this week. That $   offer would allow CEO and Chairman Grant to walk away with a total package of more than $123 million after a takeover, including from the sale of shares and the exercise of options he already owned, a Reuters analysis of Monsanto filings shows.  But $73. 5 million of that represents gains the    Scot could make as a result of the Bayer courtship, largely thanks to increases in the value of his stock options.  The gains also reflect the rise in the value of his shareholdings and accelerated payout of bonuses that would occur if there is a takeover, as well as a $14. 5 million ”golden parachute” severance payment he would receive if he loses his job as a result. There is no certainty that ongoing negotiations will result into a deal although Monsanto’s board has signaled interest in reaching an accord with Bayer. Grant, who is eligible for retirement, said his company firmly endorsed ”the substantial benefits an integrated strategy could provide to growers and broader society” after the bid was snubbed on Tuesday. Even should a deal be struck, it is not certain that Grant would be ousted. But in most takeovers, the CEOs of the targets tend to exit after their companies are sold. The agrochemicals   between Dow Chemical ( ) and Dupont ( ) agreed in December   an unusual case because it was billed as a ”merger of equals” of two companies of roughly equal size   will see both CEOs depart.  Grant’s exposure to shares and options means he has an incentive to hold out for the highest possible sale price in any deal, which would not only be in the interests of shareholders but also increase the value of his holdings. A $   bid, for example, would lift his holdings by another $12 million, the Reuters analysis shows.  A spokesman for St   Monsanto declined to comment on its compensation scheme.     PAYDAY The company   which makes the world’s most widely used herbicide, Roundup   has been wrestling with low crop prices and spending cutbacks by U. S. farmers, which have hit its profits. Before reports about a potential Bayer bid in early May, Monsanto’s shares were trading at around $90. At that price, Grant’s share options were worth around $1 million. At $   they are worth over $49 million. Other top executives would also benefit from a takeover.     Brett Begemann, president and chief operating officer, could walk away with a total of $36. 5 million for his shares and in gains on his options, accelerated bonuses and severance, should a deal be done at $   and his job terminated. Such an accord would make him about $20 million better off than he was based on the   share price. The other three directors whose total pay is disclosed in filings   Chief Financial Officer Pierre Courduroux, Chief Technology Officer Robert Fraley and General Counsel, David Snively   could walk away with a total of over $56 million in shares, bonuses and severance if a deal goes through.    Any merger of Bayer’s agrochemicals operations with Monsanto’s would be the second ” ” in the industry in recent months after the creation of DowDuPont, a $130 billion giant.  The departing CEOs of Dow Chemical and DuPont will walk away with a combined $80 million.  Dow’ Andrew Liveris will get $52. 8 million in cash, stock and other payments, including about $40 million he is already entitled to on his retirement, DowDuPont said in a regulatory filing. DuPont’s Edward Breen will get $27. 2 million, DowDuPont said.

127229,190217,Google executive quits self-driving car project,Reuters,Paul Lienert and David Shepardson,2016-08-06,2016.0,8.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-urmson-idUSKCN10G2EH  ,"Alphabet Inc’s Google had named Urmson chief technical officer of the project after it hired former Hyundai executive John Krafcik to be chief executive of the project. Urmson, who joined the project when it was launched and has been a public face of Google’s autonomous vehicle efforts,  testified before a U. S. Senate panel on autonomous cars in March. Krafcik confirmed Urmson’s departure in a tweet on Friday afternoon. Urmson, in a blog post late Friday, said he was ”ready for a fresh challenge.” He said he was not sure what he would do next. ”Going to take some time and get some perspective from outside of Google,” he wrote in a text message to Reuters. Urmson told Reuters earlier this year that   cars are coming. ”I’ve gone from hoping this would happen to thinking it might happen to knowing it will happen,” Urmson said. Google   car project spokesman Johnny Luu confirmed Urmson’s departure and praised him. ”Seven years ago, the idea that a car could drive itself wasn’t much more than an idea. Chris has been a vital force for the project, helping the team move from a research phase to a point where this   technology will soon become a reality,” Luu said. Google’s project has had other significant departures, even as it has hired dozens of new employees. Earlier this year, Anthony Levandowski, who was product manager for Google’s   car program, left the project to   a startup with two other former Google employees. Google’s   car project is expected to become a standalone company this year. In July, the project appointed its first general counsel. Google has logged more than 1. 8 million miles of autonomous driving in testing in Texas, California, Arizona and Washington state. It has said it has no timetable for making   vehicles available to the public. Officials have said Google is preparing to make its   car unit a separate company. The program is now part of its X research laboratory unit. ”The   car project is in the middle of graduating from X and this is sort of a gradual process,” Astro Teller, who heads the X program, told NBC News in April. In May, Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said they had agreed to work together to build a fleet of nearly 100   minivans, the first time a Silicon Valley firm had teamed up with a traditional carmaker to develop an autonomous vehicle. In March, Reuters reported Google’s   car team was expanding and hiring more people with automotive industry expertise, underscoring the company’s determination to move the division past the experimental stage.

127792,191169,A new worry for Clinton: Trump’s struggles may depress Democratic voter turnout,Reuters,James Oliphant,2016-10-11,2016.0,10.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-clinton-message-analysis-idUSKCN12A2J3  ," Hillary Clinton’s campaign is confronting an emerging risk to her presidential ambitions   if Donald Trump continues to trail her in opinion polls many Democrats may simply stay at home on Election Day. Without enough popular support, Clinton would enter the White House lacking the political capital she would need to drive through her agenda. In the   scenario it could cost her the presidency if Republicans turn out in big numbers on Nov. 8.      Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has spent much of her campaign sounding the alarm over the prospect of a President Trump. She has struggled to lay out a compelling vision for her presidency and has failed to excite key constituencies, including millennials, minority voters and liberal Democrats. Opinion polls show that many voters are backing Clinton primarily to stop Trump, the Republican nominee, from getting into the White House. If they believe he has no hope of winning, then what would their motivation be to turn up at the polls?  In a recent   poll about half of all Clinton supporters said they were backing her to keep Trump from winning. By contrast, just 36. 5 percent said it was because of Clinton’s policies and just 12. 6 percent said it was because they like her personally.  “Turnout is correlated with levels of competition,” said Michael McDonald, an elections expert at the University of Florida. “The higher the competition, the higher the turnout. ” The young Americans, blacks, Latinos, and   voters who make up much of the Democratic base often need to feel motivated by a particular candidate or issue to turn out, McDonald said, as was the case with President Barack Obama’s candidacy in 2008.  Clinton’s campaign has long worried about voter complacency and has at every turn pushed the notion that the race is close and that Trump is unfit to be president. With her lead growing, that task grows more difficult. A     survey (carried out before Friday’s release of a video tape in which Trump makes vulgar remarks about women) gave the Democratic nominee a 95 percent chance of winning the election. An   Street Journal poll on Monday showed Clinton with an   lead nationally over Trump. Low Democratic voter turnout could leave Trump an opening in swing states. And should Clinton win the election, a slim margin of victory could compound the challenge she will face in trying to govern a deeply divided nation.  Clinton’s campaign, however, will be able to rely on an extensive and   voter mobilization effort, one that is expected to give her an edge over Trump’s smaller organization.  MOVING PAST TRUMP The Clinton campaign insisted on Monday the race will remain tight. It sent out a new fundraising pitch to supporters, contending that Trump is “an authoritarian threat” for saying at Sunday’s presidential debate that she would be in jail if he was president.  Clinton must also contend with anger among liberal Democrats over leaked excerpts of paid speeches she made to banks and big business. The excerpts appeared to confirm their fears about her support for global trade and tendency to cozy up to Wall Street. Some liberals have also been waiting for Clinton to make a more positive case for her own presidency. “This election cannot be just a referendum on Donald Trump,” said Arun Chaudhury, creative director of Revolution Messaging, a   consulting firm that oversaw the online media operation of former Clinton rival, Senator Bernie Sanders.  Clinton’s central message, he said, has been that “everyone has to step up and stop Donald Trump from being president, not step up and make Hillary Clinton president. ”  “The best campaign messages are comparative in nature,” said Ben Turchin, a Democratic pollster who worked for Sanders’ campaign. “She can win by a bigger margin by giving a little more of an affirmative case for her presidency. ” While Clinton frequently goes on the attack against Trump, calling him racist, sexist and dangerous, her campaign insists it has been trying to get a positive,   message out. “It is hard in this campaign when you’re running against him and he generates so much controversy and therefore headlines,” Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton’s communications director, told Reuters. “It’s hard to break through on any one day, and that’s why we just have to keep at it. ” The two candidates’ central campaign slogans reflect their differing appeals to the electorate. Where Trump’s is the   “Make America Great Again,” Clinton’s is a more stolid “Stronger Together,” which speaks to rallying existing Democratic voters around her candidacy   and is a harder sell.  Clinton’s campaign seems to have recognized the need for some adjustments to its message.  Since the presidential race intensified last month, Clinton has returned to the style of campaigning that helped her win early states in the Democratic nominating contests, holding smallish events focused on issues of most concern to core Democratic constituencies such as women and young voters.  Turchin, the former Sanders pollster, said Clinton’s efforts at fashioning a positive message were improving, although she is still having difficulty attracting the support of      voters, among others.  ”You’ve got to make the hard case over and over again,” he said. ”She’s got to convince people she shares their values. ”  (Reporting by James Oliphant, Amanda Becker, Chris Kahn, and Emily Stephenson.

128484,192484,Iraqi forces fighting Islamic State say nearing Mosul airport,Reuters,Babak Dehghanpisheh and Ahmed Rasheed,2016-11-05,2016.0,11.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-town-idUSKBN1300EK  ," Iraqi security forces drove Islamic State fighters from the center of a town just south of the militants’ main stronghold of Mosul on Saturday and reached within a few km (miles) of an airport on the edge of the city, a senior commander said.   Raed Shakir Jawdat said security forces were in control of the center of Hammam   about 15 km (10 miles) south of Mosul, although he did not say whether the militants had been pushed out completely. The advance on the southern front comes days after Iraqi special forces fought their way into the eastern side of Mosul, taking control of six neighborhoods according to Iraqi officials and restoring a foothold in the city for the first time since the army retreated ignominiously two years ago. Another unit advanced further north up the western bank of the Tigris river on Saturday, Jawdat added. ”Our elite forces have reached an area just 4 km (2   miles) from Mosul airport,” he told   television channel. Recapturing Mosul would crush the Iraqi half of a caliphate declared by Islamic State leader Abu Bakr   from the pulpit of a Mosul mosque in 2014. His Islamist group also controls large parts of east Syria. There were no reports of further gains in the east of the city on Saturday, and officers said the military was clearing areas it took in recent days. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider   speaking on a visit to the eastern front, said he brought ”a message to the residents inside Mosul who are hostages in the hands of Daesh (Islamic State)   we will liberate you soon”. Abadi said progress in the nearly    campaign, and the advance into Mosul itself, had been faster than expected. But in the face of fierce resistance, which has included suicide car bombings, sniper fire and roadside bombs, he suggested that progress may be intermittent.  ”Our heroic forces will not retreat and will not be broken. Maybe in the face of terrorist acts, criminal acts, there will be some delay,” he said. General Jawdat said his forces had destroyed 17   cars which had targeted them on their advance north. So far the army controls only a small part of Mosul which was home to 2 million people before Islamic State took over in 2014. More than 1 million remain in the city   by far the largest under Islamic State control in either Iraq or Syria. A Reuters correspondent in the village of Ali Rash, about 7 km (4 miles) southeast of the city, saw smoke rising from eastern districts on Saturday, while air strikes, artillery and gunfire could be heard. The United Nations has warned of a possible exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees. So far only 31, 000 have been displaced, of which more than 3, 000 have already returned to their homes, said William Lacy Swing, head of the International Organization for Migration.  ”The numbers are not as large so far as had been expected. We’d heard figures all the way up to 500, 000 or 700, 000,” he told Reuters.  ”We’re trying to prepare accordingly, but it’s very difficult to do contingency planning with any level of accuracy because we don’t know what they’re going to find when they get inside”.  LAST TOWN BEFORE MOSUL The assault on Hammam   about 15 km (10 miles) south of Mosul, targeted a force of at least 70 Islamic State fighters there, commander of the Mosul operations   Najm   said. Jabouri said the assault began around 10 a. m. (0700 GMT) and some militants had tried to escape across the river, although others put up heavy resistance and the troops had thwarted three attempted suicide car bombings. ”(The battle) is very important   it’s the last town for us before Mosul,” Jabouri told reporters. Iraqi helicopters were supporting the army, he said, backed also by jets from a U. S.  air coalition. He said the jihadists were using hundreds of people as human shields, although it was not clear how many civilians were left in the town. Before Islamic State swept in more than two years ago, Hammam   and outlying villages had a population of 65, 000. As well as forcing residents to stay as they came under attack in Hammam   Islamic State fighters retreating north in the last two weeks have forced thousands to march with them as cover from air strikes, villagers have told Reuters. The United Nations said the militants transported 1, 600 abducted civilians from Hammam   to the town of Tal Afar, west of Mosul, on Tuesday and took another 150 families from the town to Mosul the next day. They told residents to hand over children, especially boys aged over nine, in an apparent recruitment drive for child soldiers, U. N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said. Jabouri said a man he described as a senior Islamic State figure, Ammar Salih Ahmed Abu Bakr, was killed by federal police   who are fighting with the army in Hammam     as he tried to escape by car. Many of the remaining militants were   he said. ”There are at least 70 Daesh fighters in the town. The majority are foreign fighters, so they don’t know where to go. They are just moving from place to place.”  (Additional reporting by Stephen Kalin in Ali Rash and Ahmed Rasheed in Baghdad; Writing by Dominic Evans; Editing by Catherine Evans and Alexander Smith) UNITED NATIONS The United States cautioned on Wednesday it was ready to use force if need be to stop North Korea’s nuclear missile program but said it preferred global diplomatic action against Pyongyang for defying world powers by test launching a ballistic missile that could hit Alaska.

Donald Trump on Thursday said for the first time that he supports the completion of a pipeline project near a North Dakota Indian reservation, which has been the subject of months of protests by tribes and environmentalists.  A communications briefing from Trump’s transition team said despite media reports that Trump owns a stake in Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the pipeline, Trump’s support of the pipeline ”has nothing to do with his personal investments and everything to do with promoting policies that benefit all Americans.”   ”Those making such a claim are only attempting to distract from the fact that   Trump has put forth serious policy proposals he plans to set in motion on Day One,” said the daily briefing note sent to campaign supporters and congressional staff. Activists have spent months protesting plans to route the $3. 8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, saying the project poses a threat to water resources and sacred Native American sites. On Thursday, U. S. military veterans were arriving at a camp to join thousands of activists braving snow and freezing temperatures to protest the pipeline.

129469,194364,"Twin bombing outside Istanbul soccer stadium kills 29, wounds 166",Reuters,Humeyra Pamuk and Murad Sezer,2016-12-11,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-blast-idUSKBN13Z0QS  ," Two bombs exploded less than a minute apart, killing 29 people and wounding 166 outside a soccer stadium in Istanbul on Saturday night, in a   attack on police shortly after a match between two of Turkey’s top teams. First a car bomb exploded outside the Vodafone Arena, home to Istanbul’s Besiktas soccer team, leaving flaming wreckage on the street.   seconds later, a suspect wearing explosives detonated them while surrounded by police in an adjacent park, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told a news conference. President Tayyip Erdogan described the blasts as a terrorist attack on police and civilians. He said the aim of the bombings, two hours after the end of a match attended by thousands of people, had been to cause the maximum number of casualties. ”Nobody should doubt that with God’s will, we as a country and a nation will overcome terror, terrorist organisations . .. and the forces behind them,” he said in a statement. The attack shook a   nation still trying to recover from a series of deadly bombings this year in cities including Istanbul and the capital Ankara, some blamed on the Islamic State jihadist group and others claimed by Kurdish militants. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But the blasts came less than a week after Islamic State urged its supporters to target Turkey’s ”security, military, economic and media establishment”. ”It was like hell. The flames went all the way up to the sky. I was drinking tea at the cafe next to the mosque,” said Omer Yilmaz, who works as a cleaner at the nearby Dolmabahce mosque, directly across the road from the stadium. ”People ducked under the tables, women began crying. Football fans drinking tea at the cafe sought shelter, it was horrible,” he told Reuters. Turkey is a member of the NATO military alliance and part of the U. S.  coalition against Islamic State. It launched a military incursion into Syria in August against the radical Islamist group. It is also fighting a Kurdish militant insurgency in its own southeast. VICTIMS MAINLY POLICE Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said the first explosion, which came around two hours after the end of the match between Besiktas and Bursaspor, was at an assembly point for riot police officers. The second came as police surrounded the suicide bomber in the nearby Macka park. Two of those killed in the blasts were civilians. The other 27 were police officers, including a police chief and another senior officer, Soylu said. He said 17 of the wounded were undergoing surgery and another six were in intensive care. Soylu also said 10 people had been detained based on evidence from the detonated vehicle, but gave no indication of who the authorities thought might be behind the attack. A Reuters photographer said many riot police officers were seriously wounded. Armed police sealed off streets. A police water cannon doused the wreckage of a   car and there were two separate fires on the road outside the stadium. Bursaspor said none of its fans appeared to have been injured.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg condemned what he described as ”horrific acts of terror” while European leaders also sent messages of solidarity. The United States condemned the attack and said it stood with its NATO ally. The bombings come five months after Turkey was shaken by a failed military coup, in which more than 240 people were killed, many of them in Istanbul, as rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and fighter jets in a bid to seize power. Istanbul has seen several other attacks this year, including in June, when around 45 people were killed and hundreds wounded as three suspected Islamic State militants carried out a gun and bomb attack on its main Ataturk airport.

130092,195651,Democrats should write their own “terrific” Obamacare replacement,Vox,Matthew Yglesias,2017/1/11,2017.0,1.0,http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/11/14223470/progressive-obamacare-alternative-public-option," Donald Trump promised Americans “something terrific” in place of Obamacare, but it’s simply not possible to replace it with something that’s better for most people unless you violate the core tenets of conservative ideology. At times on the campaign trail, Trump suggested that he was, in fact, prepared to violate core tenets of conservative ideology. That’s one thing some of the voters who picked him liked about him. And while he’s done little since Election Day to suggest that he intends to follow through on that promise, there’s no reason Democrats can’t do it for him.     Nobody in the party believed the 2010 law was the last word on health reform, and nobody in the party needs to be constrained by the core tenets of conservative ideology.  By stitching together bits and pieces of Trump’s rhetoric with various improvement proposals offered over the years by the Obama administration and the Clinton campaign, Democrats can and should devise an affordable replacement scheme that moves the country closer to the   system they mostly agree would be theoretically superior.  The ACA is good, but it could be better The core reason to do this is that while Republicans have utterly failed to come up with a plan that actually improved on the problems they’ve identified with the Affordable Care Act, the problems themselves are real enough.     Here is Mitch McConnell, speaking to CBS on Sunday, describing the problems with the status quo:    Well, what you need to understand is that there are 25 million Americans who aren’t covered now. If the idea behind Obamacare was to get everyone covered, that’s one of the many failures, in addition to premiums going up, copayments going up, deductibles going up. And many Americans who actually did get insurance when they did not have it before have really bad insurance that they have to pay for, and the deductibles are so high that it’s really not worth much to them. So it is chaotic. The status quo is simply unacceptable. McConnell reiterated these complaints in a Monday   but as Ezra Klein writes, McConnell “refuses to say whether he will insist that any Republican replacement actually fix these problems. ”    He refuses to say because the answer, of course, is no. The GOP commitment to tax cuts for   regulations and tax cuts for millionaires makes it impossible for them to deliver anything useful to the 99 percent.  But that doesn’t make the complaints wrong. There are some exchanges that feature robust competition, and they are working a lot better than the exchanges that lack it. Bringing more competition to those troubled   exchanges would be valuable and important. So would doing more to keep premiums and deductibles in check. And while these things aren’t doable within the ideological framework of the modern American conservative movement, that simply goes to show that the ideological framework of the modern American conservative movement is cramped and ridiculous. So much so that the GOP’s own   kept rejecting it in the middle of a Republican Party primary, only to later embrace unity to secure the support of GOP donors during the general election. Trumpy principles for a progressive replacement The key to forging a sound Democratic Party replacement for the Affordable Care Act is to start with the wise words of Donald Trump. Unfortunately, that means taking the health care plan he promised on his website and throwing it in the garbage. That plan would cause 21 million Americans to lose their health insurance while depriving tens of millions more of critical regulatory protections. That’s not “terrific. ”    But when doing things he actually cares about, like tweeting or going on television, he espouses very different views.   I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid. Huckabee copied me. —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2015    Protecting Medicare and Medicaid means you can’t repeal two core elements of the Affordable Care Act. You can’t scrap the Medicaid expansion, and you can’t scrap the payment reforms to Medicare. You’re left then only to talk about the “core” Affordable Care Act marketplaces, marketplaces that are successfully delivering affordable care to millions but that are still short of enrollment and competition goals.  Trump is, obviously, not a detailed policy thinker. But in a September 2015 interview with 60 Minutes, he laid out some core principles (emphasis added):  TRUMP: I am going to take care of everybody. I don’t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody’s going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now. SCOTT PELLEY: The uninsured person is going to be taken care of. How? How? TRUMP: They’re going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. And, you know what, if this is probably  —   PELLEY: Make a deal? Who pays for it? TRUMP:  —   the government’s gonna pay for it. But we’re going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most it’s going to be a private plan, and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition, with lots of competitors, with great companies, and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything.  Trump, in short, campaigned on the same basic principle as Bernie Sanders  —   health care needs to be a right rather than a privilege. But he didn’t go all the way to endorsing a     system. Even earlier in the campaign, at an August 2015 debate, Trump observed that   “works in Canada,” and ”it works incredibly well in Scotland,” and “it could have worked in a different age” in the United States. But it would be too disruptive to interfere with people’s current   arrangements and try to shift everyone to a   system.  Fortunately, a sound middle ground is available.  The version of the public option included in the House Progressive Caucus budget would reduce federal health spending by $218 billion over 10 years, by taking advantage of Medicare’s greater bargaining power.  Clinton’s campaign outlined three proposals to reduce premiums and    costs that the RAND Corporation assessed would reduce the ranks of the uninsured by a further 10 million while “decreasing average spending by up to 33 percent for those with moderately low incomes. ” Clinton’s benefit enhancements would cost $90 million, a small fraction of the $218 billion the public option would save.  The additional $120 billion or so could simply be allocated to the Medicare Trust Fund, contributing to further extending its life.  Last, while there is considerable debate as to the practical impact of Trump’s proposal to eliminate the “lines between the states” and establish a unified federal market in health insurance plans, it seems like an idea worth trying. In the context of a Republican    plan, eliminating the “lines” would be a de facto total deregulation of the insurance industry. But relying on the Affordable Care Act regulatory minimums while allowing insurers to operate in as many (or few) states as they like seems desirable.   You could, of course, also throw some other favorite progressive ideas into the mix, like a Medicare   for people over the age of 55 (though a good public option should make this unnecessary) steps to speed the approval of generic drugs, or the use of more aggressive pharmaceutical price negotiating techniques by Medicare.     Call it whatever you like These and other ideas are longstanding   items that have been floating around in various corners of the Democratic Party. You could, in theory, bundle them up with something technocratically sound but unpopular like a stronger individual mandate, or you could throw in something   like relaxing the employer mandate. Replacing the “Cadillac Tax” on expensive health insurance premiums (a policy labor unions hate) with a 28 percent cap on the deductibility of health insurance would probably also make sense here.  But the great thing about all these ideas is that they’re consistent with both longstanding Democratic ideas and popular things Donald Trump said on the campaign trail. Democrats can characterize them as Affordable Care Act “fixes” or “tweaks” or “improvements” if they want to. Or they can call it an “alternative” or “replacement” to the ACA if that sounds better. Heck, they can even call it “Trumpcare. ”  The important thing is that devising a plan would make two points. On the one hand, it would show that Democrats are not indifferent to the fact that the ACA has not been roses and unicorns for everyone. On the other hand, it would show that Obama’s challenge to the GOP to show him something demonstrably better for patients is honestly not that hard a standard to meet.  Republicans can’t do it not because they’re stupid or because it’s conceptually impossible. They can’t do it because they are ideologically rigid and obsessed with cutting taxes and deregulating business. Trump himself will then be challenged to either demonstrate continued fealty to his adoptive political party’s narrow ideology or deliver on his campaign pledge to show flexibility and deliver something “terrific. ” Either way, it’ll be a win.

131060,197345,Trump’s response to an atrocity in Syria: talk tough and blame Obama,Vox,Zack Beauchamp,2017/4/5,2017.0,4.0,http://www.vox.com/world/2017/4/5/15189820/trump-response-atrocity-syria-blame-obama," During a Wednesday press conference, President Trump gave some uncharacteristically harsh comments about Bashar  ’s government in Syria. The president claimed Assad’s gas attack on Tuesday, which killed at least 74 people, “had a big impact on me,” and that “it’s very possible  …    that my attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed. ”    This paired well with tough talk from his ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, who gave an impassioned speech at the UN on Wednesday asking ”how many more children have to die before Russia cares?”  —   a clear dig at Russian President Vladimir Putin, Assad’s primary overseas backer (and an autocrat Trump openly admires). ”It crossed a lot of lines for me,” Trump told reporters at the White House at the White House. ”When you kill innocent children, innocent babies, babies, little babies, with a chemical gas that is so lethal, people were shocked to hear what gas it was, that crosses many, many lines, beyond a red line. Many, many lines.” But Trump’s harsh condemnation of Assad came with an important caveat: a new dig at President Barack Obama, who Trump blamed for setting the stage for the new attack by failing to use force against Assad after the Syrian dictator first used chemical weapons in 2013.       ”I think the Obama administration had a great opportunity to solve this crisis a long time ago when he said the red line in the sand,” Trump said at the White House. ”And when he didn’t cross that line after making the threat, I think that set us back a long ways, not only in Syria, but in many other parts of the world, because it was a blank threat. I think it was something that was not one of our better days as a country.”    The comment highlighted the difficult and perhaps untenable line Trump is trying to tread as he steps up his condemnations of Assad while ignoring the fact that his administration doesn’t seem ready to do more than Obama had done    and that he, before joining the 2016 race, had actually made clear that he believed using force in Syria would be a mistake. For one thing, Trump’s policy towards Syria has thus far failed to include any new diplomatic or military measures against the Assad regime. On March 30, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seemed to dismiss the longtime US goal of seeing Assad leave power, saying “I think the longer term status of President Assad will be decided by the Syrian people. ”  Trump did not call for Assad to step down on Wednesday, suggesting Tillerson’s policy stands even despite the president’s stated horror at the chemical attack.    Moreover, the harsh line from the Trump team seems to imply that President Trump would have attacked Syria after Assad’s similar chemical attack 2013. That ignores the fact that at the time, Trump demanded that Obama back down from his “red line”  —   and stay the hell out of Syria:   AGAIN, TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA   IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U. S. GETS NOTHING! —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2013    And did so again:   The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement. Do NOT attack Syria, fix U. S. A. —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2013    And again:   If Obama attacks Syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed, he and the U. S. will look very bad! —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2013    And over and over again:   For all of those fools that want to attack Syria, the U. S. has lost the vital element of     be a disaster! —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2013      Russia is sending a fleet of ships to the Mediterranean. Obama’s war in Syria has the potential to widen into a worldwide conflict. —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2013      The Arab League stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on Syria, but they want us to attack. Are our leaders insane or just stupid —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 2, 2013      What I am saying is stay out of Syria. —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2013    The issue here isn’t just hypocrisy. Trump’s actual policy on Syria thus far has been a more honest expression of Obama’s, which was to effectively take no real measure to oust Assad despite continuing to insist that he needed to leave power. Beyond failing to enforce his red line, my colleague Jennifer Williams noted that Obama had personally vetoed the advice of his entire national security team in 2012 and opted not to arm the moderate Syrian rebels when they were scoring significant battlefield wins against Assad.     Still, Obama was at least prepared to use the moral authority of his office to speak out against Assad’s human rights violations and willingness to slaughter hundreds of thousands of his own people. Trump’s actual policy and response to the 2013 chemical weapons attack suggests that, despite his vague expressions of horror in Wednesday’s presser, he’s not actually interested in taking this kind moral stand. The paradox of America’s Syria policy Ever since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, it has been one of the hardest foreign policy problems the United States has faced  —   one that has deeply divided civilian policymakers, senior US military officials, and foreign policy experts from both parties. On the one hand, failing to directly intervene with US firepower has allowed Assad to carry out massacres with impunity and to send the conflict’s death toll up to at least 470, 000. On the other, there is no guarantee that a US intervention would have stopped the slaughter. And as we saw after the Iraq War, intervention could have created a dangerous vacuum even if it succeeded in toppling Assad. Obama personally decided that the former was the safer bet, clearly committing to   after the 2013 “red line” debacle. This is a defensible choice, albeit one with a clear  : The Syrian civil war continued unabated; more people have died; and the Assad regime, with direct Russian military aid, has steadily reconquered large swaths of the country. Yet team Obama continued insisting that Assad needed to give up power even after it ruled out any serious effort to bring that about. The result was a series of angry and impassioned statements from   Obama staffers every time there was a mass killing in Syria, statements that rang increasingly hollow as the administration went on. The comments from Obama’s UN ambassador, Samantha Power, sound virtually identical to the ones that Ambassador Haley gave on Wednesday. The Obama team wanted to show that they cared about the slaughter of Syrian civilians on an emotional level, even though they were unwilling to do much about it in concrete policy terms.     Theoretically, this was supposed to maintain the sense that the United States and the international community were committed to opposing human rights violations  —   to stigmatize Assad and his backers in the international realm even if intervention in Syria proper was ruled out. When Trump took office, it seemed like this might change. Trump, given his past statements, clearly did not care about Syria on a humanitarian level. During the campaign, he had talked about partnering with Russia to fight ISIS in the country  —   even though Russian airstrikes had overwhelmingly targeted rebels and Syrian civilians rather than ISIS. So his policy did shift in one clear direction: He made the subtext of Obama’s policy, that Assad would likely stay in power, into text. This wasn’t just Tillerson’s line: Ambassador Haley said, back in March, that “our priority is no longer to sit there and focus on getting Assad out. ” On Tuesday, after the attack, Press Secretary Sean Spicer echoed that: “We would look like, to some degree, rather silly not acknowledging the political realities that exist in Syria. ” This has drawn attacks from some Republicans. Sen. Marco Rubio blamed the chemical attack on Tillerson’s comments.  “It’s concerning that the secretary of state, 72 hours ago or a week ago, last Friday, said that the future’s up to the people in Syria on what happens with Assad. In essence almost nodding to the idea that Assad was gonna get to stay in some capacity,” Rubio said on Wednesday. ”I don’t think it’s a coincidence that a few days later we see this. ” Regardless of whether you think Rubio is right, the clear consequence of this new policy is that they could no longer try to stigmatize Assad in the way the Obama team tried to. Once you give up the game, and admit you don’t really care if Assad stays or goes, it becomes harder to credibly condemn egregious acts like the new chemical weapons strike.     That’s why all of the tough talk we’re seeing from the Trump team is likely more of a smokescreen than anything else. By making vague noises that like they’ll be more aggressive than the last administration, but actually implementing a   policy shift, they’re evading the hard choices that define presidencies, and betraying United States’ nominal role as a defender of human rights. Trump may be right that Assad isn’t going anywhere. But that doesn’t make his response to this chemical attack any less troubling. "
131754,198709,Kentucky’s new Republican governor is entrenching Obamacare while pretending to dismantle it,Vox,Sarah Kliff,2016/1/12,2016.0,1.0,http://www.vox.com/2016/1/12/10754208/kynect-bevin-obamacare," Kentucky’s new Republican governor, Matt Bevin, plans to dismantle his state’s Obamacare marketplace, Kynect. On the surface, this looks like a Tea Party conservative governor taking a stand against the law he campaigned against in 2015.    Except Bevin’s actions don’t really show that at all. The best data we have suggests that the decision of whether to run an Obamacare marketplace isn’t especially consequential. Bevin’s move to kill off the marketplace seems to be a mixture of politics and practicality. It might not make a ton of sense for a state to run a marketplace when the federal government can do so equally well  —   especially when that marketplace is part of a law your party would very much like to repeal. In any case, changes to Kentucky’s Obamacare marketplace are really just a sideshow. The really big decision governors have to make about the law  —   the one that does have consequences  —   is about whether to expand Medicaid. And there, Bevin recently decided in Obamacare’s favor. Kynect doesn’t matter much anymore Kentucky’s state marketplace is called Kynect, and it does seem like a great way to buy health insurance. It was an especially great way to buy health insurance back in 2013, when Healthcare. gov had a disastrous launch. Because Kentucky had built its own marketplace  —   one that actually worked  —   people in the state could actually sign up.    Kentucky got a lot of great press for how well Kynect worked during that first, tumultuous enrollment period, and rightfully so. But now things are different. Healthcare. gov works reliably well  —   and states that use it have done a good job signing people up for health insurance.          All three states have expanded Medicaid, but Kentucky decided to run its own marketplace, while Ohio and West Virginia decided to use Healthcare. gov. Kentucky’s uninsured rate has declined 55. 9 percent. In Ohio it’s dropped 56 percent and in West Virginia 52. 8 percent.    This suggests that the decision whether to run a marketplace does not have that big of an impact on how well Obamacare works at getting people covered. Ohio and West Virginia have done just fine using Healthcare. gov. And Kentucky probably will too. Bevin’s most important Obamacare decision: keeping the Medicaid expansion During his campaign, Bevin promised to kill off the state’s Obamacare Medicaid expansion immediately. ”Absolutely. No question about it. I would reverse that immediately,” Bevin said in February.    But since getting sworn in this past December, his tune has changed  —   a lot. Instead, he quietly announced (right between Christmas and New Year’s) that he would  look at ways to ”transform the way Medicaid is delivered.” Changing delivery of the program is a whole lot different from eliminating it. The decision to expand Medicaid is hugely important. If you look at the states that have had the fastest declines in their uninsured rates  —   the dark purple states in the map above  —   you’ll notice that nearly all of them are participating in the expansion of the public health insurance program. The fact that Bevin backed off Medicaid expansion is hugely important for the     Kentuckians who now use the program. ”It’s pretty clear . .. that it would be damaging to   adults in Kentucky to go from expansion to no expansion,” says Harvard’s Benjamin Sommers, who recently published a study on the effects of Medicaid expansion. ”It would introduce huge affordability issues.” Politically, dismantling Kynect looks like dismantling Obamacare. But the real work of taking down the law would be in dismantling the Medicaid expansion  —   a step Bevin doesn’t seem to want to take.    Bevin will make Obamacare look more like what liberal House Democrats wanted There is something a tad ironic about Bevin, a Tea Party candidate, turning the keys for his exchange over to the Obama administration. He’s giving the federal government more control over how Kentuckians shop for coverage.    Conservative,   governor voluntarily handing over power to the Federal government out of spite https:  . 
  —   Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) January 11, 2016       Liberal Democrats originally envisioned a law where the federal government ran one big, national marketplace. This would give the Obama administration more control over health insurance sales, allowing them to set the rules of the game. States balked. For centuries, they’ve had the authority to manage their own insurance markets. The more centrist Senate bill that ultimately passed turned control of the marketplaces over to the states. Bevin is giving up flexibility in how the state runs the marketplace. Right now, for example, Healthcare. gov lets any insurers who meet a checklist of requirements sell coverage. But Kentucky works differently: It selects a handful of insurers that it thinks will offer the best deal to shoppers. This is meant to stimulate competition, as all the carriers in Kentucky have to try to convince Kynect officials they should get one of the coveted spots. With the transition back to Healthcare. gov, Kentucky won’t be able to do that anymore.    Bevin has said that he’s eliminating Kynect to reduce ”redundancy.” And there is a fair amount of sense to that: If he doesn’t plan to run a more active marketplace  —   the type that   insurers  —   then the Kentucky marketplace would end up looking a lot like the federal one. If that’s the case, it seems completely fair to direct state resources elsewhere. But that decision does come with  . Bevin is losing the flexibility to decide what his marketplace looks like  —   and deciding it is better for the federal government to make those decisions instead. "
131844,198855,Why National Review is attacking Donald Trump,Vox,Jeff Stein,2016/1/22,2016.0,1.0,http://www.vox.com/2016/1/22/10815092/trump-national-review," National Review published more than 20 essays from conservative writers on Friday arguing that the Republican Party should not nominate Donald Trump for president.    The columns all reach the same conclusion, but the reasoning behind them varies considerably from piece to piece. Understanding why the country’s leading conservative thinkers are taking a stand against Trumpism has   consequences  —   not only for this election but also for the   trajectory of conservative thought. We read through the issue, and the accusations against Trump can be more or less boiled down   —   in no particular order  —   to the following five crimes against conservatism.    Case 1: Donald Trump supported liberal policies, Barack Obama, other Democrats In 14 words: Trump is on record as having supported a wide array of policies conservatives detest.    Some of the main issues on which the writers say Trump is not trustworthy: abortion, defense spending, tariffs, and health care. As part of this argument, many of the writers also point to Trump’s donations to Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, and Nancy Pelosi. Who is making this case most strongly: Glenn Beck, L. Brent Bozell III, Erick Erickson, Dana Loesch, and Katie Pavlich.    The most convincing line making this case: ”Conservatives have a serious decision. Do we truly believe in our   principles and insist that politicians have records demonstrating fealty to them? Or are we willing to throw these principles away because an entertainer who has been a liberal Democrat for decades simply says some of the right things?”  —  Katie Pavlich, editor of Townhall Case 2: Trump believes in an authoritarianism fundamentally at odds with conservatism In 29 words: Trump promises to concentrate power further in the hands of the presidency  —   a rejection of many conservatives’ desire to both scale back and decentralize the reach of government. This argument is often tied to the idea that President Obama has overstepped the limits of his authority.    Who is making this case most strongly: David Boaz, Ben Domenech, Steven Hayward, William Kristol, Yuval Levin, David McIntosh, R. R. Reno, and Glenn Beck. The most convincing lines making this case: ”He’s effectively vowing to be an American Mussolini, concentrating power in the Trump White House and governing by fiat.”  —  David Boaz, executive vice president of the Cato Institute ”He presents himself as a Strong Man who promises to knock heads and make things right again. In this, he has a lot more in common with South American populist demagogues than with our tradition of political leaders.”  —  R. R. Reno, editor of First Things Case 3: Trump has engaged in racial demagoguery and xenophobia In 14 words: Several of the conservatives criticized Trump for exploiting the electorate’s fear of minority groups. This is probably the argument liberals would find most persuasive. In some cases, the writers call Trump’s controversial proposals on Mexican and Muslim immigration unrealistic and counterproductive. Who is making this case most strongly: David Boaz, Michael Medved, and Russell Moore.    The most convincing lines making this case: ”Trump’s vitriolic  —   and often racist and sexist  —   language about immigrants, women, the disabled, and others ought to concern anyone who believes that all persons, not just the ‘winners’ of the moment, are created in God’s image.”  —  Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention ”Not since George Wallace has there been a presidential candidate who made racial and religious scapegoating so central to his campaign.”  —  David Boaz, executive vice president of the Cato Institute Case 4: Trump is way too woefully ignorant to be president In 36 words: Trump has demonstrated no mastery or even basic comprehension of the many complex issues facing the American presidency. That level of ignorance alone is a  national security risk that should disqualify him from the Oval Office. Who is making this case most strongly: Andrew McCarthy and Mark Helprin. The most convincing lines making this case: ”Even the casual fan who does not know the players without a scorecard at least knows who the teams are and why they are competing.”  —  Andrew McCarthy, contributing editor of National Review, on Trump’s ignorance on foreign policy ”He doesn’t know the Constitution, history, political philosophy, nuclear strategy, diplomacy, defense, economics beyond real estate, or even, despite his    comportment, how ordinary people live.”  —  Mark Helprin, novelist    Case 5: Trump is just a really bad, evil dude In 19 words: Trump’s temperament  —   rather than his support for any particular policy  —   is what should scare conservatives as much as anything. Who is making this case most strongly: John Podhoretz, Mona Charen, Michael Medved, Thomas Sowell, William Kristol, Cal Thomas, and R. R. Reno. The most convincing lines making this case: ”Worst of all, Trump’s brawling, blustery,   public persona serves to associate conservatives with all the negative stereotypes that liberals have for decades attached to their opponents on the right.”  —  Michael Medved, radio talk show host ”In any integrated personality, the id is supposed to be balanced by an ego and a superego —  by a sense of self that gravitates toward behaving in a mature and responsible way when it comes to serious matters . .. Trump is an unbalanced force. He is the politicized American id.”  —  John Podhoretz, editor of Commentary  ”The man has demonstrated an emotional immaturity bordering on personality disorder, and it ought to disqualify him from being a mayor, to say nothing of a   .”  —  Mona Charen, senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center    "
132518,199770,The best way to pay for an infrastructure surge is to not pay for it at all,Vox,Matthew Yglesias,2016/4/1,2016.0,4.0,http://www.vox.com/2016/4/1/11345396/how-to-pay-for-infrastructure," Hillary Clinton has a plan to boost federal infrastructure spending by $250 billion over five years, paid for by   business tax reform. Bernie Sanders has an even more ambitious plan for a $1 trillion boost over five years, paid for by a bigger hike in corporate taxes. This is typical of how the   Democratic Party works. Policy proposals come with   attached, meaning that candidates need to either trim their aspirations (Clinton) or propose really big tax increases (Sanders). On the Republican side, things look different.    Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are both running on   large tax cuts with only   gestures at how they’d be financed. Their slain establishment foes Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush did the exact same thing. But while these plans are of a scale that makes refusing to address offsets downright dishonest, Democrats are fetishizing accounting returns beyond all reason. Given today’s global and national economic situation, there has rarely been a better time for the government to borrow money. Reasonable critics might worry that $250 billion  —   and even more so $1 trillion  —   in infrastructure money might be wasted on boondoggles and bad projects. But money worth spending on investments in America’s future is money that is worth spending. Stapling the proposal to tax plans that are contentious in their own right is pointless and destructive.    The budget deficit is too low On a daily basis, the Treasury Department does some fancy math based on the current market prices of different kinds of bonds to project a ”real yield curve”  —   the   cost of government borrowing across various time horizons.    As of March 30, the   interest rate on   bonds was a staggeringly low 0. 86 percent, and the   interest rate on   bonds was an even more staggeringly lower negative 0. 26 percent. Global investors, in short, are very eager to buy the federal government’s bonds. So eager that they have pushed the interest the government needs to pay down to freakishly low levels  —   below zero for   securities. It’s a classic case of an imbalance between supply and demand.    The good news is that it’s very easy for the federal government to generate more debt. It just needs Congress to think of something worth doing and then not pay for it. In theory, infrastructure is a very good investment The United States clearly has a lot of infrastructure needs. The toxic water crisis in Flint, Michigan, seems to have been caused in part by a lack of funds for upgrades to the city’s water treatment plant. DC’s Metro system is in a state of crisis due to   upkeep, our electrical grid is desperately outdated, and that’s just a few problems. Historically, major infrastructure projects have had rates of return that far exceed the federal government’s current cost of funds  —   which can be locked in for 30 years at less than 1 percent. Many economists have analyzed the value of infrastructure investment:      Treb Allen and Costas Arkolakis estimate a 9 percent rate of return for the Interstate Highway System. Simon Adler finds that adding highway building in India (where existing infrastructure is notoriously bad) has a rate of return of more than 11 percent.  Dave Donaldson and Richard Hornbeck find an even bigger rate of return for the transcontinental railroad system in the United States.  Even a relatively weak project like the   Appalachian Development Highway System secures an 8 percent rate of return.   Simply put, it turns out that location is very important economically, and initiatives that make it faster to get from point A to point B therefore have a large economic value. America has a lot of bad infrastructure ideas Unfortunately, a number of recent prominent infrastructure projects and proposals tend to fail the basic ”make it faster to get from Point A to Point B” test. Washington, DC’s newly opened streetcar line, for example, moves about as fast as walking and somewhat slower than a bus, while not actually taking riders downtown or offering any useful connections. Unfortunately, these kind of       streetcars are popping up in many American cities due to a mix of poor judgment by the federal Department of Transportation and the fact that real estate developers like the marketing cachet of a streetcar. Similar prioritization of aesthetic over functional considerations is motivating the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey’s effort to replace its existing hideously ugly bus terminal with a much nicer new one that’s a block further west and will make most people’s commutes longer. A remarkably large share of elite discourse around transportation infrastructure, meanwhile, is morbidly fascinated with the way America’s old airports tend to look dingy compared with the much newer ones in China and the United Arab Emirates. This is true, on the whole, but has very little to do with their actual functioning as airports, and making them shinier would have no real transportation benefit. But investments to reduce highway congestion, improve safe travel speeds on rural routes, increase bus speed and frequency, and develop quality rapid transit rail routes can drastically improve the effective size of markets served by American businesses, improving productivity and competition while growing access to jobs and housing.    Trying to ”pay for” good ideas would be counterproductive The debate we ought to be having about federal infrastructure spending right now is whether we have a way to channel money into useful projects  —   not how to ”pay for” the spending. America is not currently experiencing a shortfall of financing options. On the contrary, global financial markets are practically begging us to go borrow some more money. The interest rates available are so outlandishly low that virtually anything that was useful at all (i. e. not a   streetcar or a relocation of a bus terminal to a less convenient location) would have a rate of return higher than the cost of funds. Under the circumstances, there’s no good reason to try to finance projects with taxes rather than debt. Doing so is only going to increase political opposition to your plan  —   no tax reform, no matter how cleverly designed, can fail to offend a powerful interest group or two  —   and make it less likely that the project will get done. And global markets, again, are telling us not that America’s taxes are too low but that we’re not borrowing enough money. There’s a global shortage of American debt. Indeed, a 2014 International Monetary Fund analysis concluded that in rich countries like the US, ”public investment that is financed by issuing debt has larger output effects than when it is financed by raising taxes or cutting other spending.” It’s better, in other words, to just build the projects than to fuss about paying for them. We need a good dose of irresponsibility. "
133094,200671,Game of Thrones’ Dany/Dothraki storyline doesn’t make any sense,Vox,Matthew Yglesias,2016/6/3,2016.0,6.0,http://www.vox.com/2016/6/3/11834606/game-of-thrones-dany-dothraki-no-sense," Every week throughout season six, a handful of Vox’s writers will discuss the latest episode of Game of Thrones. Before you dig in, check out our recap of Sunday’s episode, as well the archive of our entire discussion to date. Next up this week is executive editor Matt Yglesias. Matt Yglesias: I have a different complaint about Dany’s rousing speech to the Dothraki than what Todd and Andrew have raised: Why are the Dothraki cheering?    What are they being promised that sounds so appealing? If you were a nomadic horseman living on the steppes of Essos enjoying a lifestyle of raiding, raping, and plundering, why on earth would you want to follow a foreign,   queen onto a bunch of boats to travel to a distant, poorer continent and start raiding there? She wants to do it to vindicate some lost family grudge. But what do the Dothraki care about the Targaryen family’s animosity toward House Lannister? What about Dany’s speech is supposed to be so convincing?    Game of Thrones’ version of the Meereen plot certainly had its share of flaws, but it did convey the basic message that politics is a lot harder than setting your enemies on fire. Even if we’re supposed to believe that Dany has had a change of heart since the failure of her social reform program in Slaver’s Bay, that same lesson still ought to apply in the heart of Vaes Dothrak.    Trapping the collected khals together in one building and then burning them to death was a clever trick. And it’s easy enough to believe, given when we’ve seen of Dothraki culture, that this display of cunning and ruthlessness combined with the timely arrival of Drogon could awe the Dothraki into bowing down to Dany. But she’s effectively asking the Dothraki to abandon their entire way of life.    Their language doesn’t even have words for ”boat” or ”armor” or ”castle,” so she has to talk about ”wooden horses” and ”iron suits” and ”stone houses.” What about her speech is supposed to be so convincing? Going all the way back to season one, people have been raising concerns about the racist depiction of the Dothraki on the show. As a purely semantic manner, I’m not sure that’s right. The Dothraki seem far enough away from any ”real world” analog that it’s not quite clear which actual human ethnic group is being maligned here. But they are flattened out and denied any real individuality or agency. When Dany emerges from the flames, they all bow down. When she says they should completely abandon what they’ve been doing for generations and embark on a harebrained scheme to conquer Westeros, they all cheer.    Maybe  —   hopefully!  —   this storyline will become more complicated in future episodes and we’ll see something of the dialogue and debate within the Dothraki community over what exactly they’re doing. But for now it strikes me as awfully crude. Nor is it clear, incidentally, why Dany thinks importing a gigantic army of Dothraki to another continent is a good idea. Recruiting horselords to conquer Westeros was her brother Viserys’s idea, but Dany has dragons and the Unsullied at her side. Aegon the Conqueror took Westeros with three dragons and a relatively small number of troops by offering the great lords of the realm a simple deal: Either bend the knee (as the scions of Houses Stark, Tully, and Lannister did) and keep your lands and titles or else be burned to death. This seems like a good model to emulate, and one for which an elite strike force of disciplined Unsullied would be very useful. But the Dothraki are, presumably, not interested in accepting a bunch of peaceful surrenders. And if they run around sacking and pillaging, the local lords are going to have no choice but to fight back, no matter how scared they are of Dany’s dragons. Long story short, I don’t think this storyline makes sense from either side. Having escaped from the khals, Dany and the Dothraki ought to simply go their separate ways.

133920,202228,"The ""road of death"" at the center of the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo",Vox,Yochi Dreazen,2016/9/17,2016.0,9.0,http://www.vox.com/2016/9/17/12934516/syria-maps," It’s nicknamed the ”road of death”: a dusty   highway lined with the wreckage of   cars and the shells of blackened, deserted buildings. It’s also the only way into the besieged Syrian city of Aleppo, and the latest desperate attempt at a ceasefire collapsed in part because of a fierce fight over its future.    The highway is called Castello Road, named after a restaurant and resort complex that was shuttered earlier in the    Syrian civil war. It stretches from Turkey to   eastern Aleppo, where 250, 000 civilians are facing shortages of food, water, and medicine. The UN’s top aid official, Stephen O’Brien, recently said the grim situation there amounted to a ”humanitarian catastrophe unparalleled in the over five years of bloodshed and carnage in the Syrian conflict.”           Under the terms of the ceasefire pact, the Syrian troops who have held the road since July and the rebels who’ve been fighting to take it back ever since were supposed to pull back from the highway, allowing aid convoys to make their way to Aleppo. Trucks holding enough supplies to feed 40, 000 people for a month have been stuck in the Turkish city of Cilvegozu, unable to reach Aleppo’s starving residents. That didn’t happen. Instead, the deal collapsed in acrimony after a dramatic few days that began with a botched US airstrike that killed 62 Syrian troops and ended with Damascus announcing that the ceasefire was over. For Washington and its allies, meanwhile, the continued closure of Castello Road meant the deal had failed even before its formal collapse because the pact hadn’t prevented Aleppo from continuing to starve while aid convoys languished just over the border in Turkey.    The culprit? The continued sparring over Castello Road. Under the terms of the pact, Syrian forces and rebel troops were both supposed to pull back from the highway so the aid trucks could start to roll in. Neither side fully kept up its end of the bargain, leaving the road too dangerous for the trucks to navigate. In the end, none of the aid convoys were able to make it down the highway and into the   areas of Aleppo.    In a statement, O’Brien, the UN human rights chief, said he was ”pained and disappointed” the aid convoys weren’t able to reach the city. Neither he nor senior American diplomats offered any guesses about when that could change.           Before the collapse of the pact, Russian troops  —   who have been in Syria fighting on behalf of the Assad government  —   had began deploying into Syrian military positions along the highway. Those can be dangerous places to be: In a widely shared video, a Russian officer standing on Castello Road began praising the ceasefire, only to have to run for cover when gunfire suddenly rang out.     During Live Russian MoD Briefing from #Aleppo Russian&Syrian soldiers on #Castello road came under fire pic. twitter.   —   Military Advisor (@miladvisor) September 13, 2016  Almost immediately after the ceasefire broke down, the Syrian and Russian militaries began an   bombardment of   areas of Aleppo that has dramatically worsened the humanitarian crisis. The US has threatened to completely walk away from talks with Russia aimed at reinstating the ceasefire if Russia does not stop its bombardment and allow in humanitarian aid. ”We’re on the verge of suspending the discussion because it’s irrational in the context of the kind of bombing taking place,” US Secretary of State John Kerry said at an event organized by The Atlantic magazine.    Russia, however, does not seem to be moved by the threat and has vowed to continue bombing, accusing the US of trying to use a proposed ceasefire to allow the ”terrorists” (what Russia and the Assad regime call the rebels) to regroup. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov declared that Castello Road could not be used for humanitarian aid delivery to Aleppo because of the ”terrorist threat.” And so the bombardment and siege of Aleppo continues, with no hope in sight for the tens of thousands of Syrians trapped inside.

133959,202278,The 7 best new TV comedies of the fall,Vox,Caroline Framke,2016/9/23,2016.0,9.0,http://www.vox.com/2016/9/23/13008264/best-tv-comedies-fall-2016," The 2016 fall TV season kicks off with a particularly rich batch of comedies, from network family sitcoms to existential crises punctuated by jokes to shows that wear their weird hearts on their sleeves.     But since watching all of them would mean a guaranteed cratering of your social life, here are our top seven comedy recommendations counted down to our very favorites  —   decided after watching every advance copy we could get  —   to help you figure out what you might like to give a shot. (You can check out our full rankings of 43 new fall TV shows here.) 7) Fleabag (Amazon)  Debuted: Friday, September 16, on Amazon Phoebe  ’s   series has already aired in the UK, but Amazon’s decision to bring the bracing comedy stateside is cause for celebration.     The show is adapted from her stage play of the same name, and   stars as the title character  —   a witty, angry, and often miserable woman who’s trying to keep herself together after a pair of recent deaths in her life, while those around her try to brush them off and move on.     Fleabag speaks directly to the audience between scenes, twisting a traditional voiceover to make it more intimate, more conspiratorial. And   is so much fun to watch that you might not realize until the end of each episode that her story is downright devastating. 6) One Mississippi (Amazon)  Debuted: Friday, September 9, on Amazon Comedian Tig Notaro, more or less playing herself, returns home to Mississippi in the wake of her mother’s death, where she’s forced to reconnect with a stepfather and brother she probably doesn’t know as well as she should.     Moving and affecting, the series has a dreamy tone that evokes grief and longing without pushing too hard, and even if Notaro isn’t the world’s greatest actress, she’s taken a lesson from many, many other   shows and surrounded herself with a cast that balances out her weaknesses. 5) The Good Place (NBC)  Debuted: Monday, September 19, at 10 pm on NBC; moved to Thursdays at 8:30 pm on September 22 One of the fall’s most promising new comedies is also one of its strangest. Kristen Bell plays a woman who mistakenly ends up in ”the Good Place,” a. k. a. heaven, after she dies and must hide the reality of her selfish life on Earth to keep herself out of ”the bad place.”     This    concept likely would’ve proved too much for a shakier creative team to handle, but Bell and her   Ted Danson  —   who essentially plays the Good Place’s concierge  —   have plenty of sharp and wonderfully irreverent material to work with thanks to creator Mike Schur (Parks and Recreation, The Office). Keep a close eye on the set’s background; there are jokes and sight gags everywhere. 4) Better Things (FX)  Debuted: Thursday, September 8, on FX From the mind of Pamela Adlon (Louie) comes Better Things, a wry and deeply felt series about a single mother named Sam (Adlon) who’s raising three daughters  —   ranging in age from 4 to 16 years old  —   while pursuing an acting career.  But that premise makes the show sound a whole lot more basic than it is, thanks to Adlon’s particularly spiky humor and mature performances from her TV offspring (Mikey Madison, Hannah Alligood, and Olivia Edward) who all remind you in their own ways that kids can be hilarious, mean, selfish, and loving, all at once. 3) Speechless (ABC)  Debuted: Wednesday, September 21, at 8:30 pm on ABC Speechless is the best new network comedy of the fall because it manages to make a family sitcom feel like a brand new concept. The show kicks off as the DiMeo clan makes its umpteenth move to a fancier school district, the better to accommodate their teenage son J. J. (Micah Fowler) who has cerebral palsy and communicates by typing words into a touchscreen computer.  The cast is fantastic, with strong anchors in Fowler and Minnie Driver as the mom who makes sure J. J. is taken care of, no matter how aggressive she needs to get. And with a   script from former Friends producer Scott Silveri  —   whose brother has cerebral palsy  —   it’s immediately   and full of heart.    2) Atlanta (FX)  Debuted: Tuesday, September 6, at 10 pm on FX There’s nothing on television quite like Atlanta, which is not something we say lightly, given how many TV shows exist in this era of Peak TV. Former Community star Donald Glover  —   who left the show in its fifth season to work on his own projects  —   returns to his hometown of Atlanta to give viewers a glimpse of what life is actually like for a specific swath of the city’s residents, many of whom are poor and black and rarely seen on television. Per Glover, Atlanta doesn’t have a traditional writers’ room; the members of his   writing team swap stories and then write based on their conversations, and director Hiro Murai didn’t have much TV experience when he signed on. As a result, Atlanta is unique and incredibly intimate. With Glover’s   Earnest ”Earn” Marks anchoring the show, Atlanta is funny, surreal, and entirely its own. 1) Insecure (HBO)  Debuts: Sunday, October 9, at 10:30 pm on HBO Issa Rae was a highly   talent after the success of her 2011 web series The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl, and her   new HBO series Insecure proves why.    with Larry Wilmore, Insecure is a sharp comedy about a fictionalized version of Rae who’s grappling with a static relationship and the realities of often being the only black woman in the room  —   especially at her job doing   youth outreach, where she’s surrounded by white people who insist they’re enlightened even as they treat her with kid gloves.  Alongside her best friend Molly (Yvonne Orji) Issa learns how to be the most confident version of herself, whether by rapping at her own reflection in the mirror to hype herself up before going out or by opening up to her kind (if aimless) boyfriend. Every episode of Insecure is better than the one before, and director Melina Matsoukas makes every frame of its South Los Angeles setting shine. (And hey: the first episode is currently available on HBO and streaming on HBO Go early, so get to it!)       "
134054,202465,"Bill Clinton’s anti-Obamacare remarks, explained",Vox,Sarah Kliff,2016/10/4,2016.0,10.0,http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/4/13162654/bill-clinton-obamacare," Former President Bill Clinton’s unexpected remarks about Obamacare  —   delivered Tuesday at a Hillary Clinton rally in Michigan  —   were so negative, they might have felt more at home in a Republican stump speech.    “You’ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care, and then the people that are out there busting it  —   sometimes 60 hours a week  —   wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half,” Clinton said at a rally Tuesday morning in Flint, Michigan. “It’s the craziest thing in the world. ” Clinton’s remarks were, in some places, an exceptionally honest assessment of some of the health law’s struggles and weak spots, like how coverage has become unaffordable for some   Americans. But in other places, Clinton seemed to create new   talking points. He accuses health insurers of “overcharging” customers so they can make “whopping profits” in the individual market  —   absent any evidence of this happening, and regardless of Obamacare regulations that prohibit this type of behavior.     Clinton is right  —   American health care really is a crazy system! First things first: Clinton did remark that the “current system” we have for health care is ”the craziest thing in the world. ”     Watching the remarks, it seems pretty clear to me that Clinton is talking more broadly about the American health care system, and the patchwork of insurance programs that cover most citizens. Here’s the full quote from the transcript.   The current system works fine if you’re eligible for Medicaid, if you’re a lower income working person, if you’re already on Medicare, or if you get enough subsidies on a modest income that you can afford your health care.  But the people that are getting killed in this deal are   people and individuals who make just a little too much to get any of these subsidies. Why? Because they’re not organized, they don’t have any bargaining power with insurance companies, and they’re getting whacked. So you’ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden, 25 million more people have health care, and then the people that are out there busting it  —   sometimes 60 hours a week  —   wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It’s the craziest thing in the world.     At least to me, it seems that Clinton is describing Obamacare as one chunk of a nonsensical “current system. ” And I think most Democrats  —   most Americans, really  —   would agree with this assessment of how health insurance works in the United States. Obama, after all, wasn’t starting from scratch when he began pursuing health reform. There wasn’t a politically viable path to ending   insurance and moving to a simpler system. So Obama ended up pushing a patch that would make a Byzantine system work better  —   but certainly didn’t make a crazy system sane.  We have a health care system where access to coverage depends on where you live, where you work, how old you are, and how much you earn. When any of those variables change  —   you get older, move states, switch jobs  —   you switch to a new type of coverage with its own   doctor networks, and paperwork. You can’t really compare any of the different programs because they’re all structured so differently. And most of them offer very little transparency about how much health care will actually cost you after you sign up.    So, in a nutshell, yes! Our current system is confusing and complex  —   it was before Obamacare passed, and it still is afterward. Clinton offered an important critique about Obamacare that most Democrats won’t Much of Clinton’s remarks centered on a very specific group of Americans: Those who are uninsured and earn too much money to qualify for subsidized coverage  —   and who are exposed to   premium increases.  “The people that are getting killed in this deal are   people and individuals who make just a little too much to get any of these subsidies,” Clinton remarked in Flint.  A bit of background is helpful here. The Affordable Care Act provides subsidies to purchase health insurance to people who earn less than 400 percent of the poverty line  —   $47, 520 for an individual or $97, 200 for a family of four. These subsidies limit how much an individual has to pay for coverage. For example, someone earning $47, 000 won’t have to spend more than 9. 6 percent of her income on premiums regardless of the actual price. The government will kick in subsidies to cover the rest. But there are many people who earn more than 400 percent of the poverty line, and they don’t have any sort of protection against high premiums. If an insurance plan jacks up rates by 20 or 30 percent  —   as many are this year, after losing money on the marketplaces  —   then a person above 400 percent of the poverty line has to pay the new price or go uninsured.    This   population doesn’t get a huge amount of policy attention. We actually don’t know how many people are in this situation. The government hasn’t collected data on this issue, but some estimate it could be as many as 10 million people.  And Clinton is right: These people aren’t especially   by the health care law. They’re stuck deciding between whether to pay more and more for premiums or go without coverage. Clinton’s new bizarre attack on Obamacare: insurers can make “whooping profits” When Clinton criticized Obamacare for the people it left behind, I understood it. It didn’t make total sense politically, but from a policy standpoint he was pointing out an important weakness in a law the president has already said needs improvement. But there was another part of Clinton’s remarks  —   where he raises the idea that insurers might jack up rates to increase their profits  —   that didn’t square with anything I know about Obamacare and its implementation. Here’s that part where Clinton is talking about the individual market. If you were an insurer, you’d say, ”Gosh, I only got 2, 000 people in this little pool. Eighty percent of insurance costs every year come from 20 percent of the people. If I get unlucky in the pool, I’ll lose money.” So they overcharge you just to make sure, and on good years, they just make a whopping profit from the people who are least able to pay it. This critique is weird to me on two levels. First, the health care law includes a provision specifically meant to prevent this type of behavior. The health care law’s   rule requires insurance plans to put at least 80 percent of premiums toward actual medical care, leaving aside a maximum of 20 percent of the premium for administrative costs and profit. The Obamacare rules make it much, much harder for insurers to gain “whooping profits. ”    It’s true that insurance plans are significantly increasing Obamacare premiums in 2017. Most insurers have so far lost money in the marketplaces, and are trying to price more accurately for coming years. The idea that they’re making whooping profits is quite at odds with what we know about how the marketplaces have fared so far  —   and the actual text of Obamacare itself.  I asked a spokesperson for Bill Clinton to clarify what Clinton meant when he referred to whopping profits. I have not heard back yet, but did receive a statement earlier in the day about the overall remarks.  “President Clinton spoke about the importance of the Affordable Care Act and the good it has done to expand coverage for millions of Americans” spokeswoman Angel Urena wrote. “And while he was slightly   it’s clear to everyone, including President Obama, that improvements are needed. ” "
134179,202677,Why Google is giving up on its dream to bring super-fast broadband to everyone,Vox,Ariel Stulberg,2016/10/17,2016.0,10.0,http://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/10/17/13230500/gigabit-networks-chattanooga-google," Alphabet, the parent company of Google, announced on Tuesday that it was curbing its expansion of Google Fiber, an ambitious effort to bring   internet access to a number of metropolitan areas. It’s the latest setback for those who hope to bring speeds of 1 gigabit per second  —   about 50 times faster than a typical connection  —   to every American.    A few dozen cities in America have   broadband networks that offer gigabit speeds. These   connections were supposed to revolutionize Americans’ experience of the internet and rev up the country’s noncompetitive broadband market.  When these networks were being built, advocates pointed to a number of potential applications. Gigabit networks, they promised, would enable users to interact in complex virtual reality environments. They’d make possible    teleconferencing that could allow seniors to visit doctors from home. But six years after the first   connections went live, even proponents concede no “killer” gigabit application has emerged. Most of their potential, critics say, is simply ignored by users. And building gigabit networks nationwide would be a colossally expensive undertaking.    That has caused even some former enthusiasts of these networks to wonder whether the early hype around gigabit networks was misplaced. Perhaps it makes sense to settle for more incremental  —   and much less expensive  —   upgrades to the networks we already have.    Fiber optic networks were supposed to be the internet’s future            Most Americans get their internet via telephone and cable television wires that have been in the ground for decades. These lines weren’t designed to carry digital data, and as a result internet service over them tends to be slow. New fiber optics networks, which send data as pulses of light along strands of glass, really are better. The first Google Fiber network went live in Kansas City in 2013.     Along with making money, the company bosses said they hoped to strengthen the internet’s technological foundations. “We don’t want incremental change,” Google Fiber’s Kevin Lo said in a 2012 interview. “Offering you a 10 Mbps service and edging it to 50 Mbps and then 100 Mbps, that’s not what drives real innovation. ” Google set an initial goal of signing up 5 million subscribers in its first five years. More than 1, 100 municipalities applied to be part of the program. The company has expanded the service to seven cities so far, but it now looks like the expansion phase is winding down.    Google was a pioneer, but it wasn’t the first to reach gigabit speeds. That honor falls to Chattanooga, Tennessee  —   population 173, 000  —   which built a publicly owned fiber optic network in 2010, making it the first American city to offer gigabit speeds citywide. The network cost $330 million to install and initially offered gigabit speeds for $350 a month  —   a price that has since fallen to $70. Last year, Chattanooga demonstrated just how fast fiber optic networks can be when it boosted its top speed to 10 gigabits per second.  To put that in context, that’s more than 500 times faster than the average speed of a US internet connection of 15. 3 megabits per second. Chattanooga became the first city in America to deploy     internet service in 2010 When it began, Chattanooga officials spoke of the project as part a   revitalization of the city’s deindustrialized economy. They believed that having one of the nation’s fastest broadband networks would give the city a decisive economic advantage  —   allowing the city’s residents to use, or maybe even develop, the next generation of internet applications. And Chattanooga wasn’t alone; there were dozens of   efforts to install fiber in small cities nationwide. The nation’s largest internet providers  —   Comcast, Verizon, AT&T  —   have rolled out some fiber offerings as well. Advocates want the feds to push a nationwide fiber network As a result, about 14 percent of Americans have access to gigabit speeds today. That’s not nearly enough for Susan Crawford, a professor at Harvard Law School. In her book Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age, Crawford called for a massive national fiber project comparable to Dwight Eisenhower’s creation of the National Highway System.    The gigabit applications we’ve seen so far, she told me, are only the vaguest hints of what’s to come.  “It’s a phase change, like ice turning into water” “One helpful analogy is to the history of electrification,” she said. “We thought when electricity first came on the scene it would just be a few street lights, maybe one light at home. ” Crawford dismissed talk of building gradually on current speeds. In her view, gigabit networks represent a revolution over current broadband, not simply a marginal improvement.   “It’s a phase change,” she said, “like ice turning into water. ”  A few countries, notably South Korea, have invested more in   networks than America has. But there isn’t yet much sign that the faster networks have given these countries a big technological edge. Crawford argues that’s because countries like South Korea lack the United States’ entrepreneurial dynamism.     “If you come up with something there, you just get bought by Samsung,” she said.  Skeptics say a gigabit fiber network isn’t worth the cost Of course, there’s another possibility: Maybe people just don’t have any use for so much bandwidth. That’s the view of Doug Brake, of Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a think tank funded by foundation and government grants as well as donations from firms such as Google and IBM.   “There are no apps today and no apps on the horizon,” he said, though he acknowledged that development of new applications would probably proceed more quickly with far broader gigabit coverage. The basic issue is that even the most   of today’s applications use far, far less than a gigabit  —   1, 000 megabits per second  —   of bandwidth. Right now, one of the most   applications out there is Netflix. Netflix recommends users have at least 3 Mbps of bandwidth for   video  —   meaning that you could stream about 300 Netflix videos simultaneously on a 1 gigabit connection. If you want Netflix’s   streaming, called Ultra HD, that requires 25 Mbps. So a gigabit connection would allow you to stream 40 Ultra HD videos at a time. “There are no apps today and no apps on the horizon” “People throughout history have been proven wrong, so I’m open to that,” Brake said, “but nothing before our eyes justifies spending hundreds of billions of dollars on this stuff. ”  He rejected Crawford’s federal approach as “an absurd waste of government resources. ”     To the extent that there’s any problem with US internet service, he said, it’s with connectivity in remote, rural areas.  The focus of policy should be on “making sure our nation’s poor have access to the internet at acceptable speeds,” he said. For the most part, that means incentivizing the major broadband providers to expand and upgrade their existing networks, which are often much slower than 1 gigabit. Brake points to Vector DSL and DOCSIS 3. 1, new standards that allow telephone and cable networks, respectively, to carry more data than before. He also highlighted the forthcoming fifth generation of mobile broadband (5G) which will have speeds about 10 times those of 4G devices. With that kind of steady progress, he argues, it would be foolish to spend billions of dollars on a fiber networks that would deliver far more bandwidth than most households know what to do with. New networks have benefits beyond gigabit speeds Blair Levin has a long record as a cheerleader for faster broadband networks. He oversaw the creation of the Federal Communications Commission’s National Broadband Plan in 2009 and 2010. Then he led Gig. U, a private group promoting gigabit networks on college campuses.  But his enthusiasm for gigabit networks has cooled a bit in recent years  —   a situation he calls “highly ironic” given his earlier views.    “There’s nothing magical about a gig,” he said. “The gig has become the marketing nomenclature. ” It’s not the speed of the networks he cares about, but their impact on the broader broadband marketplace. When he and his colleagues set out to write the National Broadband Plan in 2009, Levin said, most US households had no more than two options for broadband service  —   usually a cable company and a local telephone company. The weak competitive pressure inherent in that structure reduces firms’ incentive to invest in better technology, especially because building a new network can cannibalize usage of existing networks. “There’s nothing magical about a gig. The gig has become the marketing nomenclature. ” ”I don’t begrudge anyone their return on investment,” Levin said. However, he noted, the major providers’ incentive “is not to provide ‘better, faster, cheaper,’ but to maximize return on investment.” So without pressure from outside, incumbent broadband providers have a tendency to rest on their laurels. In contrast, when a third party announces plans to build a new network in a particular city, the local cable and DSL providers often responded by offering faster, cheaper service of their own. Comcast, for example, recently announced a new 2 gigabit cable service that will be available in both Chattanooga and Atlanta, Georgia  —   a Google Fiber city.    Fiber upgrades are losing momentum  —   and that might be okay Google Fiber’s rollout was painstaking and slow, and the project failed to meet its growth goals.  From 2014 onward, the company required wannabe “Fiber cities” to promise they’ll expedite Fiber’s installation in various ways. These included providing detailed information on and access to existing infrastructure, streamlined construction permitting, and other concessions. Getting cities to buy into the whole program has proved difficult. AT&T is continuing to expand its fiber optic network, called Giga Power. Verizon invested heavily in its own fiber optic service, called FiOS, over the past decade. But in recent years, new FiOS investments have practically ground to a halt. All three firms have recently signaled plans to shift away from laying fiber lines directly into subscribers’ homes. The new initiatives revolved around covering the   “last mile” using 5G wireless, which is easier to install but runs at slower speeds. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has proposed an additional $275 billion in spending on America’s infrastructure over the next five years. Some of that money would flow to boosting internet access to underserved areas. Another tranche would go to grants for towns looking to create “modern digital communities,” part of which would likely to go fiber buildout.  Levin and Crawford praised the proposal as a step in the right direction. Brake praised it too, citing its focus on broadband availability (rather than speed) and its neutrality as to which technology to employ.      But more ambitious proposals, like Crawford’s dream of a national, federally subsidized fiber network, don’t seem likely to materialize. “Let’s get real,” several experts told me. Maybe that’s not such a bad thing. Right now, incremental improvements to existing broadband networks seem to be providing most Americans with plenty of bandwidth for today’s applications. On the other hand, maybe some scrappy tech entrepreneurs in South Korea will shock everyone into rethinking the question. "
134405,203056,"For some world leaders, Trump’s victory is a nightmare. For others, it’s validation.",Vox,Jennifer Williams,2016/11/9,2016.0,11.0,http://www.vox.com/presidential-election/2016/11/9/13573896/world-leaders-react-donald-trump-election-victory-win," Mainstream political leaders of some of America’s closest Western allies gasped as the news broke that Donald Trump had been elected as the new leader of the free world.     The French ambassador to the United States tweeted, “A world is crumbling before our eyes. Vertigo. ” Germany’s foreign minister lamented that “US foreign policy will be less predictable for us,” and warned, “Nothing will be easier. Much will be harder. ” Former Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt called it a “year of double disaster of the West,” referring to the equally stunning Brexit vote.  But where some leaders saw disaster, others saw a milestone to celebrate  —   and the most potent validation yet of their own beliefs.   Russian President Vladimir Putin  —   no doubt ecstatic that the candidate with a decidedly   outlook had beaten the woman he once said “has no soul”  —   sent Trump a congratulatory telegram expressing confidence that Trump’s win would lead to ”a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington on the principles of equality, mutual respect and real consideration for each other’s position.”     Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s   and   Front National party, triumphantly proclaimed that Trump’s victory was “not the end of the world,” as many other European leaders clearly saw it, but rather “the end of a world. ” The Dutch   populist politician Geert Wilders also expressed his elation on Twitter, calling Trump’s victory “historic” and a “revolution,” and promising, “We too will give our country back to the Dutch!”    Cambodia’s authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has maintained his firm grip on power in the country for more than three decades by brutally cracking down on political dissent, wrote a message on his official Facebook page congratulating Trump and reiterating his support for the  . “American voters have shown their choice to elect your excellency. . .. My support for your candidacy is not wrong either,” he wrote.   President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who over the past decade has systematically transformed Turkish democracy into his own personal autocratic fiefdom, said in a speech in Istanbul that he hoped “that this choice of the American people will lead to beneficial steps being taken for the world concerning basic rights and freedoms, democracy and developments in our region. ”     Erdogan and Trump already have one important belief in common: Each has spoken warmly of Putin and signaled that they would prefer Syrian President Bashar   retain power despite killing hundreds of thousands of his own citizens during the country’s brutal civil war. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   who stole power from Egypt’s democratically elected government in a military coup in June 2014 and since then has violently cracked down on dissent and free speech in the country, said he “looks forward to the presidency of President Donald Trump to inject a new spirit into the trajectory of   relations. ” In a later statement, Sisi’s office bragged that the Egyptian president had been the first world leader to reach Trump by phone and personally congratulate him.    Nigel Farage, the acting leader of the UK Independence Party whose   and   rhetoric was hugely influential in the pushing the British vote to leave the European Union, tweeted: “I hand over the mantle to @RealDonaldTrump! Many congratulations. You have fought a brave campaign. ” He also tweeted, “What we are witnessing is the end of a period of big business and big politics controlling our lives. ” This stark disparity between these two responses is no accident. It reflects the deep global divide between two fundamentally different, and competing, visions of the world: a vision of a more open, tolerant, and interconnected world where borders and identities are fluid and cultural diversity is embraced; and a vision of a world defined by walls and borders erected to separate groups along strict lines of national, ethnic, religious, and cultural identity in which outsiders and diverse views are often met with fear and suspicion. Donald Trump’s victory, as Le Pen proudly noted, represents the latest  —   albeit one of the most dramatic and potentially consequential  —   blow to the progressive, liberal vision of the world that has defined US and European policy for nearly a generation. Trump’s constant drumbeat of populist,   rhetoric and his narrow   approach to foreign policy closely align with the policy views of his populist fellow travelers in Europe like Le Pen and Farage. But even more profoundly, his fundamental lack of respect for basic liberal democratic principles like rule of law and freedom of the press put him squarely in the camp of authoritarian leaders like Russia’s Putin and Turkey’s Erdogan.  That a man whose politics most closely align with such characters has now been elected to lead the United States of America may not, as Le Pen proclaimed, truly mark the end of the liberal vision of the world, but it certainly represents a severe blow to it.

136395,205863,Sessions doesn’t want to investigate police. Here’s why we need to.,Washington Post,Jonathan Smith,2017-03-10,2017.0,3.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170312010419/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/03/10/sessions-doesnt-want-to-investigate-police-heres-why-we-need-to/
","     Michael Brown’s death on the streets of Ferguson, Mo. on Aug. 9, 2014, changed the national conversation about policing and race. Police abuse became daily   news; the Black Lives Matter movement was born; race and inequality turned into mainstream political issues. Underlining much of the discussion after Brown’s shooting was a March 2015 report by the Justice Department’s civil rights division that detailed how the Ferguson police department and municipal court had destroyed the lives of thousands of African American residents. Statistics, data analysis and scores of startling stories filled the report. One was tased after he verbally protested his pedestrian stop; a woman went to jail because she was unable to pay a parking fine. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, though, has announced that he intends to “pull back ” from investigating civil rights violations by police. Instead, his Justice Department will focus on improving police morale and on federalizing more prosecutions to ensure that people convicted of crimes serve longer sentences. Sessions asserts that these steps are necessary to address what he says is a crisis in violent crime. The investigations of Ferguson and, later, of Chicago? Without having read them  Sessions dismissed the reports as “pretty anecdotal. ” The attorney general is wrong on the facts: Crime is at historic lows, major cities are safer than they’ve been in decades, and violent crime rates are half of what they were in the early 1990s. And he is wrong on the policy, as well. Tolerating widespread civil rights violations by police and giving up the Justice Department’s power to investigate misconduct will simply make matters worse and won’t help address the serious public safety issues that some communities really are suffering through. I know because I helped write the reports, and I have seen the effect they have on communities. I was a member of the team that investigated the Ferguson Police Department and more than 20 others. Since I left the Justice Department in 2015, the division has completed additional investigations of Chicago and Baltimore. In each investigation, we reviewed hundreds of thousands of pages of documents; interviewed police and government officials at all levels; met with hundreds of residents; and relied on the expertise of police executives, who served as consultants. We took great pains to talk to those who felt that their rights had been violated, as well as people who believed that police practices were appropriate. We worked hard to make the reports readable and to speak to the entire community. The findings were designed to create a common set of facts that would serve as a basis for an effective remedy and facilitate reconciliation. The point was not to embarrass individual officers but to build trust and confidence between police and their communities. Often, the results of these investigations were the first step in healing the breach between police and the communities of color they serve. Many investigations result in a court order called a consent decree, which requires a city to correct police behavior by ensuring that proper policies, training, supervision and accountability measures are in place so that violations are not repeated. Such decrees are subject to lengthy negotiations and review by a federal judge to determine if they are “fair, reasonable and adequate. ” These reports and the resulting agreements for reform have made a dramatic difference. In New Orleans, consent decree reforms implemented in 2013 led to a 28 percent drop in Taser use from 2014 to 2015; bites from police dogs declined by 10 percent in the same period. The police department has made a “remarkable turnaround,” according to the court monitor, in its handling of sexual assault and domestic violence cases, including new policies that DOJ lawyers described as a model for the nation. The monitor also saw significant improvement in the civilian complaint process, leading to increased use by residents. In East Haven, Conn. several officers from a police department rife with racial bias were convicted of federal civil rights violations. Following a civil rights investigation, the court ordered a consent decree mandating reform of policies, training, supervision, hiring practices and officer discipline. Afterward, the court monitor noted that biased policing had fallen dramatically, and relations between police and the Latino community had improved. One Latino community member described the change: “It’s a different world now. ” In Seattle, community trust of the police has increased since implementation of a 2012 consent decree regarding the use of force. As part of the decree, the monitor conducted annual community perception surveys. In 2013, 9 percent of African Americans and Latinos reported being victims of excessive force, and 47 percent of residents approved of the handling of traffic stops. By 2016, those numbers were 1 percent and 65 percent, respectively. Following a 2003 consent decree to address   practices in Detroit, fatal   shootings dropped dramatically . In the five years before the Justice Department’s investigation, 47 people died in police shootings. Between 2009 and 2014, that number fell to 17. Use of chemical spray went from 460 incidents in 2000 to about 50 per year by 2014. And use of force decreased from 873 incidents in 2010 to 473 in 2013, just before the decree ended. Federal investigations don’t lead only to concrete reforms. Just as important, they provide an official acknowledgment of how communities of color experience police mistreatment, which is essential for reconciliation. The report on Chicago this year revealed that the coverup of Laquan McDonald’s shooting was not an aberration but part of a deeply ingrained culture. In Baltimore, tens of thousands of black residents were stopped  —   sometimes as frequently as 30 times over a   period  —   without probable cause, and only 3. 7 percent of pedestrian stops resulted in an arrest or a citation. Police officers in Baltimore were told to “lock up all the black hoodies,” a massive interference with individual liberty that did nothing to solve crime and created resentment and mistrust between the police and communities. In Ferguson, our report detailed what happens when a police department and court place revenue above public safety and target the African American community for excessive enforcement, for the sole purpose of draining their wallets. As we showed in our reports on Newark, Cleveland, Albuquerque, Seattle, Miami and elsewhere, these problems are widespread and national in scope. To create public safety, communities and police must work together, and that is only possible if residents have confidence that they’ll be treated fairly, within the law and with respect. In far too many places, victims are more afraid of the police than of the people who victimized them. If a domestic violence victim won’t call 911 for fear that her abuser or a bystander will end up dead; if a witness to a shooting won’t talk to the police because there is no trust; if the father of a child with mental illness is afraid of what the police will do to his daughter if he calls for help, everyone in the community is less safe. When a police officer walks down the street in a neighborhood where systemic abuse has eroded confidence, she is less safe and less effective. Only through reforms like those resulting from a civil rights investigation can trust be restored. Arguing against DOJ intervention, Sessions claims that it’s “disrespectful [to police] for the feds to go in and try to take it over. ” The problem in policing is not bad police officers. All but a few officers are dedicated and honorable public servants. But police do what they have been taught to do, within the culture of their institutions. This is a systems problem, not an individual officer problem, and our investigations target systems. Sessions would be well served to recall that the Constitution is the most fundamental law in our democracy. The routine violation of basic rights by law enforcement officers is a public safety crisis and one that the Justice Department is in the strongest position to address."

When he woke up, his left one was missing.",Washington Post,Amy B Wang,2017-06-18,2017.0,6.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170619000006/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/06/18/he-underwent-surgery-to-remove-his-right-testicle-when-he-woke-up-his-left-one-was-missing/
","     In 2013, Steven Hanes visited his urologist, complaining of persistent pain in his right testicle. An ultrasound revealed that the testicle had atrophied, with scarring and damage from a previous injury, according to court documents. And so the doctor scheduled an orchiectomy  —   or surgical removal of the testicle  —   to help alleviate Hanes’s pain. The good news? The orchiectomy was successful. The bad news? The doctor removed the wrong testicle during the surgery. “At this point it appeared that the left testicle and cord may actually have been removed instead of the right one,” the surgeon, Valley Spencer Long, wrote in a postoperative report, according to court records. The mistake prompted Hanes in 2014 to file a medical malpractice lawsuit against Long and J. C. Blair Memorial Hospital in central Pennsylvania, citing negligence on the part of both. Four years after the surgical mistake, a Pennsylvania jury reached a verdict last week, awarding Hanes $870, 000, including $250, 000 in punitive damages, according to Hanes’s attorney, Braden Lepisto. “This case, I understand why it kind of went viral just because of what is involved, but the reality is, it’s a condition that has affected my client significantly,” Lepisto told The Washington Post. “Although some people may see it as kind of laughing matter initially, the award was completely justified based on the evidence and the toll that it’s taken on Steve. ”   [Do you need complex surgery? Some doctors may not have much practice.]   To this day, he added, “it’s still not totally clear” how the mistake occurred in the operating room. “The doctor gave an explanation that really made no anatomical or medical sense,” Lepisto said. “He claimed that he removed the testicle that was on the right side of the scrotum and the testicle had a spermatic cord that led to the left side of the body. “Essentially, the doctor claimed that the testicles had switched sides at some point. ” Lepisto said the jury  —   which comprised 11 women and one man  —   deliberated for about 1 hour 20 minutes before siding with the plaintiff. Reached by email Saturday, a spokeswoman for J. C. Blair Memorial Hospital did not offer further comment on the case but confirmed Long was no longer working for the hospital. Although horrifying, cases in which doctors operate on the wrong body part are extremely rare. A 2006 study supported by the public Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality analyzed nearly 3 million operations over nearly two decades, and found that   surgery occurred in only about 1 in 112, 994 cases. Still, it does happen. A 2011 Post roundup of such cases included doctors in Minneapolis removing a healthy kidney from a man with kidney cancer and an ophthalmologist in Portland, Ore. operating on the wrong eye of a    boy. “Few medical errors are as vivid and terrifying as those that involve patients who have undergone surgery on the wrong body part, undergone the incorrect procedure, or had a procedure intended for another patient,” the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services says.   [A simple checklist prevents deaths after surgery, a large new study suggests]   In the medical community, “      errors” are known as WSPEs, and they are so egregious and usually preventable that the federal health department deems them “never events”  —   “errors that should never occur and indicate serious underlying safety problems. ” In a 2011 report, the nonprofit Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare recommended a number of ways to prevent wrong site surgery, from marking the incision sites with something consistent (like the surgeon’s initials) before the operation to reducing noise and other possible distractions in the operating room. In Hanes’s case, Lepisto said the surgeon could have taken steps to confirm he was operating on the correct testicle. “If he had just tracked that spermatic cord up into the body, that would have told him which side he was on,” he said. “It’s just extremely unlikely because there are structures in the body that prevent the testicles from moving freely from one side to the other. There was just no evidence that those structures had been compromised. ” Lepisto said Hanes continues to suffer pain in his right testicle  —   the one that was supposed to have been removed  —   but has avoided seeking further medical treatment. Even if Hanes does have the remaining testicle removed, he would then need lifelong testosterone replacement therapy, he added. “He really is just extremely fearful of trying to get any sort of treatment for it at this point because of what happened,” Lepisto said.

"," LAST WINTER, bitter cold on the East Coast prompted Sen. James M. Inhofe ( .) to take a snowball onto the Senate floor in mockery of climate scientists. This winter, the weather is so warm that there are not two snowflakes in the Washington area for Mr. Inhofe to scrape together.  Just as last winter’s cold did not disprove global warming, this winter’s warmth does not, in itself, establish that humans are raising Earth’s average temperature. Rather, it is the   trend that matters  —   and that is concerning. The past decade was warmer than the previous one, which was warmer than the one before that, and so on. So far, this decade looks sure to fit into that trend.  We may, too, be getting a taste of what a warming world feels like. According to a 2014 paper, one potential effect is a doubling of the number of strong El Niño years. That’s the phenomenon that has perturbed the jet stream and pushed this winter’s temperatures up. Though the El Niño variation predated human influence, it, among many other natural cycles, probably will not be immune to it. And even if this year’s El Niño cannot be blamed squarely on climate change, it nevertheless feels like a fitting end to a remarkable year in the policy and politics of global warming.  For those following the climate debate, 2015 brought some inspiring highs  —   and disheartening lows. President Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency finalized landmark carbon dioxide regulations that promise to slash greenhouse gas emissions from U. S. power plants. This policy played a crucial role in galvanizing the international climate effort, which culminated last month in a huge international climate deal. The Paris agreement will not cut emissions enough to avoid serious risks. But it will get the world a good chunk of the way there, and it represents the beginning of a process in which all major emitters will be expected to step up.  The very same EPA rules also inspired a race among Republicans to embarrass themselves. A standard critique, such as that of Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) was to argue that climate regulations will uselessly harm the economy; that exaggerates the potential costs without acknowledging the unprecedented global agreement the measure helped to produce. Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) went further, holding a hearing on climate science with a witness list that was a   image of the scientific community: short on those who accept mainstream climate science, packed with climate critics.  Mr. Cruz insisted that there has been a “pause” in global warming since 1998, a date critics choose as their starting point because it was another El Niño year marked by very high temperatures. Like Mr. Inhofe and his snowball, Mr. Cruz’s point ignored the   nature of the warming trend. It also might be flatly wrong: A June paper in the   journal Science found that the warming “pause” reflected biases in temperature data rather than a significant plateau in real temperature rise.  Alas, this finding also led to a nasty GOP reaction. House Science, Space and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (Tex.) subpoenaed emails relating to the study, which came from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Congressional oversight of federal spending is important. That’s no excuse to conduct fishing expeditions designed to personally discredit scientists and undermine   research with lines from informal emails. With the events of the past year in mind, the presidential candidates  —   and American voters  —   must ask themselves: Do they want to build on 2015’s climate progress, or do they want more of last year’s climate buffoonery?

","  DES MOINES  —   By the numbers, Ted Cruz won the Iowa caucuses. The technical winner among the Democrats is unclear but immaterial. Judging the victor by differences of tenths of a percentage point is a ridiculous enterprise when what’s being measured are delegate numbers, not tens of thousands of individual votes.  Still, the race for the top spot was not the big news of the night. The real winners were Marco Rubio, with his remarkably strong   showing, and Bernie Sanders, with his virtual tie.   Ruth Marcus is a columnist for The Post, specializing in American politics and domestic policy. View Archive   Facebook RSS   In the short term, Donald Trump was the biggest loser  —   true of any   but even truer of a candidate whose campaign raison d’etre is that he is a winner. Yet in the longer term, if the legacy of Iowa is to propel Rubio to the nomination  —   granted, a big if at this point  —   the biggest loser could be Hillary Clinton. On the Republican side, the Iowa results put Rubio in a strong position to break away from the crowded establishment pack and claim the mantle of alternative to Cruz and Trump.  Not to take away credit from Cruz for being the  . He upended   polling expectations and demonstrated the power of dogged organization. The elaborate network of evangelical support and intensive voter contact and analytics he constructed outdid the swaggering        approach of Donald Trump.   Here are reactions from seven presidential candidates on the evening of the 2016 Iowa caucuses. (Sarah   Washington Post)   But in addition to the impressive Cruz ground game, Monday’s results illustrate the limitations of Trump’s appeal. There may be some element of wishful thinking in this assessment, but I think something more is going on as well. All week long in Iowa, I interviewed undecided Republican voters. They were torn  —   except when it came to Trump. He had been crossed off almost all their lists, as too big a   too politically inexperienced, too ideologically untrustworthy. Their choices, for the most part, came down to Cruz and Rubio.  That Rubio came within a percentage point of passing Trump  —   the candidate leading in most polls leading up to the caucuses  —   is the most significant number of the night. Rubio’s   is bad news for Chris Christie, Jeb Bush and John Kasich. New Hampshire is not obviously fertile territory for Cruz; it is better suited to Rubio.  There, he can dial down the   appeals to evangelical voters and amp up his appealing life story. I left the Rubio events I attended here with a revived sense that Clinton should be very nervous about the prospect of facing him in a general election campaign. Assuming, as I still do, that she gets there. The closeness of the Democratic outcome offers concrete electoral proof of the power of Sanders’s   appeal. Between Sanders and Clinton, tie goes to the underdog. If you have any question about this, ask yourself: Which campaign was celebrating Monday night, and which was trying to figure out what went wrong? Eight years ago, Iowa dealt a terrible blow to Hillary Clinton. This year it did not so much harm her as prevent her from harming Sanders by stemming his momentum heading into the   territory of New Hampshire. On the Democratic side, the prospect of a functional tie in Iowa and Sanders win in New Hampshire does not augur the end of Clinton’s candidacy  —   far from it. This was not the start she wanted, but   Hampshire calendar is far more favorable to her demographically.  Yet Iowa proved Sanders’s ability to compete on a par with Clinton, whose organization had far more time and resources on the ground in Iowa. His   prowess is significant, and with a huge upside of donors who have not come close to giving the maximum amount allowed.    Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders addressed his supporters following the Iowa caucus results. (Reuters)   It was telling that Clinton campaign officials diverted her, several days before the caucuses, to a fundraising event in Philadelphia  —   incurring the predictable criticism from Sanders that she was once again raising money from financial interests. In short, Sanders is not disappearing any time soon. Trump is not running away with the nomination. For both parties, the Iowa results reinforce the likelihood that both nomination battles will stretch well into the spring, if not beyond.

","     Focus groups of swing voters have picked up some warning signs for Democrats about Donald Trump’s general election candidacy: While those swing voters are willing to see Trump as a risky, divisive figure, they are not yet prepared to believe the Dem argument that Trump’s policy proposals would benefit the rich, a senior Democratic strategist who has been directly involved in extensive focus groups tells me. The findings in these focus groups present Democrats with both challenges and opportunities as they prepare for a very harsh general election campaign against Trump. They also may help explain the brutal onslaught of attacks on Trump we’re about to see from Democrats as the primaries wind down and the July conventions approach. The focus groups were conducted in a range of presidential swing states, and targeted mostly suburban women, but also blue collar women. The findings were described to me by the senior Dem strategist on the condition that he and his affiliation remain anonymous. The key finding from the focus groups, this Dem strategist told me, is that they revealed a divide in terms of how swing voters currently view Trump when it comes to temperament on the one hand, and policy on the other. “Focus groups right now show voters are willing to believe that Trump is risky and divisive, but not yet ready to believe that Trump would cut taxes on the rich,” the strategist told me. “They aren’t ready to think policy as it relates to Trump yet,” the strategist continued. “It’s all wrapped in the politics of personality right now. His policy ideas aren’t defined to them yet  —   other than the bombastic ones, like building a wall. ” That’s a reference to Trump’s promise of a Great Trumpian Wall on the southern border. In recent days, Hillary Clinton’s campaign has sought to increase scrutiny of Trump’s economic policies. Senior Clinton advisers yesterday held a conference call with reporters, in which they argued that Trump’s tax plan would lavish a huge windfall on the wealthy and blow a massive hole in the deficit, an effort to make the case that Trump’s economic agenda is every bit as reckless and crazy as, well, pretty much everything else about him. On the Sunday shows, Trump tried to confuse the issue by creating the impression that he might be open to raising taxes on the rich, but he ultimately confirmed that, yes, he will indeed cut them. The question is what swing voters will believe, and these focus groups suggest a good deal of uncertainty among swing voters about where Trump actually stands on the economy, this Dem strategist tells me. This mirrors what happened in 2012 with Mitt Romney. Early in that campaign, Dem focus groups revealed that voters weren’t prepared to believe that Romney actually would do what his economic agenda called for. The relentless attacks on Romney as a heartless plutocrat and outsourcer were about getting voters to perceive Romney’s personal priorities in a way that made them more willing to accept the truth about his policies. But this time around, Trump poses a different challenge than Romney did. Whereas Romney was a venture capitalist with an aloof, plutocratic manner who really did fervently support the Paul Ryan    ideological vision of deep cuts to the safety net, Trump is posing as a kind of Man In The Street’s Billionaire. He brashly boasts about his wealth, openly brags that he has worked the elites’ scam from the inside and is thus the guy best positioned to break up their party, promises to make you and all of America filthy rich along with himself, and doesn’t parrot Republican nostrums about the magic of supply side economics or the need to “reform” entitlements. He rhetorically vows to target hedge funders and people like himself with higher taxes (though as we’ve seen, this is a total scam). Trump, meanwhile, has all sorts of vulnerabilities that Romney didn’t, having spent months vowing to carry out mass deportations and ban Muslims, insulting women and immigrants, and shouting vulgarities at angry crowds across the country. The Dem focus grouping shows that swing voters are prepared to believe that Trump is a frightening, dangerous figure. But they don’t know where he stands on the economy  —   which could create an opportunity, allowing Dems to fill in that picture. And so what we may now see is a two tiered attack. First there may be a relentless focus on the stuff about Trump that voters are currently prepared to accept: His sexism, xenophobia, bigotry, and unfitness to serve as president. This could energize core Dem voting groups (nonwhites, young voters, socially liberal   whites) and perhaps sow further doubts about his temperament with swing voting constituencies (particularly suburban, independent, blue collar, and moderate   women). There may also be an all out assault on the seamy underside of his business record, as is reportedly being worked up. The question will then be whether all of this  —   particularly the attack on his business dealings  —   will lay the groundwork for a successful prosecution of Trump’s economic agenda and worldview. Trump has a very simple economic message: The elites have screwed you with trade deals that have sucked jobs out of the country. He’d bring them roaring back by kicking the asses of other countries, international bureaucrats and elites, CEOs who ship jobs overseas, and immigrants who are eating out of American workers’ lunch buckets. If this focus grouping is right, the challenge for Democrats, in addition to cranking up core Dem groups, will be to persuade swing voters not just that Trump is wholly unfit for the job, but that he’s also running a massive economic con. Will savaging his temperament and business dealings successfully prime those voters to accept this argument? Maybe. If that isn’t enough, the Clinton campaign might have to do better at making a broad, affirmative argument on behalf of her economic agenda, one that tries to directly rebut the appeal of the story Trump is telling about the economy. Fortunately, all signs are Democrats are already thinking hard about how to do that, too.  "
141384,212158,The foggy numbers of Obama’s wars and non-wars,Washington Post,Karen DeYoung,2016-05-22,2016.0,5.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160523003648/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-foggy-numbers-of-obamas-wars-and-non-wars/2016/05/22/5648b798-1d2f-11e6-b6e0-c53b7ef63b45_story.html
"," As the Obama administration prepares to publish a   accounting of how many militants and noncombatant civilians it has killed since 2009, its statistics may be defined as much by what is left out as by what is included. Release of the information was first envisioned three years ago this month, as part of strict new guidelines President Obama announced for the United States’ controversial use of drones and other forms of lethal force to battle terrorism abroad. Such operations, Obama said in a 2013 speech at the National Defense University, would also be subject to new transparency and oversight.  [Obama: U. S. at ‘crossroads’ in fight against terrorism]  The death tolls, like the guidelines, will cover places where the United States conducts airstrikes but does not consider itself officially at war: Yemen, Somalia and Libya. They are likely to exclude Pakistan, where the CIA has conducted hundreds of drone strikes but which the administration has long labeled part of the Afghanistan war theater. The United States still does not publicly acknowledge CIA attacks inside Pakistan, although the Pentagon announced Saturday that it had targeted Taliban leader Akhtar Mohammad Mansour in Pakistan. Not all strikes in the included countries are considered counterterrorism actions, which must be approved by the highest level of government. With U. S. Special Operations forces deployed to all three places, some strikes are defined as   and can be approved by the defense secretary.   In speeches in 2013 and 2016, President Obama stressed that the U. S. tries to avoid civilian deaths as a result of drone strikes  —   but doesn’t always succeed. (The Washington Post)   That was the case on March 5 in Somalia, when manned and unmanned aircraft killed an estimated 150   militants at a training camp, the largest such   strike ever, and on May 12, when U. S. forces called in an airstrike after African peacekeeping troops they were accompanying were attacked by militants west of Mogadishu, the Somali capital. The totals will almost inevitably be challenged by independent groups that keep their own tallies and for years have charged that the administration undercounts civilian deaths caused by drone strikes. Beyond debates over statistics, there are broader questions about how, when and where Obama’s guidelines apply, how they have changed amid a mutating threat, including the growth of the Islamic State, and what standing they will have after the president completes his term in January.   [In Syria, Obama stretches legal and policy constraints he created for counterterrorism]  “My hope is, is that by the time I leave office, there is not only an internal structure in place that governs these standards we’ve set” but also an “institutionalized process . . . so that people can look” at actions taken by their government on an “annualized basis,” Obama said last month.  The pending announcement will also be accompanied by additional information on the guidelines, perhaps elevating them to an executive order, according to several senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss information that has not been made public. How Obama plans to impose the standards he has set on future administrations is unclear. “We have a system for making rules that will bind across time that involves statutes passed, treaties adopted, constitutional change, etc. ,” said Robert M. Chesney, associate dean and director of the Robert S. Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas’s law school.  “It’s just not possible, as a legal matter, for decisions of one administration to become binding in a legal sense on their successors  —   any more than Obama was bound” by policies and rules imposed by his predecessor, George W. Bush. At the time the guidelines were written,   missiles appeared to have become Obama’s counterterrorism weapon of choice. By early 2013, he had launched hundreds of strikes, most of them in Pakistan, compared with around 50 throughout the Bush administration.  [U. S. drone strikes in Pakistan on rise for 2013]  But the president and his top advisers were concerned that the program had too few controls and publicly stated justifications under international law. The secrecy that necessarily surrounded it  —   virtually all Pakistan strikes have been conducted by the CIA and are considered covert actions  —   limited the ways in which they could defend it. While acknowledging that some civilian deaths had occurred, they said that claims of hundreds or more deaths by   organizations have been wildly inaccurate. Obama himself recalled the dilemma in a news conference last month, saying that “there’s been, in the past, legitimate criticism that the . . . legal architecture around the use of drone strikes or other kinetic strikes wasn’t as precise as it should have been, and there’s no doubt that civilians were killed that shouldn’t have been. ” The beginning of 2013 seemed the right time to promulgate new rules. With the end of the Iraq War, the planned U. S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the perceived diminishment of   senior administration officials said, there would be less need for drone strikes.  The goal was to establish a   legal and procedural framework for those occasions that required them. With operations in Pakistan gradually ending, the CIA would be eased out of the business of lethal attacks, and they would become the sole responsibility of the military. The guidelines were only applicable to   zones  —   places defined as “outside areas of active hostilities. ” A policy term that does not appear in the international laws of war, the concept can theoretically be applied anywhere in the world and has been a subject of sharp debate among   experts. The United States justifies its counterterrorism attacks under a variety of domestic and international laws. The Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress in 2001 allows force to prevent further attacks by   responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks that year, and the government for more than a decade has construed this to include  ’s “associated forces. ”  A complete list of “associated forces” has never been released, although both Bush and Obama have said it includes     in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, and Obama has said individuals in   with AQAP ties can be subject to counterterrorism strikes. The administration also considers the Islamic State part of   despite the bitter rivalry between the groups, while it has unsuccessfully pressed Congress for a new AUMF to cover the Islamic State more specifically.  Article II of the Constitution gives the commander in chief powers to defend the country. It is a provision frequently cited by Bush and eschewed by Obama at the beginning of his administration, but later incorporated into his lexicon of legal justifications. International law allows countries to defend themselves and their allies in the event of an “armed attack,” which the government has interpreted as extending to preventive defense against defined terrorists wherever they are located. When the administration announced its new rules for counterterrorism, it said they went beyond those required by law. Under the 2013 guidelines, deadly attacks would be used only against those groups and individuals posing a “continuing, imminent threat to U. S. persons,” a much smaller universe than the former “U. S. interests. ” Only the president could approve such strikes, and the   would be given only when there was a “near certainty” of no civilian deaths. Since the guidelines were  adopted, and released in an unclassified summary, the terrorism landscape has changed considerably, and the administration has struggled to keep up. Two countries  —   Iraq and Syria  —   have been added to the list of designated war zones, where the military and the international laws of war impose somewhat different rules. The Islamic State, officially born in 2014, has spread its tentacles across the Middle East and North Africa. “We are continuously refining, clarifying, and strengthening our standards and procedures for reviewing and approving direct action against terrorist targets located . . . outside areas of active hostilities,” a senior administration official said of the rules, officially known as the counterterrorism PPG, for Presidential Policy Guidance. The reduced number of lethal actions predicted three years ago by administration officials has come to pass, but almost all of the reduction has been in Pakistan, where the number of strikes has steadily fallen from a high of more than 100 in 2010 to only two reported by outside observers so far this year before Saturday’s military strike. But the focus of U. S. activities has expanded elsewhere, outside the war zones. In Yemen, the number of airstrikes peaked in 2012, fell over the next two years, and has begun to rise again this year. In Somalia, it has increased steadily since the PPG was first announced. Two airstrikes on alleged terrorist targets this year in Libya were the first since the 2011 joint air offensive by the United States and European allies that ousted Moammar Gaddafi. For those outside the government trying to tally them, the number of recent counterterrorism strikes has been muddied by the separate category of defense for Special Operations forces on the ground and the fact that some strikes, but not all, are publicly announced. In emailed responses to written questions, the Defense Department said it keeps no central list of strikes “outside areas of active hostilities. ” Some are announced by the Pentagon, some by Central Command in charge of Yemen, and others by the Africa Command. Some are not made public at all, “consistent with operational security,” the response said. The CIA, whose drone strikes remain secret, is still thought to be operating drones in Yemen. Since the beginning of November, official releases have documented about half of more than 30 U. S. strikes  —   more than half in Yemen, two in Libya and the rest in Somalia  —   as compiled by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, one of several organizations that count them based on local reporting and other sources. Independent counts of civilian deaths in individual operations are zero or in low single digits, far reduced from previous years’ tallies. “We are committed to transparency,” the Defense Department said. “While not all strikes are announced or publicly acknowledged in real time, information on all of our strikes taken outside areas of active hostilities will be aggregated for release in future annual releases. ”  Julie Tate contributed to this report.

","     Sen. Bernie Sanders said Sunday that he would have liked to see Hillary Clinton pick a more progressive running mate, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( .) and offered tepid praise of her choice of Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (Va. ). After staying mum for a couple of days, Sanders, the   in the Democratic primaries, weighed in during Sunday talk show appearances, calling Kaine ”very, very smart” and ”a very nice guy.” Sanders, a senator from Vermont, said Kaine is more conservative than he is, but is ”100 times better” than the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump. “Would I have preferred to see someone like an Elizabeth Warren selected by Secretary Clinton? Yes, I would have,” Sanders said on NBC’s ”Meet the Press.”   [Sen. Timothy M. Kaine of Virginia chosen as Hillary Clinton’s VP]   His comments come at a time when some of Sanders’s supporters are expressing disappointment in Kaine, suggesting that Clinton snubbed the left wing of the party. ”Are his political views different than mine?” Sanders said on CNN’s ”State of the Union” when asked about Kaine. ”Yeah, they are. He’s more conservative than I am.” Sanders then teed off on Trump, saying the Republican nominee doesn’t believe climate change is real, favors tax breaks for the wealthy and has insulted Latinos, Muslims, women, veterans and African Americans. ”Trust me, on his worst, worst, worst day, Tim Kaine is 100 times better than Donald Trump will ever be,” Sanders said. Sanders, who has endorsed Clinton, encouraged his supporters to vote for the ticket, saying the top priority in the November election is to defeat Trump. Clinton aides, meanwhile, have been seeking to counter complaints from some progressive groups about Kaine’s bona fides on their issues. “I don’t think anybody’s disappointed,’’ Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, said on the CNN program. ”Look, Tim Kaine is a progressive fighter. . .. This is someone that the progressive community can be proud of. ”"

","     It seems that the second time’s the charm for Major League Baseball’s favorite   lovers, Nats slugger Bryce Harper and fiancee Kayla Varner, who finally tied the knot this weekend. According to the Nats fan site TalkNats. com, Harper and Varner got married this weekend (it’s still unclear whether the wedding took place Friday or Saturday) at the Mormon temple in San Diego.   cannot attend an official temple wedding, so the ceremony was probably much smaller than the postnuptial celebration, which reportedly included Harper’s teammates Jayson Werth and Trea Turner. Nats GM Mike Rizzo also was in attendance. Since mysteriously nixing their original plans to get hitched in 2015, high school sweethearts Varner and Harper had been flying under the radar. A period of   freezeout followed the postponement, but then this summer, Varner announced their engagement (for the second time) on Instagram with a photo of the lovebirds at the 2016 Espy Awards.      ESPYS last night with my love. So proud of you, B!

But Varner did post a photo of her dress, though safely hidden from prying eyes in an opaque garment bag, three weeks ago. And when one Nats beat reporter tweeted that Harper was unable to attend a fan appreciation event in Washington last week because of a “long scheduled prior commitment,” Varner responded in a   tweet “Yeah a wedding . . . ”    Instagram user @kylie_cardon captioned this photo of her and Kayla Varner: “My best friend got sealed to her man today!
