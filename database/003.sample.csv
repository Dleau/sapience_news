76,17371,"Philippines Jailbreak Frees More Than 150 Inmates, Prompting Manhunt - The New York Times",New York Times,Felipe Villamor,2017-01-05,2017.0,1.0,,"MANILA  —   A manhunt was underway Wednesday for more than 150 inmates who escaped from a jail in the southern Philippines after it came under attack by gunmen overnight. One guard was killed and another wounded in the assault on a jail in Kidapawan City on the   southern island of Mindanao, according to Peter Bungat, the warden. The gunmen were thought to be from a bandit group that had broken away from a Muslim rebel organization, Mr. Bungat told a radio station on Mindanao, which is home to a   insurgency. Five of the 158 inmates who escaped from the facility, the North Cotabato District Jail, were later killed in a shootout with pursuing officers, Senior Inspector Xavier Solda, a spokesman for the Philippine Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, told a radio station in Manila. A village official was also killed when he was mistaken for one of the escaped inmates, the police said. Mr. Bungat said the attack began early Wednesday, when the jail’s power supply was cut. Armed men then approached from behind the compound and began firing. “It was well planned,” Mr. Bungat said. He said it was unclear whether any “high profile” inmates were among the escapees. At least a dozen were involved in drug trafficking, according to officials from the jail management bureau. Mr. Bungat said the assault was believed to have been led by a bandit known as Commander Derbie, who once led a faction of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the Philippines’ largest rebel group. Commander Derbie is widely believed to have broken away from that organization, which has signed a peace deal with the government. Philippine security officials have said that Commander Derbie joined a breakaway group called the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters. A spokesman for that group, Abu Misry, denied any involvement in the jailbreak. Ernesto Abella, a spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte, said there was no “specific information” as to the identities of the gunmen, “though speculation is rife. ” Three inmates who had been charged with possessing drugs and explosives escaped from the North Cotabato District Jail last August. Eight years ago, three inmates accused of carrying out a bombing also escaped from the jail."
152,17459,The Making of Virtually Real Art With Google’s Tilt Brush - The New York Times,New York Times,Frank Rose,2017-01-06,2017.0,1.0,,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   In 1949, a Life magazine photographer named Gjon Mili made a pilgrimage to the French Riviera to see Pablo Picasso. Mili had come up with a way to photograph trails of light, and he wanted to shoot Picasso “drawing” in midair with a light pen  —   a process that would leave no trace except on film. Picasso loved it. The result, published in Life and exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, was Picasso’s celebrated series of “light drawings” of bulls and centaurs and the like  —   photographs that captured him in the act of creating the ultimate in ephemeral art. Picasso is long gone. But some 68 years later, Google has been calling on dozens of artists, animators and illustrators with a   update of Mili’s concept  —   a virtual reality setup that enables people to paint with light that actually stays where you put it, at least for viewers wearing a VR headset. In place of Gjon Mili are Drew Skillman and Patrick Hackett, a pair of video game developers turned virtual reality enthusiasts who live in San Francisco. They were trying to build a   chess application one night a couple of years ago when they discovered it had an unexpected side effect: As you moved the chess pieces around in virtual space, they left trails of light behind. Sensing that their bug was in fact a feature, the two dropped the chess project immediately and hurled themselves at the light trails, hoping to develop a tool for drawing in three dimensions. In April 2015, seven months after they had cobbled together a rudimentary system they called Tilt Brush, Google bought their company for an undisclosed sum  —   which is how Mr. Skillman and Mr. Hackett have come to be ensconced in the company’s offices near the downtown waterfront here. With Google’s support, Tilt Brush has attracted a team of developers and evolved into a sophisticated tool for drawing, painting, even sculpting in space. It was released in April as a free   to the new HTC Vive, an $800 virtual reality system produced by the Taiwanese manufacturer HTC in partnership with Valve, an American video game developer. (It’s on sale as a $30 software package from Valve’s online store.) Reviewers immediately dubbed it the Vive’s killer app. This is hardly the kind of reception the two inventors were expecting when they started working on it in Mr. Skillman’s apartment, a    studio in South Park, the little neighborhood that has been a hub for San Francisco’s digerati since the 1990s. “Not in our wildest dreams,” said Mr. Skillman, a slightly built    with a neatly trimmed beard and a modest, unassuming manner. Tilt Brush got its name because in its earliest versions, you would draw or paint on a   surface that could be tilted in any direction in virtual space. But because the HTC Vive includes not just a virtual reality headset but also a pair of   controllers and two tracking sensors that map your movement in space, the program was revamped to enable you to paint or draw anywhere within a   area  —   no surface required. One controller serves as a palette, with dozens of colors and effects the other acts as a brush or pen. To watch someone use it is a bit unnerving, since the person appears to be making marks in midair, but you can’t actually see those. But put on a Vive headset and step between the sensors yourself  —   as I did in a windowless room in Google’s New York offices  —   and the illusion of delusion disappears. Instead, you suddenly see what has been produced: a phantom creation in three dimensions, something you can walk around, walk through, poke your head inside, do everything except touch. Google’s investment in virtual reality pales beside Facebook’s $2 billion purchase of the VR pioneer Oculus. Still, Tilt Brush is part of a growing effort, one that began with the introduction in 2014 of supercheap cardboard headsets that work with smartphones, and continues with the recent release of a stunning virtual reality version of Google Earth as a free download for Vive owners. Over the past year, Google has invited more than 60 people to try Tilt Brush and offer feedback, and this week the company is unveiling their work and participation. “You would never want to create an artistic tool with only engineers,” said Mr. Skillman. “That’s just absurd. ” According to Tory Voight, Google’s Tilt Brush program manager, those who have joined this    program include Dustin Yellin, a Brooklyn artist known for his   collages encased in layers of glass, and Jonathan Yeo, a British painter whose portrait of Kevin Spacey as the fictional American president Francis J. Underwood was exhibited last year at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery. Jeff Koons, whose art works have sold at auction for as much as $58 million, had early access, though he was not part of the artists in residence program. Bob Mankoff, Roz Chast and other cartoonists for The New Yorker have also checked it out, as has Alex Hirsch, the young animator behind Disney’s hit television series “Gravity Falls. ” Last June, Mr. Hirsch posted a sample creation on Twitter along with an enthusiastic status update: “Drawing in virtual reality makes you feel like a   wizard god!” But the first to try it was Glen Keane, a   figure who in his 37 years at Disney had brought the warmth of   animation to such characters as Ariel (in “The Little Mermaid”) Aladdin, Tarzan and Pocahontas. “When I left Disney in 2012,” Mr. Keane said recently in his studio, a vintage bungalow on a quiet residential street in West Hollywood, Calif. “I told them it was because I know there’s something new coming  —   I don’t know what it is, but I need to leave to find it. ” He was still looking when he met Regina Dugan, then the leader of Google’s secretive Advanced Technology and Products group, which was experimenting with virtual reality. First he partnered with the group to make a   virtual reality short called “Duet,” a charming piece released in 2014 about two babies growing up that was shortlisted for an Academy Award. “Duet” broke new ground, since animation in virtual reality had almost exclusively been  . But though he’d spent a lifetime drawing on paper, Mr. Keane had always dreamed of being able to make the paper disappear. “The goal would be to animate not on paper but in space,” he said. Enter Tilt Brush, which Mr. Keane encountered when Mr. Skillman introduced himself at a visual effects conference in San Francisco. Though still in a primitive state, it was maturing rapidly, and Mr. Keane soon became a convert. In September 2015, seven months before its release, he previewed its capabilities with “Step Into the Page,” a   video. “The edges of the paper are no longer there,” he exclaimed in a   as he did a loose, freehand sketch of Ariel in virtual space. “This is not a flat drawing. This is sculptural drawing. ” Scott McCloud, the graphic artist whose book “Understanding Comics” is considered the ultimate guide to the art form, got to play with Tilt Brush when Google invited him to its Silicon Valley headquarters in August. “I don’t mind saying, I’m a little bit obsessed with this program,” he said as we sat in his small,   office in a mall in the Los Angeles exurb of Thousand Oaks. “One thing that appeals to me the most is, it’s still very early. Everyone is asking fundamental questions. We’re still trying to figure out what people are going to use it for. I love it when technology is in that stage. ” So, what are people going to use it for? Mr. McCloud threw out a few suggestions: performance art, virtual sculpture, industrial prototyping. “I doodle with it,” said Mr. Yeo, the painter, who spoke by telephone from London. “I describe it as a   sketchbook. ” What it won’t produce is anything resembling comics as they currently exist in the medium some call “Flatland. ” For denizens of Flatland who have learned to work within the constraints of   this can be problematic. Mr. Mankoff, the cartoon editor at The New Yorker, came up with some characteristically     drawings during the two days he spent using Tilt Brush with Ms. Chast and other colleagues at Google’s New York offices. But though he professes to have enjoyed the experience, he seems unlikely to lead The New Yorker out of Flatland. “You’ll probably find a sharp divide between older and younger cartoonists,” he said. “Or it may just not work  —   but that’s no reason not to try it. ” One suggestion the New Yorker team had: cubes and cylinders and other   shapes to draw on, “so you’re not starting from zero in   space. ” (Google has since implemented a similar idea.) Other than that, Mr. Mankoff offered with a grin: “The advice I would have for Google is, more cats. You can’t go wrong with cats. ” Mr. Keane has a different item on his wish list. Currently, works created in Tilt Brush are as motionless as a New Yorker cartoon. They’re essentially static, and Mr. Keane is an animator. “To me, the thing to conquer is to be able to animate in real time in space,” he said as I viewed a Tilt Brush drawing called “Victory Dance” in his studio. The piece captures a brief moment in time, seconds after his daughter’s high school choir had won a national championship  —   but it begs to be brought to life. “Just like you have a spatial dimension, you’ve got to have time as a dimension,” Mr. Keane continued. “There’s no reason you can’t do that. I’m not smart enough to figure it out. But Drew is. ”"
168,17476,Can Evolution Have a ‘Higher Purpose’? - The New York Times,New York Times,Robert Wright,2017-01-09,2017.0,1.0,,"About 25 years ago, a conversation between me and one of the greatest biologists of the 20th century took a weird turn. I was talking to William D. Hamilton, who was famous for coming up with the theory of “kin selection,” which explains patterns of altruism among close relatives in various species, including ours. This and other seminal ideas had earned Hamilton a place in the pantheon of thinkers who ushered in the modern Darwinian understanding of social behavior. Richard Dawkins, in the preface to his landmark 1976 book,“The Selfish Gene,” paid tribute to Hamilton and the three other “dominant figures” in social biology whose ideas formed the book’s foundation. I was interviewing Hamilton at the University of Michigan, where he was on sabbatical from Oxford. A video camera was rolling. I had been researching a book about evolutionary psychology, and I was hoping to create a documentary on the subject. The documentary never materialized, and Hamilton died in early 2000. My interview with him sat unwatched until earlier this year, when I tracked down the tape containing it. During the interview, I was trying to steer Hamilton toward philosophical topics, and at one point he went further than I had expected. He said, “I’m also quite open to the view that there is some kind of ultimate good which is of a religious nature  —   that we just have to look beyond what the evolutionary theory tells us and accept promptings of what ultimate good is, coming from some other source. ” That’s an unusual thing for a great evolutionary biologist to say, but the most unusual part was still to come. Hamilton continued, in his British accent, “I could enlarge on that in terms of the possible existence of extraterrestrial manipulators who interfere, and so on, but I think this would be getting too far from the general topic of discussion. ” Well, maybe, but this sounded at least as interesting as the general topic of discussion. I asked him if he meant that there was some kind of “transcendental purpose” that we humans are generally oblivious to. He answered: “Yes, yes. There’s one theory of the universe that I rather like  —   I accept it in an almost joking spirit  —   and that is that Planet Earth in our solar system is a kind of zoo for extraterrestrial beings who dwell out there somewhere. And this is the best, the most interesting experiment they could set up: to set up the evolution on Planet Earth going in such a way that it would produce these really interesting characters  —   humans who go around doing things  —   and they watch their experiment, interfering hardly at all so that almost everything we do comes out according to the laws of nature. But every now and then they see something which doesn’t look quite right  —   this zoo is going to kill itself off if they let you do this or that. ” So, he continued, these extraterrestrials “insert a finger and just change some little thing. And maybe those are the miracles which the religious people like to so emphasize. ” He reiterated: “I put it forward in an almost joking spirit. But I think it’s a kind of hypothesis that’s very, very hard to dismiss. ” The headline almost writes itself: “  Scientist Says Miracles Can Happen!” The subhead would add: “Extraterrestrials may play a role. ” But that’s the headline you’d write if you were just trying to maximize clicks. If you wanted to capture the philosophical significance of what Hamilton was saying, you’d take another tack. Rather than focus on miracles, you’d focus on the idea of “higher purpose”  —   the idea that there’s some point to life on earth that emanates from something that is in some sense beyond it. And  —   in hopes of generating as many clicks as possible, notwithstanding the philosophical significance  —   you’d put this in listicle form, laying out several misconceptions that Hamilton had implicitly dispelled. You could call these the “Three Great Myths About Evolution and Purpose. ” Myth number one: To say that there’s in some sense a “higher purpose” means there are “spooky forces” at work. When I ask scientifically minded people if they think life on earth may have some larger purpose, they typically say no. If I ask them to explain their view, it often turns out that they think that answering yes would mean departing from a scientific worldview  —   embracing the possibility of supernatural beings or, at the very least, of immaterial factors that lie beyond scientific measurement. But Hamilton’s thought experiment shows that this isn’t necessarily so. You may consider aliens spooky, but they’re not a spooky force. And they’re not supernatural beings. They’re just physical beings, like us. Their technology is so advanced that their interventions might seem miraculous to us  —   as various smartphone apps would seem to my      —   but these interventions would in fact comply with the laws of science. More to the point: If you ask how Hamilton’s aliens had initially imparted “purpose” to life, the answer is that they did so in concrete fashion: by planting simple   material on earth a few billion years ago, confident that it would lead to something that would keep them entertained (keeping them entertained being, in this scenario, life’s purpose). Which leads to: Myth number two: To say that evolution has a purpose is to say that it is driven by something other than natural selection.  The correction of this misconception is in some ways just a corollary of the correction of the first misconception, but it’s worth spelling out: Evolution can have a purpose even if it is a wholly mechanical, material process  —   that is, even if its sole engine is natural selection. After all, clocks have purposes  —   to keep time, a purpose imparted by clockmakers  —   and they’re wholly mechanical. Of course, to suggest that evolution involves the unfolding of some purpose is to suggest that evolution has in some sense been heading somewhere  —   namely, toward the realization of its purpose. Which leads to: Myth number three: Evolution couldn’t have a purpose, because it doesn’t have a direction. The idea that evolution is fundamentally directionless is widespread, in part because one great popularizer of evolution, Stephen Jay Gould, worked hard to leave that impression. As I and others have argued, Gould was at best misleading on this point. And, anyway, even Gould admitted that, yes, on balance evolution tends to create beings of greater and greater complexity. A number of evolutionary biologists would go further and say that evolution was likely, given long enough, to create animals as intelligent as us. In fact, that idea is implicit in Hamilton’s saying the aliens could have “set up” evolution in such a way that “it would produce these really interesting characters  —   humans. ” This part of Hamilton’s scenario requires no intervention on the part of the aliens, because he believed that evolution by natural selection has a kind of direction in the sense that it is likely, given long enough, to produce very intelligent forms of life. (When speaking more precisely, as he did in other parts of the interview, Hamilton would say that the human species per se wasn’t in the cards  —   that it wasn’t inevitable that the first intelligent species would look like us.) With these three myths dispelled, you’re left with this philosophically liberating upshot: You can entertain the possibility that evolution has a purpose, a kind of goal (a “telos,” as philosophers say) without departing from a strictly Darwinian view of evolution  —   without abandoning belief in natural selection as evolution’s only engine, and without surrendering your credentials as a modern, scientifically minded kind of person. In case you’re still feeling a little uneasy about becoming a purpose ponderer, I should emphasize that not all teleological scenarios that pass scientific muster involve space aliens. Indeed, some scientists have suggested that natural selection has a purpose that wasn’t instilled by any kind of intelligent being. This scenario emerges from one version of physicist Lee Smolin’s theory of “cosmological natural selection. ” Smolin thinks our universe may itself be a product of a kind of evolution: maybe universes can replicate themselves via black holes, so over time  —   over a lot of time  —   you get universes whose physical laws are more and more conducive to replication. (So that’s why our universe is so good at   making!) In some variants of Smolin’s theory  —   such as those developed by the late cosmologist Edward Harrison and the mathematician Louis Crane  —   intelligent beings can play a role in this replication once their technology reaches a point where they can produce black holes. So through cosmological natural selection you’d get universes whose physical properties were more and more conducive to the evolution of intelligent life. This might explain the   observation that the physical constants of this universe seem “ ” to permit the emergence of life. Crane, in a recent dialogue on my website meaningoflife. tv, told me that in this scenario “human life —  and I don’t mean on an individual scale, but as a whole —  has a purpose in the same sense that a chicken’s egg has a purpose. The purpose of a chicken’s egg is to create a chicken. ” Crane isn’t using language carelessly here. Some philosophers are comfortable talking about animals having a “purpose” imbued by natural selection (to spread their genes). So if biological evolution is a product of cosmological natural selection, it has a purpose in a defensible sense of that term —  and we’re part of that purpose. So add another item to our listicle: Myth number four: If evolution has a purpose, the purpose must have been imbued by an intelligent being.  That said, one interesting feature of current discourse is a growing openness among some scientifically minded people to the possibility that our world has a purpose that was imparted by an intelligent being. I’m referring to “simulation” scenarios, which hold that our seemingly tangible world is actually a kind of projection emanating from some sort of   powerful computer and the history of our universe, including evolution on this planet, is the unfolding of a computer algorithm whose author must be pretty bright. You may scoff, but in 2003 the philosopher Nick Bostrom of Oxford University published a paper laying out reasons to think that we are pretty likely to be living in a simulation. And the simulation hypothesis has gained influential supporters. Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium and America’s de facto astronomer laureate, finds it plausible. The visionary tech entrepreneur Elon Musk says there’s almost no chance that we’re living in “base reality. ” The New Yorker reported earlier this year that “two tech billionaires”  —   it didn’t say whether Musk is one of them  —   “have gone so far as to secretly engage scientists to work on breaking us out of the simulation. ” I’m guessing that will take awhile, and meanwhile I’d like to note an irony. When an argument for higher purpose is put this way  —   that is, when it doesn’t involve the phrase “higher purpose” and, further, is cast more as a technological scenario than a metaphysical one  —   it is considered intellectually respectable. I don’t mean there aren’t plenty of people who dismiss it. I’m talking about how people dismiss it. The Bostrom paper drew flack, but a lot of it was from people who thought the chances that we’re living in a simulation are way less than 50 percent, not from people who thought the idea was wholly crazy. If you walked up to the same people who gave Bostrom a respectful hearing and told them there is a transcendent God, many would dismiss the idea out of hand. Yet the simulation hypothesis is a God hypothesis: An intelligence of   power created our universe for reasons we can speculate about but can’t entirely fathom. And, assuming this intelligence still exists, it is in some sense outside of our reality  —   beyond the reach of our senses  —   and yet, presumably, it has the power to intervene in our world. Theology has entered “secular” discourse under another name. Personally, I’m fine with that. I think discussion of higher purpose should be respectable even in a scientific age. I don’t mean I buy the simulation scenario in particular, or the space alien scenario, or the cosmological natural selection scenario. But I do think there’s reason to suspect that there’s some point to this exercise we Earthlings are engaged in, some purpose imbued by something  —   and that, even if identifying that something is for now hopeless, there are grounds for speculating about what the point of the exercise is. I won’t elaborate much on this, since I’ve done that elsewhere, arguing that higher purpose can be framed as a hypothesis, and that evidence for or against the hypothesis can be marshaled. But I will say that the evidence I see for purpose includes not just the direction of biological evolution, but the direction of technological evolution and of the broader social and cultural evolution it drives  —   the evolution that has carried us from   bands to the brink of a cohesive global community. And if the purpose involves sustaining this direction  —   becoming a true global community  —   then it would seem to include moral progress. In particular, our purpose would involve transcending the psychology of tribalism that can otherwise divide people along ethnic, national, religious and ideological lines. Which would mean  —   in light of recent political and social developments in the United States and abroad  —   that our work is cut out for us."
295,17614,Should Ivanka Trump the Woman Wear Ivanka Trump the Brand? - The New York Times,New York Times,Vanessa Friedman,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,"A few hours after her father’s news conference on Wednesday at Trump Tower, Ivanka Trump posted a notice on her personal Facebook page officially announcing that she was taking a “formal leave of absence” from all management and operative responsibilities at her fashion brand and that she would be stepping down from her role at the Trump Organization. She would, she wrote, be spending the next few months concentrating on settling her children into their new lives in Washington and exploring how she could “determine the most impactful and appropriate ways for me to serve our country. ” This follows earlier decisions to separate her personal social media accounts from those of her brand. Yet in one meaningful area, Ms. Trump and her brand are harder to divide: That is, her wardrobe. After all, the same day she announced she was separating Ivanka Trump the person from Ivanka Trump the brand, The Daily Mail announced she had worn an Ivanka Trump coat to her father’s news conference. Then it offered a    box and link. In case, you know, anyone wanted to buy the garment. That turned out not to be true  —   according to a spokesman for Ms. Trump, the coat was by Joseph Altuzarra  —   but the confusion around woman and product made for some uncomfortable optics, and it raises the question: What does it mean to separate individual from company where fashion is concerned? On the one hand, there’s something ridiculous about suggesting that Ms. Trump not wear whatever clothes are in her closet, and as the founder of a fashion brand that bears her name, presumably part of her job has been to promote said brand by wearing it  —   to, in effect, demonstrate her belief in her own products. So she probably has a lot of such products within reach. And it’s not her fault if some media outlet chooses to point out that she looks good and tells people how they, too, can look good. On the other hand, her brand is clearly built on her image: Not just her name, but her face, and what she represents. It’s selling the promise that women who wear her clothes can get a piece of her gold dust  —   and now that this gold dust is visible in the corridors (and news conferences) of power, that is only going to be more true. Every time she is pictured in an Ivanka Trump outfit, it is bound to give a boost to the Ivanka Trump brand. Whether or not they are technically linked. It’s unclear whether Ms. Trump would benefit from that financially, as specifics about her monetary relationship with her brand were not included in her statement. But even if she is selling her part of the company, for a prominent member of the first family to be seen to be endorsing a brand with her own name on it is a complicated proposition. And an endorsement is exactly what an appearance in an item of clothing has become. This is a time, like it or not, of obsession with the wardrobe selections of anyone in the public eye, especially women in the public eye (their clothes are more interesting than men’s, after all). And though she has repeatedly said that she will not take a formal role in the new administration, Ms. Trump is emerging as the female face of her father’s inner circle. Simply consider the news conference, where she was the only woman from the immediate family in attendance. There’s a reason The Daily Mail did not get into the specifics of what her brothers wore. She is smart enough to know that any time she steps out of her door, someone is going to try to snap a picture and parse her clothes. You can argue that Ms. Trump is not an elected official, and thus to demand that she recuse herself from all products associated with her name is unfair punishment. You could say that if she wears, for example, an Alexander McQueen dress, as she did on election night, she is giving that brand a boost, so why shouldn’t she do the same for her own brand? You can point out that there is precedent because she wore her own line numerous times during the campaign, including to introduce her father at the Republican National Convention  —   but then, the latter choice was not without controversy. In part, the resulting brouhaha was, of course, because her brand then promoted that appearance with its own “get the look” link, as it famously did, without her knowledge, when she wore her   bracelet during her family’s appearance on “60 Minutes. ” Presumably that won’t happen any more. But brands need personalities to succeed, at whatever price point, and those personalities derive most easily from, well, a person. A scenario in which Ivanka Trump the brand removes Ms. Trump utterly from its identity is hard to imagine. Though to be fair, the brand’s website is adorned with images and line drawings of many different kinds of women and not with Ms. Trump, so it may be possible. Either way, this is another illustration of the multiple complicated issues that are going to arise with a member of the first family who also had designs on being a fashion brand. There’s really no playbook for this, as the Ivanka team  —   figuring it out as it goes along  —   is quick to remind. In which case, the clothes question should be the next piece of the puzzle to be solved."
990,18407,Downside of Being a Global Hub: Invasive Species - The New York Times,New York Times,Sarah Maslin Nir,2017-02-15,2017.0,2.0,,"Some are disarmingly named, like the cutesy Chinese mitten crab. Others have names more indicative of their undesirable nature, like rock snot, an algae that slimes up cool forest streams. They are some of more than 100 invasive species that conservationists must battle in New York State, which teems with a growing number of plants, birds, fish, insects, mosses, molds and fungi that actually belong somewhere else. With some of the busiest airports and ports in the United States, New York has far more invasive species of certain types than any other state, federal officials say. Carried inside airplane wheels or in the ballast water of large boats, many creatures and spores show up in New York first, making it a laboratory of sorts where scientists and others strive to devise methods to banish the outsiders or risk losing native flora and fauna to invading hordes. Underscoring the increasing menace posed by persistent pest species, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, recently announced a $2 million grant challenging groups and institutions to come up with fresh strategies to fight living things like   zebra mussels and a catastrophic fungus that causes even the most ancient oaks to wilt away. Last year, the state budget for invasive species control was nearly doubled from 2015, to $12 million. “New York State is a real epicenter for everything invasive, whether it’s aquatic, forest or terrestrial, because of where we sit in terms of international and interstate commerce,” said Robert Davies, director of the division lands and forests for the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation. “The world is getting smaller and one of the downsides of the world getting smaller is this. ” Invasive species have long been a threat unwanted visitors, once they arrive, sometimes stay forever. The Asian   beetle was first discovered in New York in 1996 and has been devouring hardwood trees nationwide ever since. In the last century, chestnut blight, a fungus, wiped out nearly all of New York’s American chestnuts, once the most populous tree in the state. And gypsy moths, introduced from France in the 1860s, are still here, decimating leafy trees. Despite strict rules about what can be brought into the United States and the screening of goods and packages by federal authorities at entry points, the sheer volume of traffic makes it virtually impossible to erect a foolproof barrier. “As a global hub for international trade and travel, New York is on the front lines of protecting our nation,’’ Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. The state mobilized in December after the discovery that oak trees in Brooklyn and in Suffolk County on Long Island were infected with oak wilt, a deadly fungus that chokes off trees’ internal water supply. There is no known cure contaminated trees must be cut down and their root systems killed to prevent the fungus from spreading. The state issued an order forbidding the transporting of oak wood out of the affected counties. In Brooklyn, the outbreak was detected in a northern red oak tree  —   just one so far  —   inside the   Cemetery, the final resting place for many luminaries. Now, only a stump is left of a   shade tree that was over 50 years old. It was cut down last month to prevent the wilt’s spread. The stump will get a coat of herbicide that will kill the root system, which is still infected. “The potential for the devastation here is immediately impactful, but it’s also the significance for the oaks throughout the city,” said Joseph Charap, the director of horticulture for the cemetery, who first noticed the diseased oak. He stood among the graves on a recent morning, while in the bare canopy of an uninfected oak tree above him, teams of   men tethered to the upper branches sawed off limbs. The discovery had set off a race to prune all 664 of the cemetery’s oak trees while they are dormant for the winter as a barricade against the spread of disease. The branches that are trimmed are treated with a special paint to guard against the fungus entering the trees. “The potential to lose our oak collection is unthinkable,” Mr. Charap said. Across the country, invasive species cause over $100 billion in damage every year, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, from blighted crops to boats covered with sharp zebra mussels. New York State does not keep a total for damage caused, but the annual bill just to control one species  —   the sea lamprey, a parasitic fish  —   is $500, 000. The overall budget for invasive species control is about $5. 5 million. While the state is at the epicenter of the problem, there are hot spots, including other parts of the East Coast, California and Texas. Sitting at the intersection of so many streams of commerce, New York has had to innovate under the pressures of invasive species. In 2009 it introduced a novel law forbidding the transporting of any firewood more than 50 miles from its source to prevent the spread of disease. (The oak at   Cemetery, Mr. Charap believes, was probably infected by firewood improperly brought to the city.) Inside a laboratory at Cornell University, tiny,   Galerucella birmanica beetles from China are kept under quarantine as their appetite for water chestnut is tested. An invasive aquatic species most likely introduced to New York in the 1880s, the water chestnut continues to clog the state’s fresh waterways. Someday, the bugs may be released as a biological means to control the plant. The state Conservation Department has also created an app that allows people to log sightings of plants and animals they suspect might not belong in their yards or any natural areas. Last year, over 300 people reported more than 12, 000 such sightings. On the ground, the battle is fought with teams of forestry experts going    inoculating root systems against fungus. In the air, the Conservation Department uses State Police helicopters to conduct seasonal patrols to spot shriveled trees on mountainsides or to search for animals that do not belong here, such as the Eurasian  boar. Such efforts do pay off. It’s been several years since the last boar sighting for Bill Burns, 75, a farmer who grows corn and other crops on over 600 acres in Spafford, N. Y. on the eastern edge of the Finger Lakes. Mr. Burns estimates that the animals, which are native to Russia and are believed to have been introduced here by game farmers who were careless with their fences, have caused more than $100, 000 in damages to his crops over the years. “They will go right down the corn planter tracks and suck the seed right out of the ground,” Mr. Burns said. He shot and killed several of them  —   “they taste rewarding,’’ he said  —   but it took a concerted effort by the state and federal authorities, which sent in specially trained trappers and dogs to round up the animals, to achieve true relief. The pigs have been eradicated from the state, according to the Conservation Department. Still, from his kitchen window, Mr. Burns can look across Skaneateles Lake and see stands of dead ash trees. He believes they have been killed by swarms of emerald ash borers, a   Asian beetle first confirmed to have colonized New York State in 2009, according to Cornell University. The insects are one of the state’s top priorities. Mr. Burns fears it is too late. “I am irritated and disappointed in just about everybody in the world that is careless,” he said."
1222,18665,"After Eight Years in Guantánamo, He Yearns to Return - The New York Times",New York Times,Carlotta Gall,2017-02-18,2017.0,2.0,,"TUNIS  —   Dressed in a thick jacket and wool hat on a cool winter evening, counting the coins for his bus fare, Hedi Hammami looks like any other Tunisian on his way to work. But he walks with a limp and sometimes pauses midspeech and screws up his face in pain. “That’s Guantánamo,” he explains. After eight years as a detainee in the United States detention facility in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, he says he still suffers from headaches, depression and anxiety attacks from the torture and other mistreatment he says he suffered there, even six years after his release. Married with two children now and employed as a nighttime ambulance driver, Mr. Hammami, 47, seems to have rebuilt his life. Yet the pressures of living in Tunisia’s faltering democracy, under harassment and enduring repeated raids by the police, have driven him to make an extreme request. “It would be better for me to go back to that single cell and to be left alone,” he said recently. “Two or three weeks ago I went to the Red Cross and asked them to connect me to the U. S. foreign ministry to ask to go back to Guantánamo. ” The Red Cross refused to take his request, he said, but he insists nevertheless that at this point, that would be best for him. “I have lost my hope,” he says. “There is no future in this country for me. ” When he was first released from Guantánamo in 2010, Tunisia was still a dictatorship under the rule of President Zine   Ben Ali and notorious for torturing prisoners, in particular Islamists. Deemed no longer a threat to the United States, Mr. Hammami was sent to the former Soviet republic of Georgia. After the popular uprising in 2011 that overthrew Mr. Ben Ali and set off the Arab Spring, Mr. Hammami negotiated his return to Tunisia. He timed it well, benefiting from a national amnesty for political prisoners and a program of compensation that gave him a job in the Ministry of Health. “I hoped very much that after the revolution everything would get better,” he said in one of several interviews in his rented home in a   suburb of Tunis. Yet, soon after he began work in 2013, the police raided his apartment with dogs at 3 a. m. breaking the door and hauling him down to the police station. “They made me crawl on all fours down the stairs,” he recounted. At the police station they said they just wanted to get to know him, and let him go after 15 minutes. “That was just the beginning. ” Since then, Mr. Hammami has lived under a constant regimen of police surveillance, raids and harassment. His cellphone and computer were confiscated. When he moved to a new house, the police followed him, turning up at all hours to question him. In December 2015 he was placed under house arrest, told he no longer had the right to work and ordered to sign in at the police station morning and evening for six weeks. He remains under “administrative control,” and the police enforce the order at will. He cannot travel outside Tunis. Every so often, like on Sept. 11, the police order him to sign in with them. “I feel someone is doing it for revenge,” he says. The police have also scared landlords from renting to him, forcing him to move six times in three years. His Algerian wife’s residency card was confiscated, preventing her from working to supplement his meager salary. The family is barely managing, she said, asking not to be named for fear of further police harassment. Stress and tension from the police actions have intensified the psychological problems Mr. Hammami brought with him from Guantánamo. “I feel too much pressure,” he said, rubbing his temples. “All that blackness comes back. ” Rim Ben Ismail, a psychologist working for the World Organization Against Torture in Tunisia, who has counseled 12 Tunisians who were detained in Guantánamo, says Mr. Hammadi’s wish to return to his cell is fairly typical of the Guantánamo detainees. “They lived with suffering, physical suffering,” she said in an interview. “But now there is a psychic suffering, and often they say, ‘Take me back there. ’” “Because of their past they are all presumed guilty and it is unlivable for all of them and their families,” she added. “The families are being threatened and harassed. ” Parents in particular fear the Tunisian security forces and say they think their sons would be safer in Guantánamo, she added. Raids have often been needlessly violent, she said police officials break down doors and wake a suspect with a gun to his head, often in front of his wife and children. “Everything is being done to create aggression in a person,” she said. “They do not need to raid the house at 2 a. m. ” One of her former Guantánamo patients was harassed so relentlessly by police that he became suicidal and ran off to Syria, where he was killed. “He was such a gentle person,” she said sadly. “By treating these people like this you create a climate of revenge and the sense that they have no place at home. ” There is no doubt that Tunisia has a terrorism problem. It has been grappling with attacks from Al   groups since 2013. The violence escalated to spectacular attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 70 people, many of them foreign tourists at a national museum and at a beach resort hotel. Moreover, Tunisians reportedly make up the largest number of foreign fighters to have joined the Islamic State and other extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, and some have been encouraged to conduct attacks when they return home. After an attack killed 12 members of the presidential guard in November 2015, the government imposed a state of emergency. At least 139 Tunisians have been placed under house arrest since, according to Human Rights Watch, which documented the cases in a report released in September. The sanctions have been justified in the context of countering terrorism but have “left people facing stigmatization and unable to pursue studies and work,” it stated. International human rights officials have voiced growing concerns of abuses resurfacing in Tunisia. In a report released this week, Amnesty International accused the Tunisian police and security forces of employing repressive measures used by past dictatorships, including torture, deaths in custody, arbitrary house raids and often unlawful harassment of suspects, their families and communities. Ben Emmerson, the United Nations special rapporteur for human rights while countering terrorism, said during a recent visit to Tunisia that human rights should be central to counterterrorism operations, noting that torture and other repressive measures fuel radicalism. Mr. Hammami says he feels the police are pushing him that way. The son of a farmer from Tunisia’s poor northwest, he says he originally left for Italy in 1986 in search of work. There he fell in with an Islamic missionary group, Tablighi Jamaat, and later traveled to Pakistan, where he obtained refugee status. He was arrested in Pakistan and handed over to the American military in 2002 and transferred to Guantánamo, where he was accused of training in Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. The Americans also say they found his identification papers in Tora Bora, the last redoubt of Osama bin Laden in the country, according to papers released by WikiLeaks. Mr. Hammami, who denies going to Afghanistan or having any links to Qaeda or terrorism, was eventually released without charge. Whatever his past, he says after nearly 20 years away, he just wants to live quietly. “I never committed a crime,” he said. “I don’t have a record, no theft, no ethics problems, nothing. ” “My only demand is to be stable, but they don’t let me live my life in stability,” he said. “They are pushing you towards death. ”"
1270,18717,Ex-Officer in Philippines Says He Led Death Squad at Duterte’s Behest - The New York Times,New York Times,Felipe Villamor,2017-02-21,2017.0,2.0,,"MANILA  —   A retired police officer racked with guilt over the murders of two of his own brothers has reversed himself and confessed to leading the Philippine death squad that killed them, saying that he was acting on the direct orders of Rodrigo Duterte before he became president. The former officer, Arthur Lascañas, said at a news conference on Monday that Mr. Duterte had sponsored the killings of drug and crime suspects while he was mayor of the southern city of Davao. Mr. Lascañas has now become the second professed hit man to level such accusations against Mr. Duterte. At least 3, 600 people, and possibly thousands more, have been killed by the police or vigilantes since Mr. Duterte became president in June. Rights groups have said that the police may have ordered the extrajudicial killings of drug dealers and users, a charge that officials have denied. Mr. Duterte’s spokesman, Martin Andanar, on Monday dismissed Mr. Lascañas’s allegations as “part of a protracted political drama” intended to undermine the president’s leadership. Mr. Lascañas, 56, said that he was the leader of the Davao Death Squad, a group that he said Mr. Duterte had formed to go after   drug dealers and petty criminals but that later evolved into a force to eliminate political opponents. He is the second person claiming membership in the squad to speak out against Mr. Duterte, bolstering the explosive testimony of another professed hit man, Edgar Matobato, who has been in hiding since last year, when he linked the president to the killings. On Monday, Mr. Lascañas broke down in tears and said Mr. Matobato’s accusations were true. “We started the salvaging of people when Mayor Duterte first sat down as mayor in Davao City,” he said. “The people we targeted are criminals and were into illegal drugs. We were implementing the personal orders of Duterte. ” “Salvaging” is a euphemism in the Philippines for summary executions. Mr. Lascañas said members of the squad were usually paid $400 to $1, 000 for the killings “depending on the status” of the target. “All the killings that we committed in Davao City, whether they were buried or thrown in the sea, were paid for by Mayor Duterte,” he said. Mr. Lascañas said that he received an allowance directly from Mr. Duterte’s office and that he had led the group for a long time. He said his earlier testimony, made before the Senate last year, was “all lies. ” He said that two of his brothers  —   whom he identified as Cecilio and Fernando  —   were among the group’s victims and that he had concealed the details surrounding their deaths from the family until Monday. “They were involved in illegal drugs,” Mr. Lascañas said. “Now my nephews know that I was instrumental to the murders. In my belief about the campaign, I had committed this. ” He also confirmed Mr. Matobato’s earlier statement linking Mr. Duterte to the murder of Jun Pala, a radio commentator critical of the former mayor and a known supporter of a vigilante group in Davao guarding against Communist guerrillas. Mr. Lascañas said he was paid about $60, 000 to get rid of him. “We planned and carried out the assassination of Jun Pala,” he said. After Mr. Pala survived an ambush, Mr. Lascañas said, he met with Mr. Duterte, who told him to take his time in killing the broadcaster. Mr. Pala was shot by gunmen near his home in 2003, in a killing that the police attributed to a Communist rebel hit squad. “This is the real truth in the Pala murder case,” Mr. Lascañas said. “I am one of those who murdered him. ” Mr. Lascañas also said that he and other members of the squad killed a kidnapping suspect, his pregnant wife, his    and two servants. He said the victims were seized and taken to a quarry, where they were gunned down. He did not say how the bodies were disposed of, but last year Mr. Matobato testified that victims were chopped up and then their parts taken to sea to be scattered. It was not immediately clear what Mr. Lascañas would do next, but he has been under the protection of the Free Legal Assistance Group, an organization of rights advocates and lawyers who have criticized Mr. Duterte’s deadly campaign against drugs. The group said that Mr. Lascañas had drawn up a sworn affidavit and was ready to testify before any government body, including the Senate. Mr. Lascañas’s statements on Monday were in line with Mr. Matobato’s testimony last year. At the time, he said he was one of the first civilians Mr. Lascañas had recruited into the death squad, originally known as the Lambada Boys, that was responsible for kidnappings, killings and the bombing of a mosque in Davao. He said the squad answered to Mr. Duterte and his longtime lieutenant, Ronald dela Rosa, now director general of the Philippine National Police. Mr. Andanar, the president’s spokesman, said in his statement on Monday: “Our people are aware that this character assassination is nothing but vicious politics orchestrated by sectors affected by the reforms initiated by the Duterte administration. ” “Bringing change is not an easy task,” he added. “The Duterte administration has disturbed, disrupted the establishment. However, we remain undistracted in delivering goods and services to serve the people, not just the interest of the few. ” Senator Antonio Trillanes, who has been feuding with Mr. Duterte and who supported Mr. Matobato when he made his accusations last year, said that Mr. Andanar’s statement was intended to divert attention away from “the issue of the president’s complicity” in multiple murders. Senator Risa Hontiveros called Mr. Lascañas’s allegations a “direct stab at the credibility” of the president that undermined his “moral capacity to lead. ” “They strengthen suspicions that the death squads responsible for thousands of unsolved extrajudicial killings are ” Ms. Hontiveros said. She called on the Senate to investigate Mr. Lascañas’s accusations and respond to what she called the “public’s clamor for truth and accountability. ”"
1327,18779,Trump Vowed to Protect the Safety Net. What if His Appointees Disagree? - The New York Times,New York Times,Yamiche Alcindor,2017-02-24,2017.0,2.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   Two days before Election Day, Donald J. Trump traveled to Sioux City, Iowa, and proclaimed that he was the protector of federal programs aimed at helping elderly and   Americans. It was Hillary Clinton, he said, who was an untrustworthy steward of the working class and who would slash vital benefits. “I am going to protect and save your Social Security and your Medicare,” Mr. Trump said. “You made a deal a long time ago, a long time ago. ” The pledge followed earlier promises to enact a new    benefit and not to make cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. When President Trump addresses Congress this Tuesday and follows the speech with a budget blueprint for the fiscal year that begins in October, his White House will finally address in concrete numbers one of his central contradictions: He campaigned as the populist protector of programs for the working class, yet he has pledged to control the budget deficit, cut spending and cut taxes. Moreover, Mr. Trump has surrounded himself with traditional   conservatives bent on cutting back or eliminating many of the programs he has championed. Many of his aides and cabinet members have expressed views that are fundamentally opposed to those he campaigned on. Former Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, for example, the new White House budget director, has called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme” and helped engineer a government shutdown to cut spending. As House Budget Committee chairman, Tom Price, the new secretary of health and human services, supported converting Medicaid to strictly capped block grants to the states and turning Medicare into a voucherlike program for future recipients. Ben Carson, the president’s nominee to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has repeatedly said government programs to help the poor lead to dependency. The disparity between Mr. Trump’s rhetoric and his appointments has cheered many Republicans and left Democrats fearing that he will not only renege on his promises to protect the government’s largest entitlement programs but that he will also slash programs he did not mention on the campaign trail that offer food, housing and child care support for the poor. “The appointments that he’s made are troublesome and very, very scary,” Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, said. “He made a pledge and sort of delineated himself from the rest of the Republican field by saying these things. Everything he’s done since he’s been elected is very worrisome. ” Already, Mr. Trump’s budget office has hinted at cuts to come in a memo that singled out the Legal Services Corporation, which helps the poor manage legal issues, and the Appalachian Regional Commission, which targets economic development in some of the poorest parts of the country. The memo also said that AmeriCorps, a program that puts volunteers into poor communities, would be zeroed out, and that the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, a nonprofit organization focused on urban development, would see its budget cut substantially. On Capitol Hill, some Republicans are hoping Mr. Mulvaney and others will change the president’s mind on far bigger targets and convince him that structural changes to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid  —   the biggest drivers of deficits that are projected to rise over the next decade  —   are needed to control the national debt and to preserve the programs without substantial tax increases. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid consumed nearly $1. 9 trillion of the government’s $3. 9 trillion in spending in 2016, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and with the number of people 65 and over projected to rise by a third over the next decade, Social Security and Medicare spending is projected to increase from a third of all spending in 2017 to 42 percent by 2027. Including Medicaid and military and federal civilian retirement benefits, federal spending on older adults will rise from 37 percent of outlays in 2017 to 45 percent in 2027 if nothing is done to change the programs. Even some liberal economists say that will amount to a transfer of funds from poor children and families toward   older Americans, because the budget office projects that discretionary spending  —   where most programs for poor families come from  —   will be squeezed from 6. 3 percent of the economy now to 5. 3 percent in 2027, the smallest level since 1962. With those numbers on their side, Republicans are most likely to use their power in both the executive and legislative branches to push through large cuts to federal programs for poor and   Americans, say Democrats and liberal policy analysts  —   if Mr. Trump eases up on his promises. “This is the greatest threat to   people in my lifetime,” said Olivia Golden, executive director of the Center for Law and Social Policy, a nonprofit organization focused on   Americans. House Republican allies see no real contradiction in Mr. Trump’s campaign promises and what they say he must now do. Since President George W. Bush’s failed 2005 effort to partially privatize Social Security, Republicans have assured retirees and those nearing retirement that any changes or cuts to entitlement programs for older adults would not affect them. Now, Republicans are retroactively applying those caveats to Mr. Trump’s promises, saying the president understands that programs like Social Security and Medicare must be maintained for Americans who are currently receiving benefits but must be changed for younger Americans who may have to work longer before retiring and getting benefits. “It was really about making sure that those people who are getting benefits or about to get benefits are protected,” said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and a leader of the   conservative House Freedom Caucus. “If we do nothing, he will not save Medicare and Social Security. ” Representative Jeff Duncan, Republican of South Carolina, said he would be closely watching his former Freedom Caucus colleague, Mr. Mulvaney, as he settles in to work at the Office of Management and Budget. “I’m curious to see how Mick Mulvaney approaches this from O. M. B. because he is very   with us here,” Mr. Duncan said. In fact, on the campaign trail and in interviews before the election, Mr. Trump did not suggest that he would maintain the programs in their current form only for older Americans. His rallies were attended by a   of ages, who cheered his broad promises. And last March, Mr. Trump said during a debate among Republican presidential candidates that he planned to make no changes. “I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is,” Mr. Trump said. “I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. ” The pressure to break that promise will come not only from congressional Republicans but also from his own campaign pledges to build a wall along the Mexican border, increase spending on defense, border security and infrastructure, cut taxes “big league” and control the deficit. “The last time we saw this kind of budgetary logic was at the beginning of the Reagan administration when he came into office, pledged to beef up defense spending and cut taxes,” said William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former aide to President Bill Clinton. “They tried to keep the spending increases down and the deficit increases down by whacking away at social safety net programs, many of which were cut during that period. ” Even if Mr. Trump keeps his promise not to touch Social Security and Medicare, other programs like housing subsidies, child care assistance, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, could be cut, social welfare and budget analysts say. And those cuts would not just affect poor minority voters, who tend to support Democratic candidates. A study released this month by the   Center on Budget and Policy Priorities research group shows that white   adults without a college degree, a critical voting block for Republicans, benefit the most from social safety net programs and   benefits. “My fear is that we are going to see the biggest cuts that any president has ever proposed in programs for   and   families,” said Bob Greenstein, the center’s president. “It could be the biggest Robin Hood in reverse a president has ever offered. ”"
1546,19020,Trump Expected to Issue New Travel Ban Excluding Iraq on Monday - The New York Times,New York Times,Ron Nixon and Maggie Haberman,2017-03-06,2017.0,3.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump is expected to issue on Monday a new version of his executive order on immigration that excludes Iraq, a key ally in the fight against the Islamic State, from a list of predominantly Muslim countries whose citizens will face temporary restrictions on travel to the United States. The new order would temporarily stop all refugee admissions to the United States, said a senior administration official familiar with it. The previous version included a   ban on all refugees other than Syrians, who were barred indefinitely. The new order removes the extra restrictions on Syrian refugees. It is unclear how long the temporary ban would last. The earlier order has been blocked by the courts the change on refugees is intended to help the new version withstand legal scrutiny. The new order would not affect people with green cards or those holding a valid visa at the time the order is signed. While some provisions in the new order have been relaxed, Mr. Trump and immigration   in the administration are expected to assert that the new version is no less strict because it retains a temporary ban on refugees. The senior administration official said Iraq had been removed from the travel ban after Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson had discussions with the Iraqi government about its vetting processes. The Iraqi officials insisted that their vetting system was thorough enough on its own. Some American officials had expressed concern that the restrictions would have affected Iraqis who had worked with the American military as interpreters or in other roles and sought to come to the United States. The official said the executive order is expected to be signed on Monday. David Lapan, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, referred all questions about the new executive order to the White House. Mr. Trump’s previous order  —   which temporarily barred visitors from Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Libya and Yemen  —   set off chaos and confusion at airports around the world. The new order retains a temporary travel ban on the six countries other than Iraq. After the first order was issued in January, passengers, many of them with green cards that allow them to live and work in the United States, were barred from flights into the country. Other people with visas were suddenly unsure if they would be allowed into the United States, and many of those who managed to arrive were stopped at airports. While the new restrictions are intended to withstand legal scrutiny, they are likely to set off similar court challenges. The previous executive order was criticized by several former   diplomatic and security officials, who said there was no national security purpose for the travel ban. Trump administration officials, including John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, defended the previous restrictions, saying they were needed because the countries listed did not have vetting systems in place that could guarantee that immigrants and other travelers from those nations did not pose a threat to the United States. “I believe that the travel pause from all of those countries will give us time to evaluate those countries and the information they can provide us, which will ultimately lead to safety for the American people,” Mr. Kelly told a Senate committee last month. But an intelligence assessment from Mr. Kelly’s own department said there was little evidence that those travelers posed an unusual threat. The   report found that “country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity. ” The assessment, first reported by The Associated Press, found that only a small number of people from the seven countries had been involved in   activities in the United States since the Syrian civil war began in 2011. The report also found that in the past six years, the terrorism threat had reached much more widely than the seven countries listed: People from 26 countries had been “inspired” to carry out attacks in the United States, it said. The new order is the first of several security measures planned for America’s borders. Mr. Trump has ordered the Department of Homeland Security to hire an additional 5, 000 Border Patrol agents, and Customs and Border Protection has begun accepting design proposals for a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Kelly said the administration was considering requiring foreign visitors to provide lists of the websites they have visited. This would enable intelligence officials “to get on those websites to see what they’re looking at,” he told senators last month. The United States also made changes to the visa waiver program in 2016 that made it harder for travelers to enter the United States from Europe if they had dual citizenship from Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria, or had visited one of those countries, or Libya, Somalia or Yemen, since 2011."
2337,19892,Jeff Bezos Says He Is Selling $1 Billion a Year in Amazon Stock to Finance Race to Space - The New York Times,New York Times,Nicholas St. Fleur,2017-04-07,2017.0,4.0,,"COLORADO SPRINGS  —   Standing against the backdrop of his New Shepard rocket booster and a   mock capsule for carrying humans into space, Jeff Bezos revealed on Wednesday that he was selling about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to finance his Blue Origin rocket company. Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, showed off the reusable rocket booster and the   of the capsule that will take people up for panoramic views back down at earth, during a symposium here. Mr. Bezos, who hopes to build Blue Origin into a commercial and tourist venture, also disclosed that it would cost about $2. 5 billion to develop an even bigger rocket, New Glenn, capable of lifting satellites and, eventually, people into orbit. Like his fellow technology titan Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla, Mr. Bezos has identified reusable rocket parts as a key to lowering the price of admission to the field, which he said on Wednesday would lead to a “golden age of space exploration. ” “If we can make access to space   then entrepreneurs will be unleashed,” he said. “You will see creativity, you will see dynamism, you will see the same thing in space that I’ve witnessed on the internet in the last 20 years. ” Last month, Mr. Bezos announced the   customer, Eutelstat, a satellite company, for New Glenn, whose commercial flights would help offset costs. New Glenn is expected to fly by 2020, he said, but humans will not be passengers on the   rocket until many years after that. Mr. Bezos has repeatedly expressed caution about setting timetables for the start of Blue Origin’s commercial or passenger trips, and he did not diverge from that on Wednesday. He would not say when New Shepard would undergo its next round of test flights, or set a specific date as a goal, merely mentioning next year for possible tourist trips. “It’s a mistake to race to a deadline when you’re talking about a flying vehicle, especially one that you’re going to put people on,” he said. “I still think we can do commercial paying passengers in 2018. ” Asked how much passengers would pay, Mr. Bezos said he did not know yet, but he predicted ticket prices would decline as spaceflight became more common. (Hundreds of people have already put down deposits to reserve places on similar commercial trips on Virgin Galactic that could cost $250, 000 a ticket, although that company’s spaceplane has yet to take anyone up.) New Shepard is a modest start for Mr. Bezos’s ambitions to tap into the nascent space tourism market. It is a   booster with a capsule on top that is designed to carry six passengers at a time on trips of about 10 to 11 minutes. There will not be a Blue Origin crew on the spacecraft. Passengers wearing sleek jumpsuits will be able to peer out what the company says will be the largest windows in space, taking up about   of the surface area of the dome. About 12 feet in diameter, the passenger capsule holds six black seats that resemble recliners, with panels offering details about altitude and other features of a trip. The engine that powers the booster produces up to about 110, 000 pounds of thrust. On ascent, passengers will experience forces of about 3 Gs, about three times the normal force of gravity that humans experience on earth. When the booster reaches a certain altitude, the capsule will detach and coast above the Karman line, which is 62 miles above sea level, officially entering into space. There, the passengers will experience about four to five minutes of weightlessness. They can unbuckle their harnesses and do somersaults, if desired, in the   interior. On descent, they will encounter forces of 5 Gs. The capsule will parachute back to the plains of West Texas, slowing to a coasting speed of about 20 miles per hour, while the booster drops and fires its engine to slow down and make a vertical landing. The capsule slows to 3 m. p. h. before touching down. Both pieces are reusable to make the trips more economical. “Reusability is the key to getting millions of people living and working in space,” Mr. Bezos said. While the concept is similar to the procedures SpaceX has used to recover the boosters for its Falcon 9 rockets, SpaceX’s endeavors have been far more challenging, because the boosters must accelerate to speeds of thousands of miles per hour in order to put payloads on a trajectory to reach orbit. Just last week, SpaceX successfully launched a satellite into space with a reused booster, a first for commercial spaceflight. New Shepard has a simpler flight path: just up and down, almost like a big roller coaster that slows to a stop at the top of its arc. However, Mr. Bezos and his Blue Origin team believe that New Shepard, which is expected to fly many times, will give the company ample practice and experience that can be applied to New Glenn, which will be manufactured and launched in Florida. The New Shepard booster on display at the Colorado symposium made five successful    flights beginning in November 2015. Its last flight, in October, included a test of an   system that is designed to blast the capsule  —   and, eventually, passengers  —   to safety in case something goes wrong with the booster. The abort system worked. To the pleasant surprise of the engineers, the booster survived the force of separation, righted itself and descended to a landing. (It would have still been considered a successful test if the booster had crashed.) A Virgin Galactic test flight in 2014 crashed, killing one pilot and severely injuring the other. Both Mr. Bezos and Mr. Musk have much more ambitious goals beyond their current rockets. Mr. Musk wants to send settlers to Mars. Mr. Bezos has said his   vision involves having millions of people living and working in space."
2426,19993,The Ghost at the Bar - The New York Times,New York Times,Rosie Schaap,2017-04-07,2017.0,4.0,,"Many Tuesday afternoons, as I stand behind the bar where I work, my focus fixes on a Manchester United scarf draped on the far wall, near the door to the patio. When that happens, I think of Mark, one of my first regulars at this place. He drank beer and bourbon. He was kind. He adored his family and thrilled to watch Man U play. When he died suddenly and unexpectedly, our bar community grieved. The scarf is there to remember him by. I still feel his warm spirit filling that corner, like a friendly ghost, pint in hand. Stick around any bar long enough  —   on the working side or the civilian side  —   and you will inevitably come to love at least some of the people who drink there. Stick around longer, and you will just as inevitably lose some of those people you love. I’ve long cherished bars as sites of real community, where nearly the whole of an adult’s life cycle can be enacted and observed. I’ve watched customers and fellow regulars fall in love and get married. I’ve celebrated the births of their children (after that, they usually become much less regular). I’ve seen them get old, get sick and belly up to the bar for their last round at their final last call. It feels right to strike an elegiac tone for my last Drink column. In 2011, I began with a few martini recipes and some advocacy on behalf of vermouth. I can’t count the number of cocktails I’ve made and tasted in the name of “research” for this column, but I still prefer the simplest stuff. In offering a Gibson  —   essentially a martini in which the customary olive is replaced by a pickled onion  —   I’m returning to where I started. If you like your martinis with olives, you’ve probably noticed that the quality of the olive can make a big difference. So it is with the garnish in a Gibson: The better the onion, the better the cocktail. I like to pickle my own, for optimal flavor. The recipe here, adapted from Gabriella Mlynarczyk, gracefully balances salt, spice and sweetness. Maybe the onion is far too obvious a metaphor, considering its association with tears, but I’ve never been great with goodbyes. Over these last    years, I’ve maintained that the places where, the times when, the reasons and  —   most of all  —   the people with whom we drink, are what make drinking matter. The most beautifully made cocktail is of no consequence to me without good company: It may be a delicious thing, but it’s only a thing. Recipe: The Gibson | Pickled Cocktail Onions"
2876,20478,Justice or ‘Conspiracy’? Terrorism Trial Divides Somalis in Minneapolis - The New York Times,New York Times,Jack Healy and Matt Furber,2016-06-06,2016.0,6.0,,"MINNEAPOLIS  —   The day after his oldest son was convicted of conspiring to join and kill for the Islamic State in Syria, Abdihamid Yusuf just wanted to go home and rest. But bills were stacking up, so on Saturday morning he and his wife visited the jail and then reopened Hooyo’s Kitchen, the small Somali restaurant where they serve plates of chicken, rice and bananas. “We try to survive,” Mr. Yusuf said. The trial of his son and two other young   men splintered families and opinions here in the country’s largest Somali community. Former friends testified against one another, describing how they had watched propaganda videos, bought fake passports and plotted their paths to Syria. Family members squabbled in the halls of the courthouse. Some said they had been threatened or shunned. When the jury came back on Friday afternoon, Mr. Yusuf did not even get word in time to reach the courtroom to see his    son, Mohamed Farah, and the two other defendants, Guled Omar, 21, and Abdirahman Daud, 22, declared guilty. A total of nine men  —   including another of Mr. Yusuf’s sons, Adnan  —   have been convicted in the case. Federal prosecutors say the case shined a light on the persistent problem of terrorist recruiting here. Law enforcement authorities have said that more than 20 young men from Minnesota have left to join the Shabab militant group in Somalia and that more than 15 have tried or succeeded in leaving to join the Islamic State. But it also opened wounds among families, and at the end of the trial, some in the community praised justice served, while others pointed to what they called another injustice. Deqa Hussen said she had learned the price of cooperating: “They’ve been calling me snitch. ” Her oldest son, Abdirizak Warsame, 21, briefly acted as the leader of a group of friends as they planned to travel to Syria in 2014. He pleaded guilty and testified for prosecutors, telling the jury how he had wanted the rewards of martyrdom. Now, Ms. Hussen said, longtime friends and strangers have accused her of selling her son to the government. During the trial, she said, the mother of another defendant threatened her life. “I have to respect the government and I have to respect my son,” she said. “My culture is a culture of silence. You cannot speak your rights. ” Some in the Somali community praised the government. They said that the three defendants had gotten a fair trial, and that they hoped the convictions would prompt candid talks about extremism and its allure to some young men here. “This is good for the community,” said Mohamed Ahmed, a gas station manager who created an online cartoon character, Average Mohamed, to condemn extremism. “It unmasks the fear, forces us to think deeply. We can either confront it or bury our heads. ” Jibril Afyare, an IBM software engineer and community activist, spoke of vigilance. He said he talked regularly to the United States attorney about the threat of recruitment by terrorist groups, and has a local police captain’s number on speed dial. “We cannot afford even one Somali youth to be recruited by extremists,” he said. “It’s dangerous for the country, and it’s dangerous for the Somali community. ” But others called the case a setup, and said the defendants had been goaded to act and praise terrorism by a onetime friend who made secret audio recordings as a paid federal informant. In barber shops and cafes where the case flashed on television screens, young men and old said the trial would harden the community’s relationship with law enforcement, and said the defendants did not deserve potential sentences of life in prison. “People think the trial was dishonest and was done in a hurry, that this is a conspiracy,” said Jamaal K. Farah, 35, a barber and comedian who goes by the name Happy Khalif and has attracted hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. Mr. Farah said he used to give haircuts to some of the nine friends who have now pleaded guilty or been convicted. He rejected portrayals of them as eager,   militants who spoke of wanting to spit on the United States, kill Turkish security forces or die as martyrs. The case focused on conversations and events in 2014 and 2015. Prosecutors said some of the defendants had watched Islamic State propaganda videos, met to discuss routes and timing to leave for Syria, tried to buy fake passports from an undercover F. B. I. agent and played paintball to train for combat. But to Mr. Farah and others skeptical of the convictions, the men were not defendants or terrorists, but boys, brothers, kids who had messed up but deserved a second chance. “These kids used to be part of this community,” Mr. Farah said. “This country gave us hope and a better life. We think this trial was a total injustice. ” As he watched boys play basketball outside a community center in central Minneapolis, Burhan Mohumed thought of his friend Guled Omar. He said Mr. Omar had played here before “he was caught up in that storm. ” Mr. Mohumed attended the trial regularly but was barred from the courthouse after he intervened in a fight and argued with court security officers. After the trial, Andrew M. Luger, the United States attorney for Minnesota, condemned the threats and courthouse scuffles as intolerable and “ . ” Mr. Mohumed supported the three defendants and, echoing others here, he was upset they could face life in prison even though they never left for Syria and never pulled a trigger. “If they can convict them on words and thoughts, it’s over,” he said. “People will not feel safe in our communities. ” But prosecutors said the case involved far more than thoughts. They said the defendants were ready to kill for the Islamic State and had made   efforts to fly out of Kennedy International Airport or cross the Mexican border to travel to Syria. On Saturday, Mr. Yusuf said, his wife insisted that they go back to work after they visited their son in jail. He said he had taken time off from his job driving a school bus to deal with the criminal cases against his sons. But they still had five other children to care for. So they opened Hooyo’s Kitchen, in a Somali shopping center stuffed with rug stores, barber shops, classrooms and kitchens, four floors above Mr. Farah’s barber shop. As his wife cooked, Mr. Yusuf rushed food to customers. People stopped by to tell them to be strong. Mr. Yusuf’s thoughts tilted back to his sons. He said Mohamed Farah, the oldest, was hopeful about sentencing, and had told him that whatever came next was God’s will. He worried about the cost of funding two commissary accounts so his sons could call him from jail. He worried about the distance he would have to drive to visit them. “It’s not fair,” Mr. Yusuf said. But he said they were propped up by faith. “We believe God will give, no matter what. ”"
4346,22107,2 Face Hate Crime Charges in Attack on Sikh Man in California - The New York Times,New York Times,Christopher Mele,2016-10-15,2016.0,10.0,,"Two men in California were charged with hate crimes on Friday in connection with an attack on a Sikh man, punching him in the face and using a knife to cut up to 10 inches of his hair, which was unshorn by religious mandate, a prosecutor said. The attack, which unfolded over the span of about three minutes and a   stretch of road in Richmond, Calif. on Sept. 25, started by chance, officials said. Five men who were doing subcontracting work at a refinery were staying at a local hotel and had been drinking beer most of the day when they went to get something to eat, Simon O’Connell, a deputy district attorney with the Contra Costa District Attorney’s Office, said in an interview on Friday. The men were in a pickup around 8:45 p. m. when they pulled up to a red traffic light next to a sedan driven by Maan S. Khalsa, 41, of Richmond. In what Mr. O’Connell said was an unprovoked act, the occupants threw beer cans at Mr. Khalsa’s car. When he rolled down his window and said, “You guys forgot something,” the men, angered by his remark, followed him to the next red light. Two of the men  —   identified as Chase B. Little, 31, of Beaumont, Tex. and Colton T. Leblanc, 24, of Winnie, Tex.  —   ran to Mr. Khalsa’s car and repeatedly punched him in the face through the open driver’s window, officials said. A turban Mr. Khalsa was wearing as part of his Sikh religion was disturbed in the attack, during which the men forced his head down and cut up to 10 inches of his hair with a knife, prosecutors said. “The savage cutting of Mr. Khalsa’s unshorn hair, a sacred article of his faith, constitutes a hate crime under the law,” the prosecutor’s office said in a news release. Mr. Little, who was taken into custody at the scene, was charged with assault and released that night on bail. He is to appear in court on Nov. 21. A warrant for Mr. Leblanc, who left the scene, has been issued, officials said. The other occupants of the pickup were not charged. Mr. Little and Mr. Leblanc were both charged with assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury and assault with a deadly weapon, with the “special allegation” that they were committed as hate crimes. With that enhancement, they could face a maximum of 11 years in prison, Mr. O’Connell said. It was not clear if Mr. Little had a lawyer, and neither man could be reached to comment on Friday. In a statement released through the Sikh Coalition, Mr. Khalsa said he was “violently targeted” because of his faith. “The charges are the first step to addressing violence and bigotry, which plague communities across the United States,” he said. Mr. Khalsa, an information technology specialist, had a black eye, numerous damaged teeth and several knife wounds to his left hand. His little finger will be amputated at the first knuckle because of an infection from the knife wound, officials said."
4797,22609,John Legend: Love Songs That Bow to Dark Shadows - The New York Times,New York Times,Jon Pareles,2016-12-01,2016.0,12.0,,"A little darkness serves John Legend well. Without it, the love songs that regularly place him in the Top 10  —   megahits like “All of Me” from 2013  —   are anodyne enough to work as wedding songs they’re a worthy and lucrative enterprise that can leave an unctuous, saccharine aftertaste. But “Darkness and Light,” his fifth studio album, treats love as something far more complex than a panacea and a fount of perpetual reassurance, with music to match. In his new songs, love can be a counterattack on mortality, a dangerous compulsion, a realm of sweaty adventures, a legacy from father to daughter, an escape from social media and a bulwark against forces of divisiveness. With a producer and   from outside the usual precincts of pop and    —   the guitarist Blake Mills, who has worked with Alabama Shakes and Fiona Apple  —   Mr. Legend’s music turns less glossy: earthier and often spookier. Drum tones are often woody and hollow keyboards and strings open up hazy spaces, sometimes without a beat. Among the songwriters, along with   names like Julia Michaels and John Ryan, is Will Oldham, who’s also known as the   Bonnie Prince Billy. “Love Me Now,” already a hit, is a    song with an overt sense of doom about the relationship: “I know it’ll kill me when it’s over. ” Its track revolves around an insistent,   piano figure, and its chorus first arrives with Mr. Legend nearly alone, singing over simple, fading chords: pop with all of its misgivings built in. The album begins with a manifesto: “I Know Better,” a gospelly hymn that has Mr. Legend declaring, “Some folks do what they’re   baby, this time I won’t” and adding, “My history has brought me to this  ’s power in the color of my face. ” It’s a connection to the socially conscious side Mr. Legend showed on “Wake Up! ,” his 2010 album with the Roots, and in “Glory,” his   song for “Selma” with the rapper Common. So is the song that closes the album, “Marching Into the Dark,” which moves from   gospel roots into surreal modern production and ponders individual sacrifice and the course of history. But for the rest of the album, Mr. Legend quickly pivots back to love and pleasure with the rhetorically awkward yet undeniably catchy “Penthouse Floor,” which has a touch of Stevie Wonder in its dance beat. It starts out with allusions to Black Lives Matter and taking pride in upward mobility but ends up, after an appearance by Chance the Rapper, with the singer settling into hedonism, enjoying “my favorite mix, a little ignorance and   the penthouse, baby. ” Through most of the album, romance has as much to do with conflict and obsession as with comfort. “Right by You (for Luna)” is addressed to Mr. Legend’s daughter it’s a ballad, not a lullaby, posing unanswered questions and veering into dissonance. In “What You Do to Me,” anger seesaws with lust  —   “Make me love and hate you at the same time”  —   pitting a low synthesizer against a stomping beat. “Same Old Story,” with wavering, unstable keyboard chords and eerie sustained strings, is a tender accusation: “Promising we’ll stay   in your heart, you know better. ” In “Overload,” a   duet with Miguel that wanders between guitar chords and   jazz, there’s a collision of love, fame and social media that leaves Mr. Legend wondering, “Must we make a spectacle of love?” Even when Mr. Legend plays his old, smoother self, making a pickup in a club in “Temporarily Painless,” there’s a hint of doubt and defensiveness. The title track, “Darkness and Light,” is a duet with Brittany Howard of Alabama Shakes, the perfect choice for a song that reclaims an old, slow soul back beat and revels in dynamics, with slinky verses that give way to an explosive chorus. His falsetto and her belting push themselves into the same space sometimes they trade verses, sometimes they split single lines. It makes desire a force of nature, ungovernable and irresistible and anything but simple."
5494,23428,Federal Judge Blocks Indiana Abortion Law - The New York Times,New York Times,Mitch Smith and Erik Eckholm,2016-07-01,2016.0,7.0,,"A federal judge on Thursday blocked an Indiana law that would have banned abortions based solely on a fetus’s disability or genetic anomaly, suggesting that it was an illegal limit on a woman’s   constitutional right. Judge Tanya Walton Pratt, of Federal District Court for Southern Indiana, also held up a state ban on abortions motivated solely by a fetus’s race or sex. In the preliminary injunction, Judge Pratt said limiting the reasons for an abortion was “inconsistent with the notion of a right rooted in privacy concerns and a liberty right to make independent decisions. ” While Judge Pratt’s injunction stops the law from taking immediate effect, and though she said the state would be unlikely to prevail at trial, the state can still defend the legislation. In a statement, the Indiana attorney general’s office said state lawyers would consider how to proceed and whether to appeal the injunction. Indiana would have been the first state to have a blanket ban on abortions based solely on race, sex or suspected disabilities, including evidence of Down syndrome. A handful of states have bans on abortion based on sex, one state has a ban based on race, and two have bans based on genetic anomalies, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit abortion rights group that tracks state laws. Judge Pratt’s decision, the first in a federal court to indicate that a ban on abortion because of genetic anomalies would likely be unconstitutional, is the latest setback for   groups. It comes days after a landmark Supreme Court ruling in a Texas case that two other kinds of restrictions  —   requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at local hospitals and imposing stringent   standards on abortion clinics  —   are unconstitutional. The Texas measures would have forced many clinics to shut down. In language that is expected to echo nationally, the Supreme Court held in its Monday ruling that the benefits of any such restrictions must be closely scrutinized and weighed against the burdens on women’s access to abortion. Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement that “momentum from Monday’s landmark decision” was aiding in challenges to abortion restrictions in Indiana and elsewhere. “These unconstitutional laws punish women, and we will bring them down, law by law and state by state,” Ms. Richards said. “We have been fighting these restrictions on all fronts for years, organizing in the field, building for this moment  —   and now the wind is at our backs. ” Kara Brooks, a spokeswoman for Gov. Mike Pence, said in a statement on Thursday that the governor was “disappointed” in the ruling and “remains steadfast in his support for the unborn, especially those with disabilities. ” Judge Pratt’s decision was also criticized in a statement by Indiana Right to Life, which noted that the jurist had been nominated by President Obama. That group’s chief executive, Mike Fichter, said the ruling “denied the civil rights of unborn children” and was “an appalling human rights injustice. ” Thursday’s case in Indiana was argued long before the new Supreme Court decision, and Judge Pratt’s opinion made no reference to it. Her ruling rested largely on the argument that the state, as established in a series of cases starting with Roe v. Wade in 1973, cannot impede a woman’s right to decide to have an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb, usually at around 24 weeks. Judge Pratt said “irreparable harm” would have occurred had that part of the law taken effect as scheduled on Friday. “Difficult moral and complicated health decisions are made by women whose pregnancies are affected by a prenatal fetal anomaly,” Judge Pratt wrote in her ruling. “Given the relatively short time frame in which women may elect to terminate a pregnancy, even a short disruption of a woman’s ability to do so could have significant consequences. ” Indiana’s law, signed in March by Mr. Pence, was framed by abortion foes and legislative Republicans as a way to prevent discrimination in abortions, in particular the fetuses with Down syndrome. Mr. Pence, a Republican, said that he signed the law “with a prayer that God would continue to bless these precious children, mothers and families. ” But the local chapters of Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the measure, claiming the law posed an undue burden to women and restricted freedom of speech, and asking Judge Pratt for the preliminary injunction she issued on Thursday. That injunction also sets aside a portion of the law that imposed new restrictions for disposing of fetal remains. Indiana’s law was exceptional for its breadth, but the restrictions it included were not unprecedented. Such legislation has become more common and has gained traction in many   statehouses. Dawn Johnsen, an Indiana University law professor who has pushed for abortion rights, said Thursday’s injunction was an important step toward invalidating such legislation. “It’s very strong reaffirmation of the constitutional right as the Supreme Court has interpreted it, but applied to new, creative, harmful restrictions,” Ms. Johnsen said. The Indiana measure had been controversial from the start, and Mr. Pence waited until his deadline before signing it into law. In the weeks that followed, abortion rights supporters rallied outside the Capitol against the law and started an online “Periods for Pence” campaign that encouraged women to tell the governor about their reproductive health."

5725,23751,Early Voting Limits Donald Trump’s Time to Turn Campaign Around - The New York Times,New York Times,Patrick Healy,2016-08-22,2016.0,8.0,,"Advisers to Donald J. Trump keep reassuring Republicans that there is still plenty of time to rescue his candidacy  —   nearly three months to counter Hillary Clinton’s vast operation in swing states and get Mr. Trump on message. The Trump team had better check the calendar. Voting actually starts in less than six weeks, on Sept. 23 in Minnesota and South Dakota, the first of some 35 states and the District of Columbia that allow people to cast ballots at polling sites or by mail before Nov. 8. Iowa is expected to have ballots ready by the end of September, as are Illinois and two other states. The electoral battlegrounds of Arizona and Ohio are to begin voting on Oct. 12, nearly four weeks before Election Day. And North Carolina and Florida will be underway before Halloween. Early voting has become a critical, even decisive factor in presidential elections: President Obama was sufficiently ahead in the early vote in Iowa and Nevada in 2012 that his campaign shifted resources from those states to others, according to former advisers, who also credited enthusiastic early voting in 2008 for his victory in North Carolina and elsewhere. Nearly 32 percent of voters cast their ballots before Election Day in 2012, according to census data, compared with 29. 7 percent in 2008 and 20 percent in 2004. With Mrs. Clinton spending aggressively to try to dominate the early vote, Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly created distractions for himself in the past two weeks, is in jeopardy not just of being outmaneuvered but also of running out of chances to improve perceptions of him enough to win over undecided voters. “When you have something as catastrophic as the Trump campaign is becoming, there aren’t enough weeks left to turn things around, and little ability to organize effectively and capture a strong share of the early vote,” said Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican strategist who worked on behalf of Jeb Bush during the primaries. If Mrs. Clinton swamps Mr. Trump in the early vote in some swing states, she can move staff and money to the most competitive places  —   like Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, judging from recent polls  —   while he scrambles to battle on multiple fronts. “As many as 40 percent of voters cast ballots in the early states, and you can’t organize overnight, or even in just a few weeks, and win them,” said Neil Newhouse, who was Mitt Romney’s pollster in 2012. “Truthfully, if the Clinton campaign inherited what the Obama campaign put together, they’ve got to have a head start in this over the Trump campaign. ” Indeed, Mrs. Clinton’s team, which includes a number of former top Obama campaign lieutenants, has been working with county officials to ensure that voters in swing states have places to cast their ballots early, organizing voters at the neighborhood level, and contacting those who may not know that they must request absentee ballots in jurisdictions that do not automatically send them. Some Clinton allies are also organizing “souls to the polls” buses that take church members to vote immediately after Sunday church services in Democratic strongholds like Cleveland. Early voters tend to be older and more partisan, and many choose to cast absentee ballots by mail, while others prefer to go to polling sites during special evening and weekend hours. In Arizona, many vote early rather than stand in long lines in the heat on Election Day. Early voting rules and times vary widely by state, and some   legislatures have sought to put new limits on options like Sunday and evening voting  —   attempts that have been struck down in several court rulings. The Clinton campaign has “voter protection teams” of lawyers pushing for as much early voting as possible. “In every state, our goal is to use all available tools so more voters have their voices heard in this election  —   whether that’s by mail, early vote, absentee, or on Election Day,” said Marlon Marshall, the Clinton campaign’s director of state campaigns and engagement. “We’ve been working for months to reach out to voters to make casting their ballot as easy and accessible as possible. ” Mr. Trump is lagging far behind. Unlike Mrs. Clinton, he has not been running television ads, which are crucial for engaging early voters, and he has state organizers of varying experience levels and scattershot ground troops in most places. His campaign is leaning on the Republican National Committee to open state offices to help with early voting. Both Mr. Romney and the 2008 Republican nominee, Senator John McCain, had more aggressive operations at this point. Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, said he did not think early voting would put Mr. Trump at a disadvantage, expressing confidence that the campaign’s ground operation would be well organized and executed and that Mr. Trump would ultimately attract enough undecided voters to win. Mr. Manafort said the presidential debates would be critical for Mr. Trump in the past, strong debate performances have led to a surge in early voting for the perceived winner, a boost that Mr. Romney enjoyed after he was widely seen as beating Mr. Obama in their first debate. “We are organizing for this,” Mr. Manafort said about early voting. “We have very experienced people involved. ” He declined to provide details. He spoke before the news broke early Wednesday that Mr. Trump was shaking up his campaign by adding two top staff members and effectively demoting Mr. Manafort, although he will keep his title. After Mr. Romney’s performance in that first 2012 debate, Republicans turned out in droves to vote or cast absentee ballots Mr. Obama recovered in the next debate, and his ground forces mobilized so strongly in some places that he was able to cut back on campaigning in some key states. He visited Des Moines on the eve of the election “for nostalgia, not need,” said David Plouffe, a longtime Obama adviser. “If you have an accurate model of how you are performing in early vote, you have an exact picture of where the race stands,” Mr. Plouffe said. In 2012, he added, the early vote trends in Iowa and Nevada meant “we could spend more time and money in Florida, most importantly. ” Mr. Obama ended up winning Iowa and Nevada by about six percentage points and carried Florida with a   margin, he said. But Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney also had campaign organizations capable of capitalizing on strong debate performances. “I don’t know if Trump has a great debate or gets a spike in support after it,” said Mr. Murphy, the Republican strategist, “but he certainly doesn’t have the machinery to take advantage of it by getting those people to the polls. ” Mr. Trump has pointed to the usually large numbers of people at his rallies, and their evident enthusiasm, as signs of strong support that will translate into energetic early voters. But during the Republican primaries, some Trump admirers at his rallies admitted they were not registered and had no plans to vote, and Trump advisers say that their voter registration efforts have been relatively modest. Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, urges people at her rallies to register to vote, pointing them to   volunteers who have forms to dispense and details about when, where and how to cast ballots. “Hillary’s getting into early voting details while Trump can’t get past making awful sound bites,” said Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist and media consultant. “The idea that he can fix things and win over swing voters in the final week or two  —   that’s not how elections are won anymore. It’s wishful thinking. ”"

Donald Trump met with Mexico’s  president, Enrique Peña Nieto, declaring him “a friend” and praising   as “beyond reproach” in a showstopper of a trip to Mexico City. Mr. Trump said that he and Mr. Peña Nieto of Mexico discussed a border wall when they met, but not who would pay.

5916,24016,Can You Erase the Trauma From a Place Like Sandy Hook? - The New York Times,New York Times,Avi Steinberg,2016-09-17,2016.0,9.0,,"Three and half years after the shooting that claimed 20 young students and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary, the town leaders of Newtown, Conn. along with a team of architects, led members of the media on a drizzly   morning walk around the rebuilt campus. The new Sandy Hook is a gleaming rural retreat  —   farther in the woods than the old building  —   an almost Romantic vision of streams and bridges. An uncommon amount of public money and energy has been invested in the new campus, and it shows. Designed with the help of the same security firm that consulted on the World Trade Center rebuilding, the Sandy Hook project is a uniquely contemporary piece of American architecture, a kind of   gothic: the first   campus in the United States to have been demolished and reimagined in direct response to a mass shooting. It is a reluctant but unavoidable statement project. On Sandy Hook’s media tour, guides offered the official story. Every design element, they said, “recalls” something from native ecology and local history. The building’s undulating facade, made of two kinds of hardwood  —   machiche and garapa  —   recalls the hills of the town as seen from afar. The three handmade weather vanes recall the region’s traditional architecture, and the base of the building, made of   fieldstone, recalls old New England masonry. The front lobby, with its   stained glass and matching kinetic leaf sculpture, recalls the New England autumn. What stood out most was the piece of local history that was pointedly not recalled in the design. The assembled journalists were curious to see something, anything, that recalled the people who were murdered on that site in 2012. But the closest the site itself came to memorialization were the building’s bulletproof windows. Because of this tension, the carefully choreographed tour was always just one small gesture or question away from veering awkwardly  . At one point, when the project architect directed our attention to the view from the window of one of the classrooms, I noticed the photographers in the room snapping pictures of the locks on the door. Midway through the tour, in the playground, a group of photographers descended on a brightly painted bench that had been dedicated to the memory of a Sandy Hook child and signed with the small handprints of his classmates. When a town official explained that this bench memorialized a boy who died this past year, from a medical condition unrelated to the 2012 shooting, the photographers immediately lowered their cameras and walked away. This craven need for photography was part of the reason town officials didn’t want a memorial on site. And yet the absence of any memorial seemed only to fuel this desire. After the tour ended, during the news conference, a TV reporter  —   concerned with getting a usable visual  —   asked the head of Newtown’s government, First Selectman E. Patricia Llodra, if there were “any subtle gestures to memorialize the victims that we might have missed. ” Llodra was visibly agitated by the question. She gave a terse reply: “No. ” But the design of the site told a more nuanced story. The new school was built on the grounds of the old one, but in such a way that it didn’t disturb the small area  —   formerly two classrooms, a lobby and the main hallway  —   where the shooting occurred. That patch was left conspicuously untouched, but it is not exactly a memorial. This contradiction gets at the problem inherent in a site like Sandy Hook: How do we remember the murdered, where they were murdered, without that history defining the site? (How do we tell that history, especially, when the memory is weighted with shame?) And if we don’t explicitly speak of the victims at the site, does it mean we are choosing to forget the history of the place? No other American community has gone as far as Newtown in reimagining a space where a school shooting happened. In America today, the words “Sandy Hook” have become a shorthand not just for the shooting but for the culture of shameful inaction that has taken hold in the wake of the shooting. But in Newtown, “Sandy Hook” still refers to the largest village within the town and to its school. Local people refer to the shooting as “ ” or “December 14th. ” They hope to shift the burden of memory to a day, not a place. Is it possible? A few weeks after the shootings, in January 2013, Newtown convened an open meeting with a single agenda item: what to do with the school building. In the packed Newtown High School auditorium, the moderator asked the crowd to refrain from applauding, a request he would repeat again and again that night, until he relented to the will of the people. One after another, residents walked up to the microphone and delivered anguished statements in favor of preserving the building or demolishing it. In many instances, Sandy Hook parents, mostly mothers, relayed the opinions of their young children. “My children have one wish,” one mother testified. “Everything was taken from them. Everything. They lost way too much.   …     My son was right there. It is his school. It is his school. It is not Newtown’s school. It is not the world’s school. It is his school. It is their school.   …     They need to go back. We cannot teach our children to put the lid on stuff and just forget and pretend it never happened. It happened. They were there. They know best.   …     I’m not prepared to teach my children to run and hide. Because that’s what you’re asking by tearing down Sandy Hook: You’re asking them to hide. He took too much. He cannot take this too. ” After about 40 minutes of speeches, a young mother recounted an exchange with her son, a second grader. Although the boy was excited that his temporary school had stairs for him to climb, he wanted to return to Sandy Hook Elementary, the building he loved. He asked his mother when he could go back. Her reply: “Right now we can’t go back. It’s broken. We have to figure out if we can fix it  —   and we don’t know if we can fix it. ” According to the cultural geographer Kenneth Foote, the ability to openly confront death is critical to the public process of returning a site like Sandy Hook to regular civic use. In his book, “Shadowed Ground: America’s Landscapes of Violence and Tragedy,” Foote observes that after mass murders, especially when the violence had been perpetrated by a member of the victimized community, feelings of shame or guilt are a prime motivator in our ambivalent attitudes toward a site. In particularly troubling cases, in which the violent acts are, as we say, “unspeakable,” a kind of silence indeed prevails around the space. The initial impulse is to obliterate the site and to leave it unmarked, spoken of only in whispers, or not at all. There are, in theory, alternative ways of dealing with this problem. Some cultures, Foote writes, “have rituals that serve to lift stigma, guilt or blame, ceremonies that symbolically cleanse people and places and allow them to return to full participation in    life. ” But, he writes, “this is not true of American society there is no easy way for stigmatized sites to be returned to use. ” Newtown struggled with exactly that problem: how to return the Sandy Hook site back into use without the help of an   ritual. Instead, Newtown got a consultant. In 2013, Randall Bell was brought in by a bank to advise on the question of whether to demolish the house where Adam Lanza, the shooter, had lived with his mother, and where he murdered her before setting out for Sandy Hook. Bell specializes in the field of stigmatized property, and he has consulted on cases from the home where Charles Manson’s followers murdered Sharon Tate to the mansion where Heaven’s Gate cult members committed mass suicide. For his Newtown consultation, Bell visited Colorado to investigate the fates of the homes where the two Columbine school shooters once lived. Neither was razed after the crime. Such demolitions are, Bell told me, exceedingly rare. On the day of his visit, roughly 15 years after the shootings, he discovered that one of the houses was hosting a neighborhood party to watch a Denver Broncos game. “It was just a random look, of course,” Bell told me by phone, “but it revealed a lot to me. The house was now just a normal place, part of the fabric of the community. ” This observation, which he shared with Newtown leaders, confirmed his belief that demolishing a structure doesn’t change the public’s view  —   people will continue to associate the plot of land itself with an infamous event. The only thing that removes stigma from a site is, in Bell’s experience, the passage of time. He delivered his findings to the bank that owned Lanza’s house, the first selectman and the police chief. Despite Bell’s input, Newtown decided to take the unusual step of demolishing the killer’s house and letting the ground grow wild. But the actions taken at the school site were even more extraordinary: The town decided to demolish an entire   campus, then carefully erase of every last piece of rubble. Town authorities were anxious to control the physical remains of Sandy Hook, knowing that some piece of it could end up in the hands of profiteers and the conspiracy theorists who believe the shooting never happened, that it was an orchestrated hoax perpetrated by the government. Demolition workers were ordered to sign a nondisclosure agreement that barred them from photographing or discussing their work at the site. According to this document, they were not permitted to remove “any dirt, bricks, tiles, hardware, windows, glass, doorknobs, doors. ” The debris was removed to an undisclosed location and destroyed. In May of last year, I visited the town’s municipal offices to speak with the first selectman. Llodra is a friendly,   Connecticut Republican who uses the word “persons” in conversation and speaks in rapid, decisive and   statements. She told me that she had studied the responses of other   communities but concluded that each case was culturally distinct. And the victims at Sandy Hook were so young, and there were so many of them. Newtown, in her view, was on its own. This concept became axiomatic for the 28 local leaders of a task force that set policy for the project back in 2013. Llodra returned to this theme in those   meetings, whenever doubts crept in and threatened her consensus. “There’s no precedent for what we’re doing,” she said at one point during a meeting in April 2013. “We have no history. ” Having no history meant that Newtown was operating in scary, uncharted territory, but it also gave them license to be bold. The initiative to remove all traces of the building, with the legal backing of a nondisclosure contract, was one among these unprecedented actions. “One of our biggest fears,” Llodra told me, “was that a brick from Sandy Hook would end up on eBay. We just couldn’t have that. ” There is an entire literature that explores the reasons a brick from a place like Sandy Hook might end up on eBay. Some scholars believe that because our culture considers it tasteless and morbid to talk openly about death, people who seek answers to these basic questions often go about it in tasteless and morbid ways. The impulse to handle the material of death has a socially acceptable counterpart: the creation of “spontaneous memorials,” the laying of flowers, teddy bears, letters and candles, which is one of contemporary society’s most conspicuous folk customs. Often a spontaneous memorial begins when regular citizens create a shrine as close as physically possible, usually as close as police barricades will permit, to the actual scene of the violence  —   and spreads outward from there. This pattern was followed in Newtown, and it elicited another of the town’s unusual responses: Llodra eventually ordered the removal of the folk memorials (which is not unusual) and had them ground into a fine powder (which is quite unusual). She placed this “sacred soil,” as she calls it, in safekeeping, where it remains. From the start, memorialization on site was a deeply fraught proposition for the powers that be from where they stood, Sandy Hook  —   the site  —   posed a threat to the town. The final meetings of the Sandy Hook task force in May 2013 were taken up by conversations about whether Newtown was, as the data seemed to suggest, experiencing a population decline. The committee heard the emphatic testimony of a young father, who relocated to Newtown from Chicago two years earlier. He wanted his leaders to understand that young families, like his, would find it “unconscionable” to drop their children off at a building where 26 people were murdered. “The reason we moved here, to Sandy Hook, was because of the school,” he said. If the implication wasn’t clear, the superintendent made it plain to town authorities at the next meeting: If Newtown had any chance of staying attractive to prospective young professional families in a competitive marketplace, the school system was the key. The building needed to go. The town set out to discover a new plot of land and start over. They studied more than 40 sites. Realistic alternatives were few, they learned a second site adjacent to the old plot was kept on the table simply for the sake of conversation. That conversation, as it turned out, was illuminating. The proposed second site happened to sit at an elevation that would give students and faculty a clear view over the abandoned Sandy Hook site, including, for some period of time, a view of the old building itself. The members of the task force had shuddered at the proposal. All agreed that this “pretty horrible unintended consequence,” as one put it, was too grim to consider. “I just don’t know that we gain enough emotional barriers to invest in that site,” Llodra said. The concept of erecting “emotional barriers” had perhaps always been the goal of the Sandy Hook rebuild project. But now the time had come to define what these were. When the task force was asked to imagine the view from the proposed second site, something important came into focus: It turned out that seeing the space from afar would be somehow more devastating than reinhabiting it. It was more plausible to create emotional barriers at the old site. None of this made the inevitable decision any easier. Even as the task force neared its vote, after many hours of procedural fussing and technical deliberations about traffic patterns, Brian Engel took the microphone. Engel’s    daughter, Olivia, was killed at Sandy Hook his son would soon be entering kindergarten at the school. “We’d like it to be   …     at a new location,” he said, his voice cracking, “and not at the location where [Olivia] was killed. Our family has not asked for anything since December 14th, except that the building at 12 Dickinson be razed and that the new Sandy Hook school be located at a new location. ” That same night, one of the   members testified: “To me, that is always going to be a site where 26 people were murdered. ” And at the next meeting, she voted to return the school to that site. All 28 members of the task force did. In the end, the creation of “emotional barriers” took the form of compromises. One came in the form of displacing a future official memorial far from the site. The town hasn’t yet identified a spot for a permanent Sandy Hook memorial, but they are adamant that it won’t be located at the Sandy Hook site, nor across from the school, as was done with Columbine, where a   official memorial resides on a hill overlooking the school building. Nor will it be in the center of town, where the Newtown war monuments are. The future Sandy Hook Elementary memorial will most likely live in a remote spot where a visitor might sit quietly, alone in the woods, and reflect. But the decision for a remote memorial didn’t directly resolve the problem of the site itself. Newtown decided to reorient the driveway to the school, the place where parents and emergency medical workers lived out the horror of that day. The community also decided to avoid building on the footprint of the site of the shooting: the two   classrooms, lobby and hallway near the school’s entrance. By defining the “sacred ground” of Sandy Hook as this smaller footprint, instead of the entire site, the people of Newtown could return to the old site but avoid violating its sacredness. Here again, Columbine offers a useful point of comparison. There, the community did not demolish the school but redesigned it specifically to address the problem of endlessly seeing murder at the site. The renovated Columbine, centered on a giant mural suspended from the ceiling of the cafeteria, was an attempt to pull the gaze away from the violence of that day in the past. “We wanted heads to be lifted, not hung, wondering: Where did that child die?” said Dawn Anna Townsend, whose daughter was murdered in the school’s library, at the ceremony that inaugurated the new space. In order to transform their gaze, the community decided that they had to   the traumatized space itself and find a new way to look. But in Newtown, they didn’t feel they could look again, and so they eradicated it and built a fence. I happened to discover it only by accident, in early photos of the construction site. Late in 2013, the site had been wiped clean not a shred of the former Sandy Hook building existed. During that first phase of construction, the site was basically a big empty clearing in the woods and two fences: the perimeter fence for the entire site, and inscribed within it, a green square fence. It really did resemble a kind of temple space, with nested zones of inviolability: Within the perimeter fence, only those who had signed the solemn oath (of nondisclosure) could enter, and into the inner space, nobody was permitted. Through that first winter, the fence remained there, and the snow that collected within it sat soft and untouched. And a fence remained there, protecting the ground, late into the construction project, even after the new building was nearly complete. This small enclosed piece of land marked the spot where the sacrilege of murder and the sacredness of memory lived in perpetual unhappy paradox, the place where an event whose meaning, if there is one, is so appalling and inaccessible to us, all we can do is put a fence around where it happened and declare it taboo. This fence, a literal “emotional barrier,” seemed to be the ritual object that allowed Newtown to preserve its most delicately unresolved past, while the rest of site was thrown into the upheaval of construction for the future. But maybe I was wrong. Perhaps it was just a regular old fence. When I mentioned it to the powers that be, the reactions I encountered seemed to confirm that the fence held a powerful significance to its builders. The architects refused to reply to my questions and directed me to the first selectman’s office. Llodra’s answer was even more telling. She would not confirm or deny the meaning of the fence. And she told me that if I planned to even mention the existence of the fence in this story, she would cease to cooperate with me. This could be regarded as a sign of denial. I don’t think it is. I don’t believe the efforts at nondisclosure, for example, were part of an attempt to not see, but rather an effort to see with eyes closed. During that initial meeting in January 2013, First Selectman Llodra reported to the assembled parents on conversations she’d had with state and federal agencies. Based on these discussions, she assured her constituents that Newtown would receive a great deal of financial support for any construction project they might propose. The question Llodra had posed to the state powers was, in her words, “How big can our dream be?” It struck me as an odd way to describe a project with such a horrific impetus. But maybe the new Sandy Hook really was a kind of dream, the playing out of a fantasy that preoccupies survivors of violence: the painful desire for a redo, so that, this time, trauma might be prevented. By July of this year, when I visited the school on media day, the fence was gone, and the ground it once contained was now a mound of earth, a memorial in everything but name. I discovered that day that Newtown’s official policy of silence has almost entirely succeeded. I didn’t see any of the dozens of photographers take pictures of the mound. I watched, and winced, as one photographer set up his tripod directly on top of it, to get a better angle of the new building. The reporter at the news conference who asked about memorials apparently didn’t realize that a special plot of land was visible through a window only a few feet behind her. This official silence prevailed until a man named Neil Heslin made a pilgrimage to the site. His son, Jesse Lewis, was murdered at Sandy Hook, somewhere on that plot, in what used to be his   classroom. Heslin told a reporter that he had opposed the project to rebuild at the site, and, having been overruled, decided he wanted the ground clearly marked. He had brought Jesse’s backpack with him, and, holding it aloft, he knelt down on the mound for a photo."
6016,24153,"Xi Jinping May Delay Picking China’s Next Leader, Stoking Speculation - The New York Times",New York Times,Chris Buckley,2016-10-10,2016.0,10.0,,"BEIJING  —   The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, appears prepared to defy the Communist Party’s established script for transferring power and delay the designation of his successor until after a party congress next year, unsettling the party elite and stirring speculation that he wants to prolong his tenure. The delay would buy Mr. Xi more time to promote and test favored candidates and prevent his influence from ebbing away to a    experts and political insiders said. But the price could be years of friction while a pack of aspiring cadres vie for the top job, as well as unnerving uncertainty over whether Mr. Xi wants to stay in power beyond the usual two terms as party leader. Although Mr. Xi’s decision will not be known until late 2017, the suggestion that he intends to break with precedent and begin his second term without a probable successor is magnifying uncertainties about who will rise and who will fall in the expected   including questions about the fate of the premier, Li Keqiang. “It’s a very delicate issue,” said a member of the party establishment who regularly speaks with senior officials. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the party’s ban on discussing sensitive internal decisions. “I don’t think Xi wants to decide until the people he favors have more experience, more testing,” he said. In interviews, three other party insiders close to senior officials and their families said Mr. Xi appeared likely to delay picking a successor. The succession quandary is shaping up as a defining test of the power and ambition of Mr. Xi, already China’s most dominant leader in decades. When and how his heir is chosen, and who is picked, will offer a measure of how much further Mr. Xi can bend the party’s ideas of collective rule that evolved after the upheavals of Mao Zedong’s last years. The system for succession, developed after a long period of political turmoil, was devised to help ensure a predictable, stable transition of power in the   state. Any effort by Mr. Xi to alter that compact might increase his considerable authority, but it could also inject instability into the delicately balanced system. Making predictions about Chinese leadership handovers is always perilous. The discussions are secret. Key decisions often come together late in the deliberations. And the ascendancy of Mr. Xi, opaque even by the standards of party leaders, makes forecasts even harder. “Xi Jinping has unleashed forces that open up a wide range of political futures, and each has its dangers,” David M. Lampton, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said by email. “The central policy reality is that the United States, and the next president, must be prepared to deal with a wider range of possibilities in China. ” The drama will probably begin in earnest this month, when the Central Committee, about 200 senior officials who sign off on major decisions, meets in Beijing. That meeting is likely to set in motion plans for the congress, which will meet in late 2017 to endorse a new top lineup. While it is a given that the congress will back Mr. Xi for another   term as party leader, nearly everything else is up for grabs, giving Mr. Xi great sway to shape the new leadership. Five of the seven members of the powerful Politburo Standing Committee must step down because of age, assuming the informal retirement age of 68 holds. That leaves only Mr. Xi, 63, and Mr. Li, 61, to return. In the broader Politburo, the second tier of party authority, nearly half the 25 members are likely to retire. Two terms as party leader has evolved as the standard since the 1990s, and an heir apparent is usually clear by the start of the second. The selection requires a consensus of the party elite, the product of    wrangling. The previous two presidents had to accept successors who were not their picks. But Mr. Xi’s blistering anticorruption campaign and amassing of power have shaken the idea that Chinese elite politics has settled into a stolid routine under collective control. If China’s party leaders function like a corporate board, Mr. Xi is akin to the celebrity chairman who may have the power to stare down opposition to his succession plan. “Having played the strongman politics since coming to power, Xi would be the least likely person to feel constrained by these unspoken rules” of succession, said Warren Sun, a researcher on Chinese Communist Party history at Monash University in Australia. Delaying the choice of a successor would allow time for Mr. Xi’s favorites to prove their ability and loyalty, experts said. The latter could allow Mr. Xi to continue to wield power behind the scenes after he retires. But it could also create “severe friction” in the next five years, said Sebastian Heilmann, the president of the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. “Not designating a successor could be seen as a trick by Xi to grab a third term,” he said. The risk of elite infighting, as well as demands from other senior officials and retired leaders, could still force Mr. Xi to signal his successor next year, several experts said. “Even the amount of consolidation of power so far may have raised hackles,” said Susan Shirk, the chairwoman of the 21st Century China Program at the University of California, San Diego. “I don’t think Xi will want to further raise alarms about Putinesque intentions. ” If he is pressed to name someone, a younger Politburo member like Sun Zhengcai, the party secretary of Chongqing, could gain support. The world may not know who has won and lost until Mr. Xi introduces his new team after the congress ends late next year. But some officials and analysts are already saying that he wants to shunt Mr. Li, the premier, into a lesser job. There are whispers that Mr. Xi wants to raise the retirement age for the Standing Committee so that Wang Qishan, the powerful head of the party’s anticorruption agency, can stay on, possibly to replace Mr. Li. Mr. Wang, a longtime friend of Mr. Xi’s, spent a career as an economic firefighter before taking his current job, in which he has helped Mr. Xi oust potential opponents. Mr. Wang will be 69 by the time of the next congress, but changing the retirement age for political expediency is not  . It was 70 before Jiang Zemin lowered it so he could force out a political rival in 2002. Predicting what happens depends on “whether or not you think the de facto rules and norms of elite succession will hold,” said Evan S. Medeiros, the former senior director for Asian affairs in the National Security Council under President Obama. “If not, predicting outcomes is a crapshoot. ” Mao and Deng Xiaoping chose favored successors only to dump them later, creating instability and bad blood in the party. On the other hand, Mr. Xi’s predecessor Hu Jintao spent a decade in preparation as heir apparent but still struggled as leader to run a team dominated by men installed by his predecessor, Mr. Jiang. Mr. Xi and other Chinese leaders hold that it was the poor choice of Mikhail S. Gorbachev to lead the Soviet Union that precipitated its demise. “Finally, all it took was one quiet word from Gorbachev to declare the dissolution of the Soviet Communist Party, and a great party was gone,” Mr. Xi said after he was appointed Chinese leader in 2012. “In the end nobody was a real man. ” The dilemma for Mr. Xi is that the politicians who will remain in the top echelons after next year’s retirements do not have long experience working with Mr. Xi or the right set of postings in provincial and central government, according to several experts and people who speak to senior officials. But the rising provincial leaders considered closest to him lack the experience to be taken seriously as the next national leader in waiting. Perhaps the biggest subject of speculation is that Mr. Xi is bent on staying in power after his second term ends in 2022. The Constitution requires that he retire after two terms as president, but there is no limit on the more powerful job, general secretary of the party. There is, however, an informal limit, which, like collective rule by the party elite, was instituted by Deng to prevent another    like Mao. Even if he delays picking a successor, that does not mean he is determined to stay on as leader past 2022, when he will be 69, said Christopher K. Johnson, a senior China analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “The only thing he’s focused on right now is next fall,” Mr. Johnson said. “If he gets his way next fall, which I think would mean they don’t signal the successor, that doesn’t then mean he’s already decided to stay on forever. ”"
6076,24229,"After Donald Trump, Will More Women Believe Their Own Stories? - The New York Times",New York Times,Susan Dominus,2016-10-14,2016.0,10.0,,"A week ago, it would have seemed wildly unlikely to most people that Donald J. Trump, not Hillary Clinton, would be the candidate more likely to provoke a   shift in how we think of and talk about sexual assault. But since the release on Friday of a recording in which Trump essentially admits he has a habit of sexually assaulting women, a series of stories involving the Republican nominee seems to be doing just that. Consider the story of the former People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff, whom Trump reportedly pushed up against a wall and kissed in 2005. Stoynoff chose to move on with her life rather than speak publicly about what she says Trump did to her. Even as a   working woman, she writes that she still partly blamed herself for the assault well into this year, believing that at some level, she had surely somehow encouraged it. She could not shake the idea of her own culpability until the moment she heard Trump on tape saying he did this kind of thing as a matter of course. “I finally understood for sure that I was not to blame for his inappropriate behavior,” she wrote. Her choices and her thinking, all those years before she told her story  —   they sound familiar. Surely many women her age and older would still respond to those circumstances the way she did, with silence and shame. Certainly, Jessica Leeds, who spoke to The New York Times about an encounter in which she said Trump groped her on a plane, came of age at a time when women were taught, as she put it, “it was our fault. ” Trump’s own camp seems to be working hard to perpetuate the kind of thinking that blames the woman: Eric Trump said in August that a “strong, powerful woman” like his sister Ivanka wouldn’t allow sexual harassment to happen to her. This is not the first time that the subject of a man’s unwanted sexual overtures has emerged unexpectedly from the churning of the political process, and has then come to dominate it. Fourteen years before Stoynoff’s experience, the law professor Anita Hill testified, during Justice Clarence Thomas’s confirmation hearings, that Thomas had sexually harassed her when she worked for him at, of all places, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The following year,   numbers of women swept into Congress  —   many of them, some have argued, supported by women repulsed not only by Hill’s story, but also by the sight of so many white men on the Senate Judiciary Committee grilling Hill, a black woman, about her motives and questioning her character. If Hill’s single story of sexual harassment had the ultimate effect of galvanizing women, imagine what might happen now that the issue is sexual assault  —   as numerous women have stepped forward to talk about the way Trump helped himself to their body parts. The message of Anita Hill’s experience was this: If you don’t think this is important, if you don’t think this happens to women every day, then you don’t get it. In the past few years, an insistence that women’s right to live free of sexual harassment or assault has picked up new energy, as women on campuses have fiercely taken up the cause. Last year, dozens of women stepped forward to tell their stories of being sexually assaulted by Bill Cosby, empowering other women to speak out about their own experiences, rather than remain silent for fear of being discredited. Hillary Clinton has said, using the words of current feminism, that every rape victim has “the right to be believed. ” (Trump’s supporters have used these words against her, revisiting her role as a defense lawyer in a 1975   case, even as they now deny the credibility of any of the women accusing Trump of molesting them.) But Stoynoff’s story speaks to the durability of ingrained, downright biblical ideas about women’s sinning,   ways. It also testifies to the inevitable advantages conferred by power on those who have it. So what exactly would it take for more women to feel empowered, for more men’s consciousness to be raised on the subject? Maybe this presidential election, of all things, will be another milestone. Grueling and sordid or not, it has placed matters of sex, power and gender at the center of the national conversation, not off in the peripheral space typically reserved for women’s issues in media. It is one thing to be a passive reader of the news about Cosby, or the trials endured by young women on college campuses it is another for the public to consider their electoral choices in light of those kinds of issues. Oddly enough, there is, right now, outrage about the unwanted groping of women among both Republicans and Democrats  —   different men, different victims, but same idea. Is there any bipartisan issue more relevant, or more emotional, than this one? Perhaps Trump is the ultimate gift to feminists: a grabber and bragger who has focused the world’s attention on the outrages women quietly endure on a chronic basis without notice. And perhaps we can now see the   response to Bill Clinton’s own accusers  —   subdued or defensive among liberals on account of his   politics  —   as a near miss of an opportunity, a cultural shift that could have built on the momentum of Anita Hill, but never did. The stories emerging about Trump, as well as his own words, could give women a new way of seeing their own experiences with sexual assault going forward  —   as part of a pattern of male behavior that has been noted, flagged and loudly denigrated."
6192,24379,N.F.L.: The New England Patriots Are Beatable. The Cowboys? Maybe Not. - The New York Times,New York Times,Benjamin Hoffman,2016-11-20,2016.0,11.0,,"   games and   victories were in style once again in N. F. L. Week 10. Here’s what we learned from an exciting Sunday: ■ The Dallas Cowboys are too young to lose the games they are supposed to lose. The team’s winning streak already included a win at Lambeau Field over Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers, and this week the team’s rookies led the way to beat Ben Roethlisberger and the Pittsburgh Steelers at Heinz Field. The game also proved that a potential scoring play for Ezekiel Elliott is any play in which the rookie running back touches the ball. ■ Tom Brady is a human being, which means the Patriots are beatable. The New England quarterback had been in   revenge mode since his suspension ended, but in a loss to Seattle he was held without a touchdown pass, threw the first interception by a New England quarterback this season, and botched things at the goal line at the end of the game, handing the win to Seattle. Next thing you know, he’ll start having feelings and perhaps, eventually, age. ■ New rules create new ways to win games. New Orleans was going for a   extra point in a wild game against Denver when Justin Simmons leaped over the offensive line, blocked the kick, and watched as his fellow rookie, Will Parks, ran the ball all the way back for a     conversion return. It was the first time that a team has won a game on the defensive scoring play that was created last season in a move to add some potential drama to extra points. The move worked. ■ The Chiefs should not be counted out. Kansas City may not have a powerhouse offense, but the team beat the Carolina Panthers despite having trailed   late in the second quarter. ■ David Johnson will get his 100 yards from scrimmage. The   running back of the Arizona Cardinals has gained 100 or more yards for scrimmage in all nine of his team’s games. He cut things close last week, with 24 rushing yards and 84 receiving yards in a loss to Carolina, and his margin was even thinner this week in a win over San Francisco, with 55 on the ground and 46 through the air. In a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX, the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks proved they are still evenly matched, as the game featured seven lead changes. It came down to a   play once again, and this time it was Seattle that held strong, escaping with a   victory on the road. The game, which featured three receiving touchdowns by Doug Baldwin of the Seahawks, three rushing touchdowns by LeGarrette Blount of the Patriots, and the first interception thrown by a Patriots quarterback this season, had plenty of highlights on both sides. It even went as far as to feature a mild   of the famous   play from the Super Bowl in which Malcolm Butler intercepted a pass at the goal line to seal New England’s victory. Sunday’s version was a    and the Seahawks once again threw right at Butler. He was a step too slow, and Russell Wilson’s pass found Baldwin for the first of their three touchdown connections. But it was a     pass attempt from Tom Brady to Rob Gronkowski in the final seconds of the game that sailed out of the tight end’s reach and ended New England’s hopes of a    victory. Gronkowski was locked up with Seattle safety Kam Chancellor, but no flags were thrown. The Patriots, down 7 with under a minute left in regulation, appeared to be in great shape with a    from the   line, but they couldn’t punch it in on three straight run plays. In an   interview, Chancellor, who had played a key role in the   stand by covering Gronkowski on the final play and catching Blount from behind on second down, said his team’s   was key to hanging on for victory. “Mental toughness, physical toughness and never giving up,” Chancellor said. “That’s one thing we preach on our team, we want to fight until we can’t fight no more. ” Wilson, while not necessarily at his best, appeared to have regained some of the mobility that he has been missing for much of this season and used it to complete 25 of 37 passes for 348 yards and three touchdowns. He got plenty of help from C. J. Prosise, a rookie running back making his first N. F. L. start, who had 66 rushing yards while catching seven passes for 87 yards. On the other side of the ball, the Seahawks’   defense was able to make Brady look more human than he has at any point since returning from a   suspension. He failed to throw a touchdown pass for the first time this season, and the Patriots’ streak of 258 passes to start the season without an interception ended when Brady, hoping to avoid the   threw a ball right into the waiting hands of DeShawn Shead. Brady’s last regular season interception had come in the third quarter of a Week 16 loss to the Jets last season. In the ongoing quarterback controversy for the Dallas Cowboys, Ezekiel Elliott just saved Dak Prescott’s starting position for him. Things looked bad for Prescott when Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger did his best impersonation of Dan Marino late in the fourth quarter, faking a spike to stop the clock and throwing a   touchdown pass that looked like it would end Dallas’   winning streak. But Elliott was not done, and the rookie running back broke free for a   touchdown run with just nine seconds remaining to secure a   victory for the Cowboys. Read more about the Cowboys’ victory here. The 452nd passing touchdown of Drew Brees’s career appeared to secure an unlikely win for the New Orleans Saints over the Denver Broncos, but a blocked extra point turned into two points and a shocking   victory for the Broncos. It was a game of wild momentum changes, with the Broncos scoring the first 10 points, the Saints scoring the next 17, and then the teams trading points back and forth. But after Brees, who earlier in the game had become just the third player to have 450 passing career touchdowns, found Brandin Cooks for a   touchdown with 1:22 remaining it looked like New Orleans had taken care of business at home. It all changed on Wil Lutz’s   attempt. Justin Simmons, a rookie safety, was able to leap over the offensive line and block the kick. Another rookie safety, Will Parks, recovered the ball and streaked down the sideline on the unusual turnover, which is good for two points. While many will focus on whether Parks’s foot went out of bounds on the return, the Broncos won the game not just because of the return but also because they dominated time of possession. The Broncos controlled the ball for 39 minutes 22 seconds compared to the Saints having it for 20 minutes 38 seconds. Denver was also able to force four turnovers, including three by Darian Stewart, who intercepted consecutive passes by Brees in the first half and had a fumble recovery in the second half. A week after losing to the Oakland Raiders, and giving up a tie at the top of the A. F. C. West, the Broncos have now closed Oakland’s lead to a   as the Raiders are off this week. Philadelphia’s defense was able to bend but not break against the   Atlanta offense, and Ryan Mathews took care of the rest as the Eagles beat the Falcons,  . Carson Wentz completed nine of his first 10 passes for the Eagles, and 25 of 36 overall, but it was Mathews running for 108 yards and two touchdowns that ended up providing the offensive spark necessary in the game as the Falcons were limited to just one touchdown and three field goals. Matt Ryan ended up topping Wentz in terms of passing yards, with 267 to Wentz’s 231, but with his team trailing by nine with less than two minutes remaining, he was intercepted by Leodis McKelvin, sealing Atlanta’s fate. Elsewhere around the N. F. L. in Week 10: Chiefs Steal One From Panthers: The Kansas City Chiefs had no offensive touchdowns, and their defense was on the field for much of the afternoon. No big deal. They found another way to win  —   again. Marcus Peters stripped Kelvin Benjamin with 20 seconds left, Cairo Santos kicked a   field goal as time expired, and the Chiefs overcame a   deficit to top the Carolina Panthers,   on Sunday. The game was tied when Benjamin caught a   pass from Cam Newton at his own 34. Peters ripped the ball from his arms and returned it to the Carolina 24. “I took it from him. It was simple,” Peters said.  —   Associated Press Titans Dominate Packers: Marcus Mariota threw for 295 yards and four touchdowns and the Tennessee Titans routed the Green Bay Packers,  . Five Titans scored a touchdown in the first half as Tennessee put together its best scoring performance this season. With the win, the Titans ( ) also matched the five victories over the past two seasons combined. The Packers ( ) started a   road swing by losing their third straight. Green Bay has lost four of five in dropping below . 500 for the first time since 2008, Aaron Rodgers’s first year as a starter.  —   Associated Press Jets Lose With Petty at QB: Alec Ogletree saw the football zipping his way and knew he needed to get his hands on it. The Los Angeles linebacker intercepted Bryce Petty with just under two minutes left, lifting the Rams to a   victory over the New York Jets in a snoozer. Read our report here.   Dooms Chargers: Miami Dolphins linebacker Kiko Alonso couldn’t have played his first career   any better. It was the highlight play of his career so far, and left the San Diego Chargers stunned, again. Alonso deked Philip Rivers into thinking he was going to cover a slot receiver, then broke off, jumped in front of Tyrell Williams for the interception and outraced everyone 60 yards to the end zone with 1:01 left to give the Dolphins a wild   victory.  —   Associated Press Vikings Lose Fourth Straight: Kirk Cousins threw for two touchdowns, Preston Smith had two sacks and a   interception, and the Washington Redskins beat the Minnesota Vikings,   for their first victory in almost a month.

6900,25319,G.M. Job Shift From Mexico Tests a Trump Premise - The New York Times,New York Times,Peter S. Goodman,2016-09-21,2016.0,9.0,,"In the realm of international trade, it is a truism seemingly as consistent as gravity: Jobs and investment flow from north to south, while manufactured goods travel the other way around. Factories in the United States and Canada shutter as work shifts to Mexico and Central America, where human hands do it more cheaply. So the established order of trade was by all appearances turned upside down on Tuesday, as General Motors agreed to cease manufacturing an automobile engine at a factory in Mexico while moving jobs to a plant in Canada. One might reflexively assume that this turn effectively validates a central promise made repeatedly by Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential aspirant. Loudly and frequently, Mr. Trump has vowed to yank jobs back to America from Mexico, using shame, executive fiat and his uniquely Trumpian form of threats to make it happen. Here was apparent proof that such a goal was doable. Except life turns out to be more complicated than that. The General Motors deal does indeed signal that work can today wind up transferred seemingly anywhere  —   never mind the   pathway of north to south. In an era of increasingly sophisticated manufacturing that relies more on computers and robotics than   hands, centers of innovation like Canada and the United States will exert a greater pull than before. This plays well to Mr. Trump’s premise that a robust era of American job growth awaits, if only the nation selects a president with the audacity to set aside the niceties of trade agreements and begin acting like a   superpower, dictating the terms of commerce. And it speaks to one group of voters that has embraced him  —   dispossessed factory workers prone to blaming globalization for lost jobs, declining wages and financial anxiety. But consider this deal more of a caveat added to the dominant narrative than some revolutionary twist to the story of globalization. “You can bring some jobs back, but they will likely be more of a drip than a big flow,” said Jared Bernstein, a former White House economic adviser in the Obama administration, and now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. “Trump has a very nostalgic view of globalization, circa 1950. ” “Broadly speaking, the trends that have hurt communities here in terms of trade and trade deficits are very much ongoing, and if that gets turned around, it’s not going to be about bringing all the old jobs back,” he said. “It’s going to be about forging new sectors like advanced manufacturing. ” Which is to say, sectors where a handful of highly skilled people with degrees and technical prowess earn a good deal of money. And   workers  —   the ones who lost jobs to China and Mexico and are now embracing Mr. Trump  —   continue to be left behind. Far from representing a reversal of course, the G. M. deal then underscores how multinationals are   their approach to making things. They are increasingly differentiating between more   manufacturing  —   tasks like stitching bluejeans and snapping together cellphone cases  —   and more advanced,   pursuits that rely on automation and software. Given that     products fetch a higher price, it is presumably worth paying a premium to the limited numbers of humans involved in their creation  —   and especially since this buys proximity to the minds that dream up lucrative new visions. The Canadian plant getting the jobs sits near Waterloo, the birthplace of the BlackBerry, which is something like Canada’s Silicon Valley. The union in Canada won something    —   jobs retrieved from Mexico. But it also relented on a major objective sought by G. M.: Workers gave up the fight to retain   pensions that pay out fixed amounts. They accepted newfangled plans that see benefits fluctuate with the markets. Far from proof that Canadian workers have somehow recaptured the upper hand in jockeying for the spoils of globalization, this deal is just the latest evidence that companies have effectively used international factories to permanently tilt the power dynamics in their favor. For decades, global automakers have been on the march for lower costs. In the United States, they shifted factories from union strongholds like Michigan and Wisconsin to Southern states like South Carolina and Alabama, where union ranks were weak and local rules limited labor organizing. Then, they kept moving south, to Mexico, exploiting a series of trade deals  —   not least the North American Free Trade Agreement. A quarter century ago, the   presidential candidate, Ross Perot, spoke of a “giant sucking sound” in warning that factory work was being vacuumed up by Mexico, with American communities abandoned. For workers in Canada and Mexico, the impacts were evident. They had to satisfy the demands of auto manufacturers locked in an increasingly global competition. They had to make concessions. Otherwise, the car companies could employ their demonstrated power to leave them behind, moving the work to places where labor was cheaper and more pliable. The G. M. deal affirms this reality. Labor paid a price for gaining jobs in Canada  —   downgraded retirement. Above all, the deal underscores the potency of markets in shaping what happens in commercial life, a force far more powerful than demagogues making dubious promises about tearing up trade deals. Canada’s unions are relatively strong, and the nation’s currency is relatively weak, making   goods cheaper in the global marketplace. G. M. was willing to pay for access to highly skilled working hands, provided it got a break on its pension contributions. These factors coalesced into a negotiated result. The jobs did not come back to Canada because of the sort of edict Mr. Trump has promised to unleash, somehow compelling global companies to stop making things in Mexico and resume making them in the United States. “The central Trump fallacy here is that the president can tell multinational companies what to do,” said Mr. Bernstein, the former Obama administration economic adviser. “That’s completely wrong, I’ve seen that firsthand. President Obama was constantly exhorting companies to create more jobs, and they’ll only do so if they want to,” he added. “Simply calling multinational C. E. O.s from the Oval Office and yelling at them isn’t going to do anything. ” If Mr. Trump really did seek to dictate to General Motors (or any company) where it can make its wares, that would risk undermining the company’s competitiveness. If, under threat of political action, a company had to buy steel from an American producer instead of China, that could make its cars more expensive than competing models from Honda or Hyundai. If they had to use American workers for final assembly instead of Mexicans, that could damage their business and undercut sales for many suppliers, from glassmakers in Ohio to auto parts manufacturers in Indiana. “Then,” said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, “those jobs that came back from Mexico aren’t going to be any jobs at all. ”"
7013,25477,Where Even Nightmares Are Classified: Psychiatric Care at Guantánamo - The New York Times,New York Times,Sheri Fink,2016-12-16,2016.0,12.0,,"Every day when Lt. Cmdr. Shay Rosecrans crossed into the military detention center at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, she tucked her medical school class ring into her bra, covered the name on her uniform with tape and hid her necklace under her   especially if she was wearing a cross. She tried to block out thoughts of her    daughter. Dr. Rosecrans, a Navy psychiatrist, had been warned not to speak about her family or display anything personal, clues that might allow a terrorism suspect to identify her. Patients called her “torture bitch,” spat at her   and shouted death threats, she said. One hurled a cup of urine, feces and other fluids at a psychologist working with her. Even interviewing prisoners to assess their mental health set off recriminations and claims that she was torturing them. “What would your Jesus think?” they demanded. Dr. Rosecrans, now retired from the Navy, led one of the mental health teams assigned to care for detainees at the island prison over the past 15 years. Some prisoners had arrived disturbed  —   traumatized adolescents hauled in from the battlefield, unstable adults who disrupted the cellblocks. Others, facing indefinite confinement, struggled with despair. Then there were prisoners who had developed symptoms including hallucinations, nightmares, anxiety or depression after undergoing brutal interrogations at the hands of Americans who were advised by other health personnel. At Guantánamo, a willful blindness to the consequences emerged. Those equipped to diagnose, document and treat the effects  —   psychiatrists, psychologists and mental health teams  —   were often unaware of what had happened. Sometimes by instruction and sometimes by choice, they typically did not ask what the prisoners had experienced in interrogations, current and former military doctors said. That compromised care, according to outside physicians working with legal defense teams, previously undisclosed medical records and court filings. Dozens of men who underwent agonizing treatment in secret C. I. A. prisons or at Guantánamo were left with psychological problems that persisted for years, despite government lawyers’ assurances that the practices did not constitute torture and would cause no lasting harm, The New York Times has reported. Some men should never have been held, government investigators concluded.   Donald J. Trump declared during his campaign that he would bring back banned interrogation tactics, including waterboarding, and authorize others that were “much worse. ” In recent interviews, more than two dozen military medical personnel who served or consulted at Guantánamo provided the most detailed account to date of mental health care there. Almost from the start, the shadow of interrogation and mutual suspicion tainted the mission of those treating prisoners. That limited their effectiveness for years to come. Psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses and technicians received little training for the assignment and, they said, felt unprepared to tend to men they were told were “the worst of the worst. ” Doctors felt pushed to cross ethical boundaries, and were warned that their actions, at an institution roiled by detainees’ organized resistance, could have political and national security implications. Rotations lasted only three to nine months, making it difficult to establish rapport. In a field that requires intimacy, the psychiatrists and their teams long used pseudonyms like Major Psych, Dr. Crocodile, Superman and Big Momma, and referred to patients by serial numbers, not names. They frequently had to speak through fences or slits in cell doors, using interpreters who also worked with interrogators. Wary patients often declined to talk to the mental health teams. (“Detainee refused to interact,” medical records note repeatedly.) At a place so shrouded in secrecy that for years any information learned from a detainee was to be treated as classified, what went on in interrogations “was completely restricted territory,” said Karen Thurman, a Navy commander, now retired, who served as a psychiatric nurse practitioner at Guantánamo. “‘How did it go? ’” Or “‘Did they hit you?’ We were not allowed to ask that,” she said. Dr. Rosecrans said she held back on such questions when she was there in 2004, not suspecting abuse and feeling constrained by the prison environment. “From a surgical perspective, you never open up a wound you cannot close,” she said. “Unless you have months, years, to help this person and help them get out of this hole, why would you ever do this?” The United States military defends the quality of mental health care at Guantánamo as humane and appropriate. Detainees, human rights groups and doctors consulting for defense teams offer more critical assessments, describing it as negligent or ineffective in many cases. Those who served at the prison, most of whom had never spoken publicly before, said they had helped their patients and had done the best they could. Given the circumstances, many focused on the most basic of duties. “My goal was to keep everyone alive,” Dr. Rosecrans said. “We tried to keep the water as smooth as possible,” Ms. Thurman said. “My job was to keep them going,” said Andy Davidson, a Navy captain, now retired, and psychologist. When Dr. Rosecrans worked briefly at the Navy’s hospital at Guantánamo as a young psychiatrist in 1999, it was a sleepy assignment. She saw only a few outpatients each week, and there was no psychiatric ward on the base, which was being downsized. But after Al Qaeda’s 2001 terror attacks on New York and the Pentagon, and the subsequent   invasion of Afghanistan, detainees began pouring into the island in early 2002  —   airplane loads of 20 to 30 men in shackles and   goggles. “We were seeing prisoners arriving with mental problems,” said Capt. Albert Shimkus, then the hospital’s commanding officer. There were no clear protocols for treating patients considered to be “enemy combatants,” rather than prisoners of war, said Captain Shimkus, who is now retired. But he set out, with the tacit support of his commanders, to provide a level of care equivalent to that for American service members. He transformed a cellblock into a spartan inpatient unit for up to 20 patients and brought in Navy psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses and technicians to be available around the clock. Many of them had little or no predeployment training, experience working in a detention facility or familiarity with the captives’ languages, cultures or religious beliefs. They soon heard talk of the threat the prisoners posed. “The crew that was there before us scared the heck out of us,” said Dr. Christopher Kowalsky, who as a Navy captain led the mental health unit in 2004. He and Dr. Rosecrans said colleagues had admonished them for getting too close to patients. “‘Don’t forget they’re criminals,’” she was told. Those arriving in later years attended a training program at a military base in Washington State. “You heard all these things about how terrible they are: Not only will they gouge your eyes out, but they’ll somehow tell their cohorts to go after your family,” said Daniel Lakemacher, who served as a Navy psychiatric technician. “I became extremely hateful and spiteful. ” Peering through small openings in cell doors, he and other technicians handed out medications, watched prisoners swallow them and ran through a checklist of safety questions  —   “Are you having thoughts of hurting yourself?” “Are you seeing things that aren’t there?”  —   through interpreters or   detainees in nearby cells. (“Talk about confidentiality!” Dr. Davidson said. “It’s just a whole other set of rules. ”) Conflicts arose between health professionals aiding interrogators and those trying to provide care. Army psychologists working with military intelligence teams showed up in 2002 and asked to be credentialed to treat detainees. “I said no, because they were there for interrogations,” Captain Shimkus said. In June of that year, Maj. Paul Burney, an Army psychiatrist, and Maj. John Leso, an Army psychologist, both of whom had deployed to Guantánamo to tend to the troops, instead were assigned to devise interrogation techniques. In a memo, they listed escalating pressure tactics, including extended isolation,   interrogations, painful stress positions, yelling, hooding, and manipulation of diet, environment and sleep. But they also expressed caution. “Physical   emotional harm from the above techniques may emerge months or even years after their use,” the two men warned in their memo, later excerpted in a Senate Armed Services Committee report. They added that the most effective interrogation strategy was developing a bond. A version of the memo, stripped of its warnings, reached Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. In December 2002, he approved many of the methods for Guantánamo, some of them similar to the “enhanced interrogation techniques” used by the C. I. A. at secret prisons overseas. After objections from military lawyers, he made some modifications but gave commanders license to use 24 techniques. Some of them later migrated to military prisons in Afghanistan and Iraq, including Abu Ghraib, where they morphed into horrific abuses. “I think it was the absolute wrong way to proceed,” Dr. Burney, who has not previously commented publicly, said of the approved techniques. “I so wish I could go back and do things differently. ” He and Dr. Leso created the Behavioral Science Consultation Team, or BSCT (pronounced “biscuit”) to advise and sometimes rein in military interrogators, many of them young enlisted soldiers with little experience even interviewing people. The interrogators subjected some detainees at Guantánamo to loud music, strobe lights, cold temperatures, isolation, painful shackling, threats against family members and prolonged sleep deprivation, according to the Justice Department’s inspector general. The government has never quantified how many prisoners underwent that treatment. In four cases, military leaders approved even harsher interrogation plans. At least two were carried out. Dr. Burney said he and Dr. Leso took turns observing the questioning in 2002 of Mohammed   who was accused of being an intended hijacker in the Sept. 11 attacks and, it later emerged, had a history of psychosis. Among other things, he was menaced with military dogs, draped in women’s underwear, injected with intravenous fluids to make him urinate on himself, put on a leash and forced to bark like a dog, and interrogated for 18 to 20 hours at least 48 times, government investigators found. Mr. Qahtani was led to believe that he might die if he did not cooperate, Dr. Burney said in a statement provided to the Senate committee. When Mr. Qahtani asked for a doctor to relieve psychological symptoms, the interrogators instead performed an exorcism for “jinns”  —   supernatural creatures that he believed caused his problems. In 2009, a Department of Defense official overseeing military commissions refused to prosecute Mr. Qahtani, telling The Washington Post that his mistreatment had amounted to torture. In 2012, a federal judge found Mr. Qahtani incompetent to help challenge his detention. Those providing mental health care at Guantánamo quickly aroused the suspicions of some prisoners, who called them devils, criminals and dogs. “Nobody trusted them,” said Lutfi bin Ali, a Tunisian who was sent to Guantánamo after being subjected to harsh conditions at what he described as an American jail overseas. “There was skepticism that they were psychiatrists and that they were trying to help us,” he said by phone from Kazakhstan, where he was transferred to in 2014. He still suffers intermittently from depression. Dr. Davidson, who treated prisoners at Guantánamo during part of 2003, recalled the hostility. “I can tell the guy until the cows come home, ‘Hey, I’m just here for mental health,’” he said. “‘No, you’re not,’” he imagined the patient thinking, “‘you’re the enemy. ’” One day on the cellblocks, Dr. Rosecrans heard detainees warn others that she could not be trusted. “Some of my patients hated me,” she said. “They saw me as a representative of the government. ” She and other clinicians who felt uncomfortable walking around the prison grounds relied mostly on guards to identify detainees who needed help and to take them to an examination room, where they would be chained to the floor. Interpreters were in such short supply at times that they worked with both the mental health teams and the interrogators. “See where that could be a problem?” Dr. Rosecrans asked. All of that fed the conviction among detainees that information about their mental health was being exploited by interrogators. “If you complain about your weak point to a doctor, they told that to the interrogators,” said Younous Chekkouri, a Moroccan, now released. He recalled seeing one psychologist working alongside interrogators and then treating detainees at the prison. Only years later, he said, did he feel he could trust certain psychiatrists there. He said he still suffered from flashbacks and anxiety after being beaten at a military prison in Afghanistan, and kept in isolation and shown execution photos at Guantánamo. Captain Shimkus, who oversaw patient care, said some clinicians had expressed concerns about the blurred lines between medical care and interrogation. He said he had allowed one psychiatrist, who was disturbed by the lack of confidentiality, to temporarily recuse himself from caring for patients because the doctor believed “the   relationship was compromised. ” The United States Southern Command told health care providers at Guantánamo in 2002 that their communications with patients were “not confidential. ” At first, interrogators had direct access to medical information. Then, the BSCT psychologists acted as liaisons. They regularly read patient records in the psychiatry ward, said Dr. Frances Stewart, a retired Navy captain and psychiatrist who treated detainees in 2003 and 2004. As a consequence, she said, “I tried to document just the things that really needed to be documented  —   things like ‘the patient has a headache we treated it with Tylenol’  —   not anything terribly sensitive. It was not a perfect solution, but it was probably the best solution I could come up with at the time. ” Dr. Kowalsky, a psychiatrist, said patients had begged him not to record their diagnoses. “They’re going to use that,” some detainees told him. The International Committee of the Red Cross, during a June 2004 visit, documented the same complaint. Medical files, the group said in confidential remarks  revealed in The  Times, were regularly used to devise strategies for interrogations that it called “tantamount to torture. ” Interrogators’ access to medical records was a “flagrant violation of medical ethics. ” The Pentagon disputed that the records were used to harm detainees. Dr. Kowalsky said he clashed with a BSCT psychologist, Diane Zierhoffer, who showed up in the psychiatric unit to look at patient records in 2004. (Dr. Zierhoffer, in an email, said her intent in accessing records had been to “ensure health care was not interfered with. ”) “We’re here to help people,” Dr. Kowalsky recalled once telling her. “We’re here to protect our country,” he said she had responded, later asking: “Whose side are you on?” Sometimes it wasn’t clear what was forbidden or what had just become practice, but it had the same effect: Psychiatrists and psychologists said they had almost never asked a detainee about his treatment by interrogators, either at Guantánamo or at the C. I. A. prisons. Mohamedou Ould Slahi, who was released to his native Mauritania in October after 14 years at Guantánamo, told a doctor on his legal team that military mental health providers did not ask him about possible mistreatment, according to a sealed court report obtained by The Times. Mr. Slahi did not volunteer the information because he was afraid of retaliation, he wrote in his prison memoir, “Guantánamo Diary. ” Mr. Slahi endured some of the most brutal treatment there. Investigations by the Army, the Justice Department and the Senate largely corroborated his account of being deprived of sleep beaten shackled in painful positions forced to drink large amounts of water isolated in darkness and exposed to extreme temperatures stripped and soaked in cold water told that his mother might be sent to Guantánamo and sexually assaulted by female interrogators. Decades earlier, he had joined the insurgency against the   government in Afghanistan, a cause supported by the United States. In 1991, he attended a Qaeda training camp, and was later suspected of recruiting for the terrorist group. A federal judge ordered him freed in 2010 for lack of evidence, but an appeals court overturned the decision. In July, a military review board recommended his transfer. Prison medical records show that Mr. Slahi, a computer specialist with no history of mental illness, received   medicine, antidepressants, sleeping pills and psychotherapy, and that he had recurring nightmares of being tortured in the years after his ordeal. Dr. Vincent Iacopino, a civilian physician who evaluated Mr. Slahi in 2007 for his defense team, criticized psychologists and psychiatrists at Guantánamo for failing “to adequately pursue the obvious possibility of PTSD,” or   stress disorder, linked to severe physical and mental harm, the records show. Dr. Iacopino said military doctors had medicated Mr. Slahi for his symptoms instead of trying to treat his underlying disorder, which had “profound   and debilitating psychological effects. ” Last year, one of Mr. Slahi’s lawyers described him as “damaged. ” He was one of nearly 800 men incarcerated at Guantánamo over the years and one of several whose confessions were tainted by mistreatment and disallowed as evidence by the United States. Many prisoners were Qaeda and Taliban foot soldiers later deemed to pose little threat. Some were victims of mistaken identity or held on flimsy evidence. Dr. Burney, who assisted the interrogators, said he had seen many detainees’ files. “It seemed like there wasn’t a whole lot of evidence about anything for a whole lot of those folks,” he said. After the C. I. A. ’s secret prisons were shut in 2006, Guantánamo took in more than a dozen     detainees, including those accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks. Some doctors at Guantánamo said they had been instructed, in briefings or by colleagues, not to ask these former “black site” prisoners about what had happened there. Virtually everything about these captives was classified until a Senate Intelligence Committee report in 2014 disclosed grisly details about torture. “You just weren’t allowed to talk about those things, even with them,” said Dr. Michael Fahey Traver, an Army psychiatrist at Guantánamo in 2013 and 2014. He was assigned to treat only   detainees kept in Camp 7, Guantánamo’s most restricted area, so that he did not inadvertently pass sensitive information to other prisoners. If a detainee raised the subject of his prior treatment, Dr. Traver was to redirect the conversation, he said his predecessor had told him. Among his patients were Ramzi bin   accused of helping plot the Sept. 11 attacks, and Abd     who was charged in the 2000 bombing of the American destroyer Cole and endured some of the C. I. A. ’s most extreme interrogation techniques, including waterboarding. At the request of prosecutors, a military psychiatrist and two military psychologists went to Guantánamo in 2013 to assess Mr. Nashiri’s competency to assist in his defense. The panel concluded that, while competent, he suffered from PTSD and major depression. The military commission trying Mr. Nashiri held a hearing in 2014 on the adequacy of his mental health care. Shortly before the hearing, Dr. Traver removed a previous diagnosis by another Guantánamo psychiatrist that Mr. Nashiri had PTSD. “I didn’t think he met that diagnosis,” Dr. Traver said in an interview. Dr. Sondra Crosby, an expert on torture who consulted for Mr. Nashiri’s defense, disagreed. Dr. Crosby, an internist, said his treatment was inadequate. “He suffers chronic nightmares,” she testified in an affidavit, which “directly relate to the specific physical, emotional and sexual torture inflicted upon Mr.   while in U. S. custody. ” The content of his nightmares, she wrote, was classified. The commission judge, citing a Supreme Court ruling that prisons must provide health care, found insufficient evidence of “deliberate indifference” to his medical needs. What went on after prisoners were summoned for interrogations at Guantánamo was mostly a mystery to the mental health personnel, some of them said. Even when patients returned from sessions “looking terrible,” said Mr. Lakemacher, the former psychiatric technician, “that was not to be addressed. ” (After his deployment, Mr. Lakemacher said, he regretted taking part in what he came to consider the unjust, indefinite detention of prisoners. He later was discharged from the Navy as a conscientious objector.) Some doctors, on their own, shied away from the subject of interrogation tactics. “I didn’t want to get near that stuff,” Dr. Rosecrans said. “Men would say, ‘When I got here, they treated me like a dog,’” or that they were humiliated, she said, but she refrained from inquiring, in part, “to preserve their dignity. ” When detainees claimed to have been tortured or maltreated, “you didn’t know if it was true or not,” she said. “Is it PTSD, or is it delusional disorder?” she said, adding, “I was in such a vacuum. ” But Dr. Rosecrans had little reason to suspect abusive treatment, she said, because some prisoners seemed eager to go to interrogation sessions, which they called “reservations. ” Interrogators, working in trailers separate from the structures where detainees were housed, doled out rewards like snack food or magazines speaking with them broke the boredom for detainees. “It was a way to get out of their cell,” said Ms. Thurman, the nurse practitioner. “They’d do anything, I think, to do something different for the day. ” Dr. Stewart, the Navy captain who treated detainees in 2003 and 2004, said she had never noticed any men in distress after returning from interrogations. But she typically did not ask what had happened there or try to focus on trauma in therapy, she said. “I didn’t want to stir up anything that might make things worse,” she said. PTSD, generally thought to be the most common psychiatric illness resulting from torture, was rarely diagnosed at Guantánamo. Dr. Rosecrans and other doctors who served there said the diagnosis did not matter because they could still treat the symptoms, like depression, anxiety or insomnia. Standard treatment for the disorder involves building trust and revisiting traumatic experiences, which can temporarily exacerbate symptoms. That was impractical at Guantánamo, Dr. Rosecrans and others contended, where detainees were under stress and often unwilling to talk about what had happened to them. “These folks were in acute survival mode,” Dr. Rosecrans said. Most of their concerns were “   or   not  . ” Dr. Davidson said he had not considered doing full histories to diagnose PTSD. But later, he said, after he mulled over the experiences of American soldiers, “the thought was occurring to me: How come our guys get PTSD and they don’t? Well, probably because I’m not asking the right questions. ” Dr. Jonathan Woodson, a former assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, who was the Pentagon’s top health official from 2010 until this spring, said he was unaware that mental health providers at Guantánamo had avoided asking detainees about coercive interrogations. He said his policy was that physicians should not be constrained in what they could ask patients. “You would take the history of someone who is exhibiting symptoms,” he said. “In PTSD, it’s almost automatic. ” Brig. Gen. Stephen N. Xenakis, a retired Army psychiatrist who consulted for the legal defense teams of many detainees, said, “You cannot provide psychological treatment if you never look into what happened to them when they are tortured. ” He added: “The psychologists and psychiatrists at Guantánamo are not meeting the standards of care of the military or the profession. ” Military officials disagree. Capt. John Filostrat, a spokesman for Joint Task Force Guantanamo, said, “We are doing a tough job, and we are doing it well. ” Mental health providers recall troubled men they helped  —   an Afghan farmer who attempted suicide, a psychotic Yemeni man stabilized and removed from isolation, a traumatized Saudi patient who began opening up. Some doctors describe Guantánamo as their most difficult deployment. They were cast in unfamiliar roles: recipients of pleas for privileges, inadvertent disciplinarians ordering “ ” restrictions like the removal of prayer beads or sheets, enablers of policies that made them deeply uncomfortable. “Every day was an ethical challenge, quite frankly,” Dr. Davidson said. Procedures at Guantánamo changed over time. Limits on abusive tactics were tightened by Congress in 2005, then banned by President Obama in 2009. But even after interrogation conditions eased, and after BSCT personnel were denied access to medical records in 2005, many detainees remained distrustful. That made it “a real challenge for the physicians treating them to even determine what was a real problem and what wasn’t,” said Dr. Bruce Meneley, a Navy captain, now retired, who commanded the medical group at Guantánamo from 2007 to 2009. Some men, worried about being seen as weak or crazy, would disclose only physical complaints like stomach aches, headaches and insomnia. Dr. Traver said sleeping pills had been the sole medication that the   detainees he treated would agree to take. The doctors were unfamiliar with the ways psychiatric illness could be expressed in some cultures. A number of prisoners, Dr. Rosecrans recalled, described being plagued by jinns. She and others prescribed powerful   but she remembers wondering, “Are we doing the right thing?” After years of incarceration at a place that became a symbol of American injustice  —   a legal black hole where men often did not know what they were accused of and had few avenues of legal recourse  —   many detainees, seeing themselves as political prisoners, seethed with resentment or were overcome by depression. Over and over, the psychiatrists recalled, men would ask, “Why am I here?” or “What’s my future?”  —   questions the doctors could not answer. Sometimes, they said, their work felt futile. “The environmental factors outweighed so much of what we did,” Dr. Davidson said. “We had so many people who were depressed. Well, I would be really depressed, too, if they stuck me in a place, I had no idea where I was, and I had no idea if or when I was going to leave. That is the definition of depression, I think  —   not having any control over my situation. ” It was often difficult to discern, doctors said, who was genuinely troubled, who was seeking attention and, most worrisome, who was in danger. “All of the leaders that I met were like, ‘No one is dying on my watch,’” Dr. Rosecrans said. In 2004, after men began refusing food to protest their detention, she was asked to devise a protocol for evaluating the mental health of those on prolonged hunger strikes. Dr. Rosecrans believed that mentally competent people had the right to choose not to eat  —   even if that meant they would die. The American Medical Association and international medical organizations endorse that position. But the government has insisted on forced feedings, which are permissible in federal prisons. Detainees have described the procedures used at Guantánamo as particularly painful, with some likening them to torture. Musa’ab   a Yemeni captured in Pakistan and suspected in a terrorism plot, the evidence for which the United States eventually largely disavowed, joined a large group of hunger strikers in 2013 protesting conditions at the prison. He had arrived at Guantánamo in 2002, barely out of his teens, after being held at a C. I. A. prison. He had violent nightmares and other psychiatric problems after harsh treatment there, his medical records show. Over the years, judges threw out his admissions during interrogations, finding they were tainted by mistreatment at the C. I. A. prison and coercive questioning at Guantánamo. But his detention stretched on, and after both of his parents died, Mr. Madhwani said in a letter to a federal judge that he was “utterly hopeless. ” He added: “I have no reason to believe that I will ever leave this prison alive. It feels like death would be a better fate than living in these conditions. ” It was up to the psychiatrists and psychologists to decide how seriously to take such statements, and how to respond to them. “What do you do if they say they’re suicidal?” said Dr. Elspeth Cameron Ritchie, an Army colonel, now retired, and psychiatrist who was dispatched to Guantánamo in late 2002 after a spate of attempts. “Are they really suicidal, or are they manipulating the system?” More than 600 “suicide gestures” had been recorded at Guantánamo by 2009, with more than 40 categorized as suicide attempts, according to a medical article. The doctors had to distinguish genuine attempts  —   reflecting desperation or, as American officials contended, a desire for martyrdom  —   from acts aimed at improving their conditions of confinement. To date, at least six deaths have been have classified as suicides, though critics have raised questions about foul play in some cases. One Guantánamo commander referred to three of them, which were simultaneous, as acts of warfare against America. Several of the dead had been treated by mental health providers for serious disorders. Only 60 prisoners remain at Guantánamo, and about a third of them have been approved for transfer. Ten have been charged with or convicted of crimes by the military commissions system. Capt. Richard Quattrone of the Navy, who served until September as the prison’s chief medical officer, said just a small number of detainees had chronic mental health issues. “The things we see are about    issues, anxiety over their release, and when it will happen, or if it will happen,” he said. “Whatever happened in the past,” he added, “I think we’ve now built trust with the medical personnel. ” Looking back, Dr. Rosecrans said she and her colleagues had faced many obstacles. For certain prisoners, the very tool that psychiatrists and psychologists most rely on  —   asking questions  —   would forever evoke interrogations. And the secrecy complicated everything. “Did we know what was going on? Or what might have been going on?” Dr. Rosecrans asked. “I didn’t know any of that intel stuff. ” But, she added, “we did the job of treating patients. ” Guantánamo stayed with her in unexpected ways. Relaxing on a cruise soon after leaving the prison assignment, she tried to pose her daughter for a photo. When the child refused to put down a stuffed animal, Dr. Rosecrans threatened to throw it overboard. “You’re a little terrorist!” she erupted."
7017,25483,Violence Escalates Between Myanmar Forces and Rohingya - The New York Times,New York Times,Jane Perlez and Wai Moe,2016-11-14,2016.0,11.0,,"SITTWE, Myanmar  —   Violence between the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim population, and Myanmar’s security forces escalated over the weekend as two soldiers were killed by crudely armed attackers, said government officials and Muslim residents. In retaliation, troops of the   government used helicopters to fire at the attackers in dense forest in northwestern Myanmar, a government spokesman said. The two soldiers were killed Saturday by attackers armed with guns, knives and spears near the village of Gwason, south of Maungdaw, the main town in northern Rakhine, said the state information officer, U San Nwe. About 500 attackers were involved in the clash, he said. The area is closed to Western journalists, making it impossible to verify the scale of the fighting. The remote enclave of northern Rakhine State, close to the Bangladeshi border, has been under siege since the government sent security forces to hunt for what it said were armed Rohingya assailants who had killed nine police officers in early October. Since then, human rights groups have received reports of killings of unarmed Rohingya men by Myanmar soldiers, rapes of Rohingya women by soldiers in a number of villages, and beatings of Rohingya men held in detention in the town of Maungdaw. Before the latest attack, as many as 100 Rohingya civilians may have been killed, the groups say. Western diplomats have called on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate who leads Myanmar’s government, to conduct an independent investigation into the violence. So far, she has declined, allowing a Rakhine State committee to investigate. She has also urged that specific complaints be filed with a commission  headed by Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, that was formed in August. Her spokesman, U Zaw Htay, said on Sunday that the latest attacks made it necessary for the military and police operation to continue until the culprits were arrested and the weapons they had seized were found. The troops have been instructed to respect human rights, he said. But Myanmar’s army is known to be poorly trained and has a record rife with human rights abuses, including rape, in its battles with various separatist groups over many years, Western diplomats say. Also on Saturday, a police car was hit by the blast from a roadside mine near the village of Kyikanpyin, north of Maungdaw, where five of the nine police officers were killed on Oct. 9, according to the Ministry of Information in Naypyidaw, the capital. No one was killed in the blast on Saturday. Reached by telephone in Maungdaw on Sunday, Mohammed Sultan, a retired Rohingya teacher, said some students had told him that their villages had been set on fire. “One of my pupils said he was hiding in the rice field,” Mr. Sultan said. The connection then went dead, he said.   satellite images taken in October and this month showed widespread burning of Rohingya villages, Human Rights Watch said on Sunday. Although relations between the Rohingya and the security forces have always been tense, the tactic of Rohingya men attacking police stations, targeting security forces and apparently planting roadside bombs is new, government officials and Rohingya activists say. The motivation for the increase in violence by what appears to be a small group of armed Rohingya men is not clear. The government, providing little proof, immediately blamed two   groups: Aqa Mul Mujahidin and the Rohingya Solidarity Organization. The   repression of the Rohingya by the Myanmar authorities made the population of about one million Rohingya fertile ground for Islamic radicalization, activists and diplomats say. Here in Sittwe, in southern Rakhine, more than 100, 000 Rohingya have been kept in what amount to internment camps for four years, prevented from traveling and forbidden to reclaim land and property destroyed during communal violence in 2012. The new violence north of Sittwe was worse than that four years ago, said Mohamed Saed, a community leader. “Then, it was communal violence between two groups: Rohingya and Rakhine Buddhists,” he said. “This is now direct government repression. ” Several Rohingya leaders said they did not believe Rohingya ties to radical jihadists were the cause of the attacks five weeks ago. New, harsh proposals by the government may have been the catalyst, they suggested. In September, a Rakhine official, Col. Htein Lin, said the government would destroy all “illegally” built structures, including more than 2, 500 houses, 600 shops, a dozen mosques and more than 30 schools. U Kyaw Min, a Rohingya who is the chairman of the Democracy and Human Rights Party, said, “That was saying we have to reduce the population of Rohingya and push them over the border to Bangladesh. ” The attitude of officials in Rakhine State toward the Rohingya is unequivocal. They call the Rohingya “Bengalis,” implying that they belong in Bangladesh. A leader of the Arakan National Party, U Aung Win, said it was now necessary to form a special paramilitary force. The Rohingya make up more than 90 percent of northern Rakinine State’s population, outnumbering the Rakhine Buddhists, so more protection is needed for the Buddhist minority, Mr. Aung Win said. The two groups cannot live together, he insisted. Mr. Aung Win is also the chairman of the Rakhine State investigation into the Oct. 9 attacks. The Rohingya villages around Kyikanpyin have become armed camps, according to telephone conversations and text messages from villagers to friends in Sittwe. Food is scarce, and a strict    curfew is enforced, they say. In those areas, villagers say soldiers have raped women and stolen their jewelry. Three women, ages 23, 21 and 17, were raped Wednesday by soldiers living in the local school, said Mohamed Rahim, a village leader in Pyoung Pai, not far from Kyikanpyin. “The villagers were told to gather in the rice fields, but the three girls were told to stay in the house with their mother,” he said in a telephone interview. “Before the rape, they told the mother to get out. I then saw the military enter the house. ” Myanmar officials deny that rapes have occurred. “It’s not so easy to rape a Bengali woman,” Mr. Aung Win said. “All the Bengali villages are covered by bamboo netting and plastic. ” In a recent interview with the BBC, Mr. Aung Win said it was impossible that soldiers had raped the women because Rohingya “are very dirty. ” The question of the rapes is particularly sensitive. The Myanmar Times newspaper fired a journalist, Fiona MacGregor, for writing an article about alleged rapes of Rohingya women on Oct. 19."
7215,25752,What Are Donald Trump’s Views on Climate Change? Some Clues Emerge - The New York Times,New York Times,Erica Goode,2016-05-26,2016.0,5.0,,"So far, Donald J. Trump has said very little about climate change and energy policy beyond his Twitter posts on the issues. He has called global warming a “hoax,” for example, and claimed that the Chinese fabricated climate change (just a joke, he later said). And in an interview this week with Reuters, he said that he was “not a big fan” of the Paris climate accord, and that “at a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements. ” But more clues about Mr. Trump’s views on environmental issues emerged this week from a   briefing on energy policy prepared for the presumptive Republican nominee by Representative Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota and an early supporter of Mr. Trump. Mr. Cramer, who defines himself as a climate change skeptic, discussed in his briefing paper a variety of government regulations that Mr. Trump might do away with if he were president. They included the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, currently pending in the courts, as well as a federal rule intended to protect waterways and wetlands, and a regulation setting standards for methane emissions that the Environmental Protection Agency completed last week. In an interview, Mr. Cramer said he wrote in the briefing paper that a growing number of Americans wanted action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels. And he outlined a broad energy policy that embraced all types of fuel sources  —   including coal, oil, solar, wind and hydropower  —   that he called an “      energy message. ” Mr. Cramer, from a heavy   and   state, said it was important that any policy does not “punish coal” or other fossil fuels. Mr. Trump may soon share more of his views. His press secretary, Hope Hicks, said that the campaign “will have more to say on the topic soon. ” He is scheduled to speak at an oil conference in North Dakota on Thursday. Whenever Mr. Trump does fill in more details on the topic, he will have eager audiences both inside and outside his political party. Republican leaders worry that Mr. Trump’s views, his   Twitter messages notwithstanding, could end up somewhere left of the party’s mainstream. “I think there is concern about where he stands because he hasn’t come out strongly one way or another,” said a Republican aide who insisted on anonymity because she was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Environmental groups, for their part, have seized on each new scrap of information to warn of disastrous consequences should Mr. Trump be elected. “Trump and Cramer are two peas in the climate denial pod, who would make reckless attacks on the progress we have made in the fight against climate change,” Seth Stein, a spokesman for the League of Conservation Voters, said in response to news reports Thursday afternoon about Mr. Cramer’s briefing paper. If Mr. Trump were to acknowledge the reality of climate change, that might provide some Republican politicians with political cover to do so as well. Since 2010, when a Republican member of Congress, Bob Inglis, lost his   bid after saying he would favor a carbon tax, many in the party have regarded any mention of climate change as the equivalent of political suicide. (Mr. Inglis has since focused on persuading conservatives to be “less averse” to addressing climate change, and started a nonprofit group, the Enterprise and Energy Initiative, focusing on conservative responses to the problem.) Yet polls have repeatedly found that a majority of Republican voters, particularly young ones, believe that climate change is real and that the government should take action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale program on Climate Change Communication, said that a nationally representative survey of 1, 004 registered voters, conducted in March in conjunction with George Mason University, found that 56 percent of Trump voters agreed that climate change was occurring. Just over half of them, however, thought those changes were caused by natural changes in the environment, rather than the result of   emissions. The number of Americans over all who say climate change is real has risen to 73 percent from 66 percent two years ago, according to the   Mason poll. But the jump among those who believe in global warming was steepest among Republicans, with a 16 percent increase in two years among all Republicans, and a 19 percent increase among conservative Republicans. Jay Faison, a North Carolina businessman who describes himself as a conservative Republican, said that denying climate change was “the No. 1   issue” that could pull voters away from supporting a candidate, according to research conducted by ClearPath, the organization he founded to promote clean energy and climate change policies that could appeal to conservatives. Mr. Faison, who has said he will devote $10 million to persuading Republican candidates to address climate change, said that a platform that emphasized clean energy solutions could make a difference of 1 or even 2 percent in close elections  —   “which decides a whole lot of elections. ” Like many on both sides of the political aisle, Mr. Faison said he had no idea what Mr. Trump’s views on climate change might be. But he noted that the candidate once said in an interview that he believed in “immaculate air. ” “If you believe in air pollution, then perhaps we could get to the same place,” Mr. Faison said. “If we have cleaner energy solutions and it brings more energy independence, more jobs and lower air pollution, then we would do these things even if we don’t agree with scientists on climate change. ” It is a view that echoes those expressed by Mr. Cramer, who in the past has said he would support a small carbon tax if the revenue went to research on clean fuel technologies. “There is no downside in reducing emissions from fuel,” said Mr. Cramer, who added that “the climate is clearly changing,” but that he was skeptical about how much humans were contributing to the change and about the regulatory solutions offered by Democrats. Climate change has long been far down on the list of issues that voters say are important to them. (Developing clean energy was ranked No. 21 of 23 issues by Trump supporters in the   Mason survey). But Jerry Taylor, the president of the Niskanen Center in Washington, a libertarian think tank, said that the importance of issues in voters’ minds might change during an electoral campaign if a candidate talked about them repeatedly. Mr. Taylor said that if Mr. Trump continued to deny the existence of climate change, Hillary Clinton could use that to claim that Republicans were   and out of touch with reality. “Climate contributes significantly to the poor branding of the Republican Party,” he said, adding that just because an issue was a low priority to voters “doesn’t mean it can’t be used to devastating effect against you. ”"
7384,25975,Pigeons Resist Misguided Leaders - The New York Times,New York Times,James Gorman,2016-09-27,2016.0,9.0,,"When the leader of a flock goes the wrong way, what will the flock do? With human beings, nobody can be sure. But with homing pigeons, the answer is that they find their way home anyway. Either the lead pigeon recognizes that it has no clue and falls back into the flock, letting birds that know where they are going take over, or the flock collectively decides that the direction that it is taking just doesn’t feel right, and it doesn’t follow. Several European scientists report these findings in a stirring report in Biology Letters titled, “Misinformed Leaders Lose Influence Over Pigeon Flocks. ” Isobel Watts, a doctoral student in zoology at Oxford, conducted the study with her advisers, Theresa Burt de Perera and Dora Biro, and with the participation of Mate Nagy, a statistical physicist from Hungary, who is affiliated with several institutions, including Oxford and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Dr. Biro, who studies social behavior in primates as well as pigeons, said that the common questions that ran through her work were “about group living and what types of challenges and opportunities it brings. ” She and her colleagues at Oxford have pioneered a method of studying flock behavior that uses    GPS units, which the birds wear in   backpacks. The devices record a detailed position for each bird a number of times a second. Researchers in Budapest and Oxford developed software to analyze small movements and responses of every bird in a flock. With this method, the scientists can identify which pigeons are leading the way. They can build a picture of how each bird responds to changes in the flight of other birds. The consistent leaders were often fast fliers and occupied the first position in the group of flying birds. Other birds followed them. But what if one day, a leader flew in the wrong direction? The researchers arranged to feed the leaders misinformation by putting them in lofts with artificial light for a few days. By shifting when the lights went on and off, compared with the actual external schedule of light and dark, the researchers could shift the pigeons’ internal clocks a few hours forward or back. Pigeons navigate by using the position of the sun and an internal clock, so the change in the clock threw off their sense of direction and they didn’t fly toward home at all. But the pigeon flock corrected its flight path, and went the right way. Dr. Biro doesn’t know exactly how they corrected. The followers all had the right information, so they might have collectively said, “this guy’s wrong, let’s not follow him,” Dr. Biro said. “Or, the leader said, ‘Something’s wrong here,’” and fell back into the flock, “effectively choosing not to lead,” Dr. Biro said, and another pigeon, that knew the time of day, led the way. Sadly, these kinds of decisions by pigeon flocks offer no reassurance to humans who think political leaders are misinformed or misdirected. The pigeons don’t communicate directly about where they are flying. The flock changes its flight path because of   reactions to position changes by other birds. There’s no   process remotely similar to, say, an election. But knowledge of how the pigeons work might be useful in creating swarms of small robots for activities like search and rescue. If researchers can reduce the   process of a flock to a few simple rules about who follows whom, and when, those rules might be applied to robot groups. Then the group of robots might be able to make some of its own decisions, at least about where to go or how to get there."
7406,26002,"Coke and Pepsi Give Millions to Public Health, Then Lobby Against It - The New York Times",New York Times,Anahad O’Connor,2016-10-11,2016.0,10.0,,"The beverage giants   and PepsiCo have given millions of dollars to nearly 100 prominent health groups in recent years, while simultaneously spending millions to defeat public health legislation that would reduce Americans’ soda intake, according to public health researchers. The findings, published on Monday in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, document the beverage industry’s deep financial ties to the health community over the past five years, as part of a strategy to silence health critics and gain unlikely allies against soda regulations. The study’s authors, Michael Siegel, a professor at the Boston University school of public health, and Daniel Aaron, a student at Boston University’s medical school, scoured public records including news releases, newspaper databases, lobbying reports, the medical literature and information released by the beverage giants themselves. While some of the incidents cited in the study already have been reported by news organizations, the medical journal report is the first to take a comprehensive look at the industry’s strategy of donating to health organizations while at the same time lobbying against public health measures. The study tracked industry donations and lobbying spending from 2011 through 2015, at a time when many cities were mulling soda taxes or other regulations to combat obesity. “We wanted to look at what these companies really stand for,” said Mr. Aaron, the study’s  . “And it looks like they are not helping public health at all  —   in fact they’re opposing it almost across the board, which calls these sponsorships into question. ” Mr. Aaron said that the industry donations created “  conflicts of interest” for the health groups that accepted them. The report found a number of instances in which influential health groups accepted beverage industry donations and then backed away from supporting soda taxes or remained noticeably silent about the initiatives. In one instance cited in the study, the nonprofit group Save the Children, which had actively supported soda tax campaigns in several states, did an about face and withdrew its support in 2010. The group had accepted a $5 million grant from Pepsi and was seeking a major grant from Coke to help pay for its health and education programs for children. Responding to the new research, Save the Children said, in a statement, that the group in 2010 had decided to focus on early childhood education, and that its decision to stop supporting soda taxes “was unrelated to any corporate support that Save the Children received. ” When New York proposed a ban on   sodas in 2012, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics cited “conflicting research” and didn’t support the effort. The academy accepted $525, 000 in donations from Coke in 2012. The following year it took a $350, 000 donation from the company. The academy said it no longer has a sponsorship relationship with the beverage firms. The N. A. A. C. P. and the Hispanic Federation have publicly opposed   initiatives despite disproportionately high rates of obesity in black and Hispanic communities. Coke made more than $1 million in donations to the N. A. A. C. P. between 2010 and 2015, and more than $600, 000 to the Hispanic Federation between 2012 and 2015. The groups did not respond to requests for comment. “The beverage industry is using corporate philanthropy to undermine public health measures,” said Kelly D. Brownell, dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke, who was not involved in the new research. The American Diabetes Association accepted $140, 000 from the company between 2012 and 2014. The American Heart Association received more than $400, 000 from Coke between 2010 and 2015. And the National Institutes of Health received nearly $2 million from Coke between 2010 and 2014. In a statement, the heart association said the group is “leading efforts to reduce consumption of sugary drinks,” and the group has advocated for increased taxes on sugary drinks. “To achieve our goals, we must engage a wide variety of food and beverage companies to be part of the solution,” the statement said. The soda sponsorship does not have “ any influence on our science and the public policy positions we advocate for. ” Coke referred questions about the study to their trade group, the American Beverage Association. “We believe our actions in communities and the marketplace are contributing to addressing the complex challenge of obesity,” the beverage association said. “We stand strongly for our need, and right, to partner with organizations that strengthen our communities. ” The beverage association said it disagreed with public health advocates “on discriminatory and regressive taxes and policies on our products. ” In a statement PepsiCo said it is “incorrectly painted as a ‘soda company,’ when only a quarter of our global revenue comes from carbonated soft drinks. ” “We believe that obesity is a complex, multifaceted issue and that our company has an important role to play in addressing it   which includes engaging with public health organizations and responding to consumers’ demand for healthier products,” the statement said. The New York Times last year reported that Coke had paid for scientific research that downplayed the link between sugary drinks and obesity. After that article was published, the beverage giant released a database showing that since 2010 it had spent more than $120 million on academic research and partnerships with health organizations involved in curbing obesity. From 2011 to 2015, Coke spent on average more than $6 million per year lobbying against public health measures aimed at curbing soda consumption, according to data from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Pepsi spent about $3 million per year during that period, and the American Beverage Association spent more than $1 million each year, the study found. In 2009 alone, when the government proposed a federal soda tax to curb obesity that would help finance health care reform, Coke, Pepsi and the American Beverage Association spent a combined $38 million lobbying against the measure, which ultimately failed. When the mayor of Philadelphia proposed a soda tax in 2010, the beverage industry offered $10 million to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia if the tax proposal was dropped. The City Council voted down the measure, and the beverage association later made the donation. Philadelphia did ultimately impose a soda tax this year. The beverage industry filed a lawsuit in September, calling the tax illegal. The industry also is spending millions on advertising campaigns against soda taxes that are on the ballot in at least four cities this November  —   three in Northern California, and one in Boulder, Colo. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, said the paper shows that soda companies “want to have it both ways  —   appear as socially responsible corporate citizens and lobby against public health measures every chance they get. ”"
7485,26112,Donald Trump Is Said to Intend to Keep a Stake in His Business - The New York Times,New York Times,Maggie Haberman and Jo Becker,2016-12-08,2016.0,12.0,,"  Donald J. Trump is considering formally turning over the operational responsibility for his real estate company to his two adult sons, but he intends to keep a stake in the business and resist calls to divest, according to several people briefed on the discussions. Under a plan now being considered by the Trump family and its lawyers, Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump’s elder daughter, would also take a leave of absence from the Trump Organization, in the surest sign that she is exploring a potential move to Washington with her husband, Jared Kushner. Mr. Kushner is discussing an   undetermined role advising his    and Ms. Trump plans on being an advocate on issues in which she has a personal interest, like child care. Before deciding how to separate from her father’s business, Ms. Trump is also assessing how to disentangle from her apparel and licensing brands, which are named for her, two people briefed on her plans said. She plans on appointing a president of her company to run the    operations. The Trumps are exploring what was described by one person briefed on the discussions as a “legal structure” that would give Mr. Trump and his daughter separation from the company. The New York Times spoke to two people involved in the transition process who were granted anonymity to speak candidly about continuing negotiations. None of the plans have been completed, and it remains uncertain precisely what the   will reveal next week at an expected news conference at which he has said he will discuss “leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country. ” Aides to Ms. Trump and to Mr. Trump’s transition team declined to comment. In announcing on Twitter last week that he would hold a news conference, Mr. Trump acknowledged that leaving his business was “visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses. ” Still, the Trump family is facing enormous external pressure to do as much as it can to ensure a bright line between the  ’s business brand and his role leading the country. And any arrangement in which Mr. Trump derives a financial interest in his business could add to criticism about potential conflicts that could arise from the Trump Organization’s global ties. The Office of Government Ethics has told Mr. Trump’s lawyers that only a divestiture would resolve ethical concerns, guidance that was made public in an extraordinary stream of posts on the office’s Twitter feed. Officials with the office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the plan under consideration. The federal law that prevents federal employees from making decisions involving their financial interests exempts the president and vice president, though no recent sitting president has maintained foreign financial holdings as extensive as Mr. Trump’s. At a meeting with The Times last month, Mr. Trump pointed out the absence of laws governing conflicts of interest for a sitting president. “The law’s totally on my side, the president can’t have a conflict of interest,” Mr. Trump said, defending his decision to remain attached to his business, even with a loosened grip. He said then that he preferred to turn it over to his children, with his elder daughter taking the lead. Some on the transition team have privately expressed concern over how foreign and domestic interests could seek to curry influence with the president by doing business with his adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, that ultimately accrues to Mr. Trump’s financial benefit. At least part of Mr. Trump’s reluctance to sell off his holdings stems from tax liability concerns, according to a person briefed on the plan. Government officials can defer capital gains taxes on assets they sell to avoid conflicts, providing they reinvest the money in government securities or certain approved mutual funds. But the bill comes due if those assets are sold after a person leaves office. Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, who grew up in their father’s business and are currently executive vice presidents, have told people that complaints about appearances of impropriety could be a continuing distraction for their father as he puts together his administration. Jan W. Baran, a leading Republican ethics lawyer, said that even though the law was clearly on Mr. Trump’s side, there were no easy answers on what he should do about his financial holdings. If he keeps a stake in his company, persistent questions about whether he is acting in the country’s interest or his business interest will be “unavoidable,” Mr. Baran said. On the other hand, Mr. Baran said, if Mr. Trump decides to divest, that raises other questions. “Who are you going sell it to?” he said. “Does selling his stake eliminate the ethical issues, or does it compound them?” There will also be lingering questions related to Mr. Trump’s children, depending on the structure the family settles on for running the company, Mr. Baran added. As outlined, the plan could leave in place many of the potential conflicts of interest growing out of a real estate and licensing business that spans at least 20 nations, in places like India, Indonesia and Turkey. Richard W. Painter, who served as the chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007, and who is planning to police the Trump administration in a role with the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, noted that the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution prohibits government officials from accepting gifts and payments from foreign governments or corporations controlled by foreign governments. Investments or loans from foreign   financial institutions, even diplomats staying at or hosting events at Trump hotel properties, could run afoul of that clause, Mr. Painter said. Mr. Trump will also have to take care to ensure that concessions that benefit his company are not construed as a bribe intended to influence official action. Mr. Painter said that even setting aside the legal questions, everything Mr. Trump does will be filtered through the lens of how he stands to benefit financially. “There are ways to make it work legally, but the appearances are going to be terrible and it’s going to be a   ethical challenge,” Mr. Painter said. Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and both Mr. Bush and his father held their assets in blind trusts while in office. President Obama did not use one, but he had minimal investments and they were unlikely to pose direct conflicts. His wife, Michelle Obama, gave up her professional responsibilities before he took office. While it is unclear what structure Mr. Trump proposes to set up to wall himself off from   the continuing involvement of two of his children in the business would complicate matters. And for a trust to be truly blind, experts say that the assets would have to be liquidated  —   and that Mr. Trump, who will be the wealthiest president in American history, would have to have no knowledge of how the proceeds were invested."
7678,26368,Climate Change Conversations Are Targeted in Questionnaire to Energy Department - The New York Times,New York Times,Coral Davenport,2017-04-14,2017.0,4.0,,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump’s transition team has circulated an unusual   questionnaire at the Department of Energy that requests the names of all employees and contractors who have attended climate change policy conferences, as well as emails and documents associated with the conferences. In question after question, the document peppers Energy Department managers with pointed queries about climate science research, clean energy programs and the employees who work for those programs. More broadly, the questionnaire hints at a significant shift of emphasis at the agency toward nuclear power, and a push to commercialize the research of the Energy Department’s laboratories, long considered the crown jewels of federal science. Energy Department employees, who shared the questionnaire with The New York Times and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, described the questionnaire as worrying. Mr. Trump has just tapped Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma and a climate change denialist, to head the Environmental Protection Agency, and the   has made it clear he intends to roll back eight years of regulatory efforts by President Obama that aimed to control   emissions. The questionnaire “suggests the Trump administration plans a witch hunt for civil servants who’ve simply been doing their jobs,” Robert Weissman, president of the watchdog group Public Citizen, said in a statement. “Democrats and Republicans alike should unite to condemn any action that intimidates, threatens or retaliates against civil servants for lawfully doing their jobs. ” Michael McKenna, a former Energy Department official in George W. Bush’s administration who initially led Mr. Trump’s Energy Department transition, saw nothing amiss. “If meetings happened and important stuff was decided, voters have a right to know,” said Mr. McKenna, who stepped down after Mr. Trump banned working lobbyists from the transition. “It’s not a matter of national security. The transition is not asking about nuclear weapons. They are asking about meetings about modeling for God’s sake. ” The questionnaire requests “a list of all Department of Energy employees or contractors who have attended any Interagency Working Group meetings” to design a measurement known as the Social Cost of Carbon, a figure used by the Obama administration to measure the economic effects of carbon dioxide pollution, and to justify the economic cost of climate regulations. That question goes on to demand “a list of when those meetings were” as well as “emails associated with those meetings. ” A separate question asks for “a list of Department employees or contractors who attended any” United Nations climate change conference “in the last five years. ” Still another inquires about which office led the department’s efforts to complete the   nuclear weapons deal with Iran. Even the Energy Information Administration, the department’s independent statistics office, was not immune. The questionnaire demands justification for the office’s measurements of the nation’s carbon dioxide pollution. “In the Annual Energy Outlook 2016, E. I. A. assumed that the Clean Power Plan should be in the reference case despite the fact that the reference case is based on existing laws and regulations,” the questionnaire reads. “Why did the E. I. A. make that assumption, which seems to be atypical of past forecasts?” Several other questions focus on the national scientific laboratories, including queries on highest salaries, outside evaluation of research and commercialization programs for their research. It is not clear whether similar questionnaires were circulated at other cabinet agencies, or whether the questionnaire was the product of a particularly zealous landing team at the Energy Department. Press officers at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department, the main agencies responsible for implementing climate policy, said those agencies had not received questionnaires. The Trump transition office did not respond to requests for comment. But former Energy Department employees and presidential transition officials said that while it is normal for presidential transition teams to ask policy questions, it is highly unusual to send out questionnaires. The requests for lists of specific employees involved in shaping climate policy is irregular and alarming, they said, given that on the campaign trail Mr. Trump clearly showed his skepticism of climate change science and his hostility to climate change policy. “A lot of these questions make perfect sense,” said Jonathan Levy, a former deputy chief of staff of the Energy Department in the Obama administration. “They have to get their heads around what responsibilities they will have and don’t have. The thing that’s unsettling are the questions that appear to be targeting personnel for doing public service. ” John Podesta, a former White House chief of staff who led Mr. Obama’s transition, wrote in an email, “To the best of my knowledge, no one in the ’08 transition asked questions about meeting attendance. ” Max Stier, an expert on presidential transitions and the president of Partnership for Public Service, a research organization, said: “The new president will come in with new policies that he’ll pursue, but that’s different from identifying civil servants who are responsible for following through on policies set by the previous political leadership. And they’re not going to be effective without working well with the career team. ” Mr. McKenna said Energy Department employees had nothing to fear. “The career staff at D. O. E. is great. There’s not a soul in the world who wants to do any harm to those guys. ” Beyond the targeted questions about climate change, the questionnaire also appears to offer a broad map of the Trump administration’s policy goals for the Energy Department. Several questions signal an intent to downsize the department, including queries about existing vacancies and the number of assistant energy secretaries that are mandated by law. One question requests recommendations to implement a 10 percent budget reduction over the next four years. The questionnaire also suggests a new emphasis on nuclear power, including queries about supporting the operation of existing nuclear reactors preventing the premature closing of nuclear plants increasing research and development of advanced nuclear reactors and moving forward with plans to license nuclear waste disposal at Nevada’s Yucca Mountain, which was shut down by the Obama administration. One question touches on the department’s support for “offshore wind,” a particular interest for Mr. Trump, who is fighting wind turbines off the coast of one of his golf courses in Scotland. The Energy Department’s national laboratories are largely focused on   scientific research, but several questions seem to indicate an interest in pushing the research in a commercial direction, including a request to the labs for a list of licensing agreements and royalty proceeds over the last five years. In the immediate   War years, the Clinton administration pushed the labs to partner with private companies on commercial research, but the Bush administration saw those efforts as government intervention in the free market.   Trump has shown no concern for such intervention."
8219,26955,Tancredo: Three Lessons Learned from the Judicial Brawl over Trump’s Immigration Order - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tom Tancredo,2017-02-11,2017.0,2.0,,"Lesson number one: never take a knife to a gun fight. Lesson number two is that every Trump initiative on immigration will be a gunfight, not a walk in the park. And, unfortunately, lesson number three is that there are a large number of “  judges” who will be strapped and ready to bushwhack the president at every turn. [The federal courts are a battleground, not a playground, and the 9th Circuit is the most   battleground of all. District Court Judge Robart was especially incompetent in his ruling and deserved to be ridiculed for his embarrassing performance, but judicial sabotage of constitutional government is nothing new. Someone at the White House or Homeland Security forgot to factor it into the game plan for the “ . ”  Score round one for the army of activist open borders judges and lawyers Trump will face at every turn. But that 9th Circuit ruling was only round one, and Trump can still score a knockout. As legal critic J. V. DeLong observed in a February 10 commentary in FORBES, “The Ninth Circuit opinion upholding the lower court’s     decision is hard to defend, as a matter of either legal reasoning or common sense. ” So, the good news is, the law is on Trump’s side, and even honest liberals understand that. The bad news is, that’s often not enough. But Trump has a    weapon: the public wants that executive order implemented. Trump may have erred in his choice of words in calling Judge Robart a “  judge. ” Okay, he is a real judge: he was duly appointed and sworn into that district court position. But, hey, let’s be honest here: Trump is not the first president to attack or ridicule a federal judge. We all remember Barack Obama criticizing and insulting Chief Justice John Roberts and the entire US Supreme Court to their face in one of his State of the Union speeches. President Franklin Roosevelt was so angry at a string of Supreme Court decisions that he asked Congress to “pack” the court by adding two new members —   two new members he would appoint. President Trump has not yet suggested anything so blatantly political as packing the court. What he has suggested is viewed as even more radical by our progressive media: that judges interpret and apply the law as it is written, not subvert it with their personal political views. It is abundantly clear that is exactly what the 9th Circuit has done —   or attempted to do. But the White House need not and will not let that unfounded 9th Circuit ruling go unchallenged. President Trump’s January 27 executive order instituting a   freeze on refugee and alien admissions from seven   countries  —   among other needed reforms like returning our refugee admissions ceiling to 50, 000 annually from Obama’s recent doubling of that number —   obviously did not anticipate the virulent, hysterical reaction by opponents and the feeding frenzy by the media. But nonetheless, politics and media hysteria aside, his executive order is rooted in the constitutional powers of the president and existing immigration law. Shame on the critics for their deplorable lies and obfuscations shame on the major media for agitating and abetting the misinformed hysteria and shame on the 9th Circuit for its attempted political subversion of the law. Such is the world we now live in, where a fully lawful order of the president is met with organized and orchestrated chaos. And yet, there is more than a silver lining behind these menacing clouds: Trump has both the law and the American people on his side. Yes, there were snafus and mistakes in the first 48 hours of implementation, and indeed, legal “green card” immigrants who are already   residents of the United States should not have been affected by the travel ban. Those temporary problems were quickly corrected but were magnified all out of proportion by a partisan media anxious and even gleeful in their rush to embarrass the president to the maximum. However, when the dust settles, it remains true that nothing has happened to question the policy or the legality of the executive order. One other regrettable byproduct of the   hysteria over the “travel ban” is that the public spotlight was diverted from the equally important executive order signed by Trump two days earlier on interior immigration enforcement. That executive order aiming to end “sanctuary cities” and other unlawful obstructions to immigration law enforcement has not yet been challenged in federal court, but sooner or later, it will be. Why? Because the left thinks they own the courts —   they can always find an activist district court judge to agree with their noxious views. There are two answers to the rising plague of lawsuits by progressives seeking to use activist judges to rewrite our Constitution. First, Trump will appoint replacement judges who revere the Constitution above leftist ideology. The second answer is to dethrone the courts as the “last word” on the Constitution. The truth is, the Constitution established three   branches of government, not judicial supremacy. Where do you suppose did THAT curious doctrine came from? A court decision, of course."
8312,27048,Ann Coulter: Trump Should Withdraw Funding from Any School with Speech Codes,Breitbart,John Hayward,2017-02-03,2017.0,2.0,,"In an interview broadcast Friday on Breitbart News Daily, author Ann Coulter talked about the violent demonstrations   have employed to shut down speech they dislike, notably Milo Yiannopoulos of Breitbart News at UC Berkeley this week. [SiriusXM host Alex Marlow contended that the mainstream media’s irresponsible use of terms like “fascist” and “white nationalist” for speakers who are not of the Left has laid the groundwork for violence against them.  “It is the rise of a genuinely violent fascist movement,” Coulter said of these   gangs. “It would be as if the Nazis went around complaining about how the Jews were attacking them and oppressing them. That’s basically what we have going on now. ” She recalled how violent protesters shut down a Trump rally in Chicago during the 2016 presidential campaign. “It was amazing to me how many families with kids, and wives, and daughters, they continued to go out to see Trump. It is like my college speeches, something I’ve been doing for a long time. You know, you’ll have 20 speeches that are fine, and then suddenly, BAM! the violent mobs show up. You never know when it’s going to happen, so you have to be prepared all the time,” she said. “But Americans still did come out. I think that was intended to reduce Trump’s crowds, and make it look like he was the one creating the violence. All of this, just for someone who says, ‘We have to take care of Americans first.’ That’s what they’re so upset about, Alex,” Coulter declared, returning to an earlier point about how the U. S. Congress is attempting to cut back on the cost of major programs for Americans, such as Social Security and Medicare, at the same time   advocates insist on importing even more dependents. “We can’t afford that. We can’t afford this. We have to raise the retirement age. No, stop! We gave at the office!” she exclaimed. Coulter agreed wholeheartedly with President Trump’s threat to “withdraw all federal funding from Berkeley” if the college administration refuses to deal with violence. “This is a genuine threat to democracy when people can’t engage in the first of the Bill of Rights, the very first one that’s mentioned: freedom of speech,” she warned. “This has been a burgeoning movement, particularly on our college campuses, for a long time. ”  “In a calm, reflective moment, I think he should do the same thing with any colleges that have speech codes or need special ‘free speech zones’ where students   professors are disciplined for engaging in First Amendment speech,” she advised.  “This has absolutely been done before,” she noted. “The IRS has been used to say, ‘Sorry. If you’re collecting student aid, you can’t attend these colleges. We’re not sending any student aid to these colleges who don’t abide by  …    ’  —   and those were often kind of silly ‘principles’ being enforced, like Bob Jones University, that’s sort of a very hardcore fundamentalist Christian college. I’m a Christian. It has some beliefs  —   or it used to I don’t know if they still do  —   but one was from the Tower of Babel. They wouldn’t allow interracial dating. ”  “They had blacks, they had whites, and it was mostly a    country back then  —   in fact, scholarships for black students  —   but whites couldn’t date black students. Blacks couldn’t date white students,” she explained. “And I ought to add, because I looked this up at the time, there was very little dating of any sort. If you went on a date at Bob Jones, you had to have a chaperone with you. Anyway, there was no racial animus to this it hit both races equally. ”  “But for that, the IRS came down like a ton of bricks on Bob Jones University. No federal aid through student scholarships, as I recall. A student who had student aid could not attend that college. And now, we have a genuine fascist, violent fascist, movement rising up, and there’s not only no punishment, but taxpayers are paying for this? Oh, no, no, no. Second to immigration, the next biggest problem in this country is the universities and public schools,” she said. Coulter said this climate of hatred and violent repression of dissent comes from the university administrations.  “These are not spontaneous movements,” she scoffed. “I described in my book Demonic on groupthink and mob behavior, that these are particularly lickspittle students that want to please the professor. And they know damned well their professors are opposed to everything Ann Coulter says and everything Milo says. It’s just like presenting a polished apple to the teacher. ‘Oh, teacher, here: I brought you a gift today! I went and protested Ann Coulter! ’” “At the risk of being snobbish, but telling you what the truth is, it doesn’t tend to happen at the Ivy League schools,” she observed. “Berkeley is weird.   …     The worst ones are the Jesuit colleges and the community colleges. I mean, at Harvard and Yale  —   and I’ve spoken at both places many times  —   Wellesley, Smith, my own alma mater Cornell, the kids are too  —   they want to challenge you intellectually. They’d be embarrassed to throw something. ”  “Though I do think there is a new movement kind of sweeping through here,” she added, “at some of these schools, we’d be organized. We’d be ready to go. I’d give the speech. They could stand up at the mics. I’d take questions until they had collapsed from exhaustion. And usually at the tougher schools to get into, that’s how they want to be. They want to ask you a question and outsmart you. It’s when it is a    who doesn’t have the power of speech or logic, and just throws food  —   so it would tend to be the lesser colleges. ”  “The other thing is, when we would be prepared and have college Republicans and large men prepared to throw out any hecklers, sometimes the members of the administration would stop people  —   our people, who had rented the room had paid for me to come speak. Someone comes to disrupt and start heckling, they try to remove the heckler, and an administrator  —   this happened at Syracuse University  —   some dean of students stepped forward and said, ‘You can’t remove the heckler because you’re interfering with his free speech rights! ’” Coulter said with astonishment.

8316,27052,"Virginia Refuses to Track Refugee TB, State’s High Rate of Foreign-Born Cases Climbs - Breitbart",Breitbart,Michael Patrick Leahy,2017-01-05,2017.0,1.0,,"The state of Virginia refuses to track the number of refugees it resettles who are diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB). [This refusal continues even as the number of cases diagnosed in the state has increased for two consecutive years, from 180 in 2013  —    the year former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe, a staunch Clinton ally, was elected governor  —   to 198 in 2014, the year he took office, to 212 in 2015, the last year for which data is available.  The percentage of   cases of TB in Virginia has increased from 74 percent in 2013 (147 out of 180) to 79 percent in 2015 (168 out of 212) well above the national average of 66 percent in 2015 (6, 350 out of 9, 536). In the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) Reported Tuberculosis in the United States, 2015, those 6, 350   cases of TB were broken down into the following categories of immigration status upon arrival: But the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) does not think it should be a priority to track   TB cases by category, as do 44 states who have provided the CDC with that data since 2012 (Tennessee became the 45th state to do so in 2014) in its annual Report on Tuberculosis in the United States. “The Virginia Department of Health does not collect the data you have requested,” a spokesperson for VDH responded when Breitbart asked to know the immigration status upon first entry of the 168   residents of Virginia diagnosed with active TB in 2015. “When the revised Report of Verified Case of Tuberculosis was adopted in 2009, the additional variables regarding immigration status were not required by CDC to be collected. The Virginia Department of Health TB program did not consider this information a priority for surveillance, since it already collected country of origin and arrival date for foreign born people,” the spokesperson responded when Breitbart asked why Virginia fails to provide the data 45 other states do to the CDC. “We collect surveillance data to track tuberculosis in Virginia and to prioritize our prevention efforts. All refugees and B1 immigrants are evaluated for TB when they enter the country and if they have disease they will be treated. Prompt treatment for active disease is the primary intervention public health has to control tuberculosis,” the spokesperson answered when asked why Virginia does not consider the information a priority for surveillance, though 45 other states and the CDC do, adding: As you can see from the national data available not very many refugees are diagnosed with tuberculosis once they get here. In Virginia, the number would be insignificant and it would not contribute to planning or thinking about prevention efforts, therefore collecting that information was not a priority for surveillance. Every state has different populations and different approaches to data collection within a general framework provided by the CDC. As a result each state and indeed even at the county and city level the focus will be based on what the risks are among the population in that location. (emphasis added) The spokesperson did not respond when Breitbart asked for evidence to support the assertion that “ not very many refugees are diagnosed with tuberculosis once they get here. ” The overwhelming evidence presented in numerous medical reports shows exactly the opposite —  the per capita rate of active TB among refugees is much higher than the per capita rate in the general population, and by an order of magnitude. The rate of TB among the general population was 3. 0 per 100, 000 in 2015. In contrast, the estimated rate of TB among refugees nationally exceeded 20 cases per 100, 000 refugees that same year (409 cases diagnosed in 45 reporting states where an estimated two million refugees reside). In states where   cases of TB are significantly above the national average, like Virginia, the estimated rate of TB among refugees is even higher. McAuliffe has been a   advocate of open borders and refugees. In November 2015 he very publicly refused to ask the Obama administration to halt the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the state. “Gov. Terry McAuliffe said Tuesday that he would veto any attempt by the General Assembly to block Syrian refugees from coming to the state, dismissing the idea as ‘political posturing’ ” Richmond. com reported at the time. The number of Syrian refugees resettled in the state by the Obama administration increased significantly after that statement, from 21 in the three years between FY 2013 and FY 2015, to 196 in FY 2016, according to the Department of State’s interactive website.   Syrian refugees have been resettled in Virginia in the first three months of FY 2017. Virginia’s problem with   TB began before McAuliffe was elected governor in 2013. In 2002, for instance,   TB cases were only 60 percent of all TB cases in  the state. Since then, a total of 19, 213 refugees have been resettled in the state, according to the Department of State’s interactive website. In 2007, an influx of refugees from high TB burden countries like Bhutan and Burma began. In the four years between FY 2003 and FY 2006, 117 refugees were resettled in Virginia from Burma. In the four subsequent years, FY 2007 to FY 2010, 969 refugees were resettled from Burma. In the five years between FY 2003 and FY 2007, no refugees were resettled in Virginia from Bhutan. In the five subsequent years, FY 2008 to FY 2012, 2, 233 refugees were resettled from Bhutan. Virginia does, however, track country of origin for   TB cases. In 2015, 23 of Virginia’s 168   cases of TB were from the Philippines, 17 were from Viet Nam, 17 were from India, seven were from Haiti, five were from Mexico, one was from China, and 98 were from “all other” 136 countries. Very few of the 69, 933 refugees resettled in the United States in FY 2015 arrived from the Philippines, Viet Nam, India, Haiti, Mexico, or China. The vast majority —  99 percent, or 69, 843 out of 69, 933 —  arrived from the 136 countries in the “all other” category. (69, 843 out of 69, 933). In FY 2016, 99 percent of the refugees resettled in the United States (84, 878 out of 84, 995) arrived from the 136 countries in the “all other” category, according to the Department of State."

[Malachi Hemphill was streaming on the   site, showing his friends a gun that was in his possession. It was unloaded, so one of the viewers asked why there was no magazine in it. After loading the gun following instruction from his viewers, he accidentally shot himself.  “I heard a big boom. I couldn’t tell if it was a gunshot or what,” Shaniqua Stephens, his mother, told 11 Alive Atlanta. She had just watched her son take out the trash when she heard the noise. Running upstairs with her daughter, they found him “laying there in a pool of blood. ” “My daughter screamed and said. ‘Mom turn his phone off!’ As I proceeded to look at his phone he was on Instagram Live,” Stephens recounted. Hemphill was rushed to Grady Hospital, but it was too late. “This is just a pain that will never go away,” she said. “He was my only son. He was just only 13. Just the thought of me seeing him on the floor will never leave my brain. ” After returning home, several of his friends were outside the house. “There was about 40 to 50 kids outside,” Stephens said. “I guess these were the kids that were watching on live that live in the area. I guess when it happened they just ran over here. ” It is unclear how Hemphill came to have the gun on him. He was allegedly handed the gun by a friend police are looking into where the gun came from originally. This is not the first time a death has been streamed live on the internet using social media. In January, an Arkansas woman collapsed and died in front of her children while video livestreaming on Facebook. In December, a    in Georgia hanged herself on Facebook live.

8634,27370,Rep. Louie Gohmert: Protests Against Gorsuch Nomination Are ‘Fake News’ Funded by ‘Soros Money’,Breitbart,John Hayward,2017-02-01,2017.0,2.0,,"Rep. Louie Gohmert ( ) told Breitbart News Daily he was “excited” by President Donald Trump’s choice of Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. [“This is exactly why I got behind Donald Trump,” he told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. “This is why I was excited election night, is because we all expected Trump to keep his word. He has. He picked somebody from the list, and, in fact, he didn’t just pick somebody from the list he may have picked the very best person from the list. ”  “This is a man that, as far as we know, has not ruled on an abortion case, but we know from what he has ruled on that he believes in the Constitution,” Gohmert noted. “He believes that we have a right to religious freedom. Just as the government’s not to establish a religion, they’re not to prohibit the free exercise. We’ve had some justices  —   we’ve still got them on the court  —   that believe that the government can restrict the peaceful exercise and they can force people to go against their religious beliefs. If Hillary Clinton had made this selection, I think our religious freedom would be over. But it’s not. ”  “We have a good man. This guy is such a good candidate,” he declared. “I know the President and others have said he may be able to rule as a Supreme Court justice for maybe 30 more years. I’m hoping 40 years! I’m going to be praying for his good health. ” “And I’m simply praying that the Senate will do their jobs and get this guy confirmed. They confirmed him ten years ago,” Gohmert pointed out. “They had reviewed for anything that they’d like to bring against him ten years ago because he was going to be on the Court of Appeals, and those are critically important positions. There wasn’t anything there ten years ago. Once he’s on the Court of Appeals, then every Court of Appeals justice has in the back of their minds, ‘You know, I could be on the Supreme Court someday. I’d better keep my nose clean.’ And so it ought to be a very uneventful hearing. ” Gohmert recalled that he was originally a supporter of Senator Ted Cruz ( ) for president in 2016, having “fought in the trenches” with him, but now, he wondered how any serious conservative could complain about President Trump’s selection of Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. In light of this nomination, he pronounced the “NeverTrump” movement among some conservatives a “disastrous mistake. ” “Thank goodness those who said, ‘Never Trump’ did not keep him from being president because that would have been the end of too much,” he said. “So those who were NeverTrumpers, fine everybody’s entitled to your opinion, but at least you ought to get out there and acknowledge now, ‘Well, I wasn’t for Trump, but thankfully, he actually did keep his word, and we can all be grateful for that. ’” Gohmert said friends in the Senate told him they will make sure Gorsuch gets through the confirmation process, along with President Trump’s remaining cabinet nominees. One senator told him it was important to give Majority Leader Mitch McConnell space and time to shepherd the nominations through in his own way, rather than pressuring him for swift action and fiery confrontations with the Democrats. “The thing about this nomination, it’s replacing Antonin Scalia,” he said of Gorsuch. “The Left was pretty well getting their way with the courts, even with Scalia on there, being as conservative and originalist as he was. ”  “There’s a kind of feeling that I’m hearing about among some of the Democrats, especially those that are in states that voted for Trump, that, look, this shouldn’t be the one that we fight over,” he added. “If it’s Ginsburg, then we fight to the death to prevent a conservative, but this is Scalia. We’re not losing anything by getting somebody that might be close to being as conservative as Scalia. So this shouldn’t be where we fight to the death to keep him from being a vote, and this also could be the one that brings those senators that are Democrats in states that voted for Trump, it could be just what brings them down and turns their seat Republican. ” Gohmert did not think much of the Democrat claim that Gorsuch is an illegitimate nominee for a seat that was “stolen” from President Barack Obama’s designated successor to Scalia, Merrick Garland. “Last night, I came by the Supreme Court about 9:15, and they already had a massive demonstration out there, signs they were ready to go. They had their magic markers. They were ready to put whoever’s name had been cited by Trump as being terrible,” he observed. “You know, Have Poster Board, Will Travel. There they were. They were ready to condemn anybody, no matter who had been picked. If Trump had named the most   person in the country, they were out there ready to condemn. ” “This is fake news. This is people who are just out there to create the appearance of obstruction,” he said. “You know, Patrick Poole, remember back in one of the demonstrations on the Mall, caught one of the guys: ‘Hey, how much are you getting paid?’ He said, ‘$15 an hour. I thought everybody was getting that.’ They’re getting paid. The Soros money gets spread around. And actually, unfortunately, sometimes it’s our own government money that’s funding some of the obstructionism. But we have got to see this country through this and get Gorsuch confirmed so that this country will go on and still have a chance to survive, with our freedom intact,” he urged. Gohmert noted that every Democrat seems to be reading from a script that Gorsuch’s prospective Supreme Court seat “was supposed to be Obama’s seat to fill,” as Marlow noted. “They have the mantra. They might as well have been carrying their statements on a sign, and all they had to do was fill in the blank for the name,” he said, predicting that virtually every Democrat statement about Gorsuch will be prefaced with   “garbage. ” “I’m thanking God he got elected, and he’s keeping his word,” Gohmert said of President Trump. “It’s a day to rejoice for any Republican, anyone who’s a moderate, because otherwise, we get a leftist, and we’re done. So it’s a great day for America. It just really is. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN: "

Mass immigration, particularly illegal immigration, was a fait accompli. There is nothing the U. S. can do about it, and they must accept that America is “not their” country and that illegal aliens, particularly Latinos, “are not going to leave,” he said.  “I am an immigrant, just like many of you,” Ramos said in Spanish, as translated by the Media Research Center. “I am a proud Latino immigrant here in the United States. My name is Jorge Ramos, and I work at Univision and at the Fusion network. ” “And you know exactly what is going on here in the United States. There are many people who do not want us to be here, and who want to create a wall in order to separate us,” he said. “But you know what? This is also our country. Let me repeat this: Our country, not theirs. It is our country. And we are not going to leave. We are nearly 60 million Latinos in the United States,” he continued. “And thanks to us, the United States eats, grows and, as we’ve seen today, sings and dances. ” “So when they attack us, we already know what we are going to do. We are not going to sit down. We will not shut up. And we will not leave. That is what we are going to do,” he added. Ramos gave his speech on Friday during Premios Lo Nuestro, or “Our Awards,” on Univision. Ramos, who immigrated to the U. S. from Mexico, frequently portrays American law as unjust and prejudiced and supports open borders. “The taboo issue of an open border should be tackled. Not now. Politically it is impossible even to discuss that. But I don’t see why we can’t have in North America the same immigration that they have within the European Union,” Ramos said to Time magazine in 2014. The U. S. should not enforce its immigration laws even after illegal aliens kill Americans, he said during a CNN interview in August 2015, because that would be “completely unfair” to the illegal population. In June of 2016, Ramos told a crowd of illegal aliens gathered in Houston, Texas, “I think you the DREAMers are the Rosa Parks of this time. ” And Ramos’ views are not fringe ones in Mexico: A 2013 poll found that 66 percent of Mexicans believe the U. S. government has no right to limit immigration, while 52 percent said Mexicans have a right to be in the United States. Another 88 percent said it is fine to enter the U. S. illegally if one needs money. Over half, 56 percent, said they had friends or family who tried to immigrate to the U. S. illegally."

On Friday, ‘The Cook Political Report,’ which you know well, the kind of unofficial bible assessing House races, shifted its assessment of 20 seats now held by Republicans in the direction of Democrats. I’m not saying they’re going to win them, but that they are more likely for Democrats to win. You could lose your House majority over this. ” Priebus said, “Yeah, these are the same people that said Donald Trump wasn’t going to run and he ran, he couldn’t win the general, he won the general, he couldn’t get health care repeal and replace through the House, he got it through the House. Look, the fact of the matter is there are sometimes in life you have to do what’s right, not what’s politically expedient. We believe this is going to be a better product, and by the time people see the premiums are lower, it’s a better service, more options, more choices, they’re going to reward the Republicans that stood up and said we are not going to see the Obamacare system, which is failing and collapsing continue any longer. We’re going to do something better, and We’re going to do our job as legislators to get this thing done.

[In a post on his Twitter account Thursday, Hannnity linked to a report by New York magazine’s Gabriel Sherman that claimed Shine  —   a   veteran at Fox News  —   had requested a public statement of support from network CEO James Murdoch and   Lachlan Murdoch, but failed to receive one. According to Sherman’s report, Shine privately fears for his future at the network as it has endured a series of controversies, including the recent ouster of longtime star anchor Bill O’Reilly.  A Fox News spokesperson told Sherman that Shine denied having approached James and Lachlan Murdoch personally to ask for a statement of support, while a Murdoch spokesman said Shine had not directly requested a statement. “Gäbe i pray this is NOT true because if it is, that’s the total end of the FNC as we know it.

Sharpton said, “As I watched last night President Trump nominate Judge Gorsuch be in the Supreme Court  —   first of all let’s be clear, Gorsuch is a very conservative, go by the Founding Fathers kind of interpretation of how you deal with Constitutional law and would sit on that court and would rule in a way that would be against the interests of those of us that clearly when the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, was not considered full human beings and full citizens. So when you deal with the mentality and the legal profile of Judge Gorsuch, it is not a good one. But even beyond that, let us not forget he is not sitting, and being nominated to sit in Scalia’s seat, he’s being nominated to sit in Garland’s seat. President Barack Obama nominated Judge Garland, who has got as much or more qualifications as this nominee, to have been the Supreme Court judge. ” “Nominated him almost a year ago, Febuary of 16 when Scalia died,” he continued. “They stalled, they filibustered, they would not even give a hearing to Judge Garland. It is time for the Democrats now to say since you changed the rules, you’re going to have to live by the rules you applied to President Obama’s nominee, and we are not going to allow you to change it and we will use those rules to block this nominee, Gorsuch. The Bible says that you sow that  —   that same thing shall you also reap. But Bill Bellamy had a better idea —  they should come in the Senate and replay “The Big Payback,”  James Brown song. Bill was right, just take one of them old blasters, Chuck Schumer, and blast out The Big Payback. You took my judge. That ain’t right. Wouldn’t give a hearing.

[Greater Manchester Police said two men, aged 20 and 22, were detained early Saturday in the northwest England city on suspicion of terrorism offenses. Police used an explosive device to get into a property to make the arrests.  Police say they are now holding 11 men, aged between 18 and 44, in custody and have made major progress in their investigation. Mark Rowley, Britain’s top counterterrorism police officer, said authorities have dismantled a “large part” of the network around bomber Salman Abedi. But he said there were still “gaps in our understanding” of the plot, as investigators probed Abedi’s potential links to jihadis in Britain, Europe, Libya and the Middle East. The    Briton of Libyan descent died in Monday’s explosion, which killed 22 people and wounded dozens as crowds were leaving an Ariana Grande concert. After the bombing Britain raised its official threat status from terrorism to the top level, “critical”  —   meaning another attack may be imminent. Prime Minister Theresa May returned early from the   summit in Sicily, and will chair a meeting of the government’s COBRA emergency committee on Saturday. Hundreds of soldiers have been sent to replace police at   sites including Buckingham Palace and Parliament, and police armed with submachine guns are being deployed in city centers, transit hubs, tourist areas and major events. Despite the critical alert, police have urged people to go out and enjoy themselves over the   holiday weekend. More than 1, 000 armed police are on standby as major events including the Football Association Cup Final and the Premiership Rugby Final are expected to draw tens of thousands of people. Manchester is slowly returning to normal, though dozens of people remain hospitalized and the damaged arena and adjacent Victoria train station remain closed.

[The little girl, whose name was Faten, was confronted by a squad of women working as hisbah (morality police) for the Islamic State’s     Brigade while she was helping to clean her house and accidentally stepped outside.  The enforcers reportedly pronounced this a transgression of Islamic law and told her mother the penalty would be suffering a certain number of “bites” and asked if she wanted to endure the punishment on behalf of her child. The mother declined this offer and let her daughter take the punishment, at which point the   brigadiers whipped out a medieval torture device shaped like a set of iron fangs and went to work on little Faten. The girl ultimately bled to death from the wounds inflicted by the   “teeth” of the torture implement. This and other horror stories of life under the Islamic State in Mosul came from a woman who fled the city and spoke to Russian propaganda outlet Sputnik News. According to Sputnik, she claimed to know of at least two young girls killed with the iron fangs. She also spoke of the morality policy whipping women in the streets for failing to wear the mandatory   covering. According to the escapee, at least one woman died after taking 30 lashes for such an offense. This   account of lurid depravity echoes reports of similar torture using a device referred to by other sources as a “biter. ” As early as 2014, reports surfaced of the hisbah “causing severe pain and wounds [which] may lead women in some cases to be transported to the hospital” with the biter apparatus. In December 2015, a similar story to Faten’s surfaced of the morality police killing a woman for breastfeeding in public with the torture device. Previous accounts have also pointed to the role of the   Brigade in enforcing sharia law against women living under Islamic State occupation. Some of those accounts specifically referred to the use of the “biter” torture device against women, for such offenses as breastfeeding in public. Escapees have also smuggled video of the hisbah attacking from the Islamic State’s Syrian capital of Raqqa, in which they are seen enforcing the strict requirements for women’s clothing, among other things."

But since Ryan’s failure to pass the bill, Republicans have been negotiating amendments to make it more attractive to conservatives.  Days ago House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows ( ) told Breitbart News that he expected an Obamacare repeal bill to pass by the end of May, and now the group has announced its support of the newest measure.

Statement: https:  .   —   House Freedom Caucus (@freedomcaucus) April 26, 2017,  The group said in a Wednesday press release: Over the past couple of months, House conservatives have worked tirelessly to improve the American Health Care Act (AHCA) to make it better for the American people. Due to improvements to the AHCA and the addition of Rep. Tom MacArthur’s proposed amendment, the House Freedom Caucus has taken an official position in support of the current proposal. The MacArthur amendment will grant states the ability to repeal cost driving aspects of Obamacare left in place under the original AHCA.

The student alleges that he became uncomfortable when a biologically female student claiming to be a transgender “boy” began undressing next to him in a school locker room. The plaintiff and several other boys reported their feelings to the school’s assistant principal, but were verbally assaulted by the school official for being “intolerant. ” “Dr. Foley [the assistant principal] told [the plaintiff] to ‘tolerate’ it and to make it as ‘natural’ as he possibly can,” the lawsuit states. “It’s an egregious violation for the school to just brush off these students and tell them that their feelings don’t matter and to make it ‘as natural as they possibly can’,” attorney Wenger insisted. ILC also states that the school never brought any discussion on a transgender policy to either parents or the school board before allowing the transgender student into the boys’ locker room.

15517,34253,Exclusive: Former Pearson Exec Reveals Anti-American Agenda in Common Core - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,2016-01-21,2016.0,1.0,,"A former marketing executive for textbook publishing giant Pearson Education reveals the   agenda behind Common Core and the Advanced Placement U. S. History framework in the third video of a series produced by Project Veritas and focused on the corporate cronyism behind the education reform known as Common Core. [Kim Koerber, a former Pearson executive who now works as a sales consultant for National Geographic  —   another Gates   Common Core publisher  —   tells the Project Veritas undercover journalist that “conservative voters are afraid of everything,” and proceeds to say why Common Core is important in her view.  She explains that those behind Common Core and the new AP U. S. History framework have attempted to minimize the Constitution and remove Christianity from the core concepts, while they also stress the importance of teaching about Islam: “The dead white guys did not create this country,” Koerber says. “They [presumably conservatives] want to talk about those dead white guys. ” Koerber continues that Common Core is necessary because “it needs to be come cohesion between the states. ” She expresses frustration, however, that “Texas keeps screwing it up over and over again. ” “People who say they want to teach the Constitution, only want to teach the part of the Constitution that they like,” she tells the journalist, who then asks her about the Second Amendment. “But yet they don’t want to teach all of it,” she replies. “Damn the Second Amendment. ” The discussion continues: Kim Koerber (KK): People that are not educated, Fox TV viewers think that Common Core comes from the educated liberal groups and that’s why they are against it. They don’t know anything about it. They think it’s liberal so they’re against it. That’s what I think it is. It’s a knee jerk reaction. My mother, oh my God, she’s a Fox person. If I could remove Fox from my television set, I would  …     I did a big presentation yesterday for AP US History and the AP US History agenda was set, until Texas got upset about it and they wanted to have their founders  —   they wanted founders in it. And it’s like  —   come on. The dead white guys did not create this country. It was a whole bunch of different kinds of people. And yes there were women, and yes there were people of color, and yes  …    you need to talk about them too. But they want to talk about those dead white guys. And that’s the problem. You’re getting pushback, because there’s a bunch of Republican people, conservatives that don’t like being told what to do by people they don’t agree with. For example, in AP U. S. History a long time ago, Texas wanted to have U. S. History books, right? Pearson made them. And it talked about the Wild West and how there were prostitutes, right. And Texas was really upset. They didn’t want to mention  …    I’m like  …    You’re too young to  …     Did you watch Gun Smoke? It was a TV show, and you had Marshall Dillon and Ms. Kitty was his friend. She owned a bar and she was a prostitute. They never mentioned it but that’s what she was. It’s like who was Ms. Kitty? Who were these people who went out and serviced these men that went out in the world? That was real. The Wild West was not a nice place. And our kids need to know that that’s what it was like, you know. Project Veritas Journalist (PV): But these people in Texas are really upset that the Constitution is not being covered. KK: It is being covered, but not the way they  …    cause they’re idiots and they don’t know what’s in it. PV: Is it covered as much as it would have been? KK: In 12th grade government it certainly is, and in 5th grade it is. Yes. PV: “It’s not a necessity for the kids. ” KK: You should know a little bit about it, you shouldn’t have to memorize the thing. Republicans want to get in there and talk about stuff and change things about school stuff because they want to, they want to influence what is being taught. Common core doesn’t put up with that. PV: Yeah. And, so it’s not really being  …     A lot of these complaints about it are not so much about the content yeah  …     KK: They’re misunderstanding they are people that don’t really know what they are talking about. I  …    I can’t stand it. If they talk to me one more time about  …    climate change not being real, I’m just gonna scream. PV: I am really glad I’m here in California, whatever religious affiliation you want to take is fine, but in Texas they want to push the Christianity. KK: Because they think it’s the only one. PV: They do, and I see that. KK: That’s why it’s so offensive to have these prayers in the school board. PV: Christianity is totally out of the common core? KK: Yes it is. Totally. It’s not a core concept at all. PV: But then there is a mention of other religions like Islam. KK: Yeah well you have to because   …     PV: So how did Islam get worked in? KK: Islam  …    they said you have to talk about Islam, you have to talk about Judaism and you have to talk about Christianity and they wanted to make it big about Christianity no it’s like, everybody needs to know about everything else  …     PV: Is that one of the complaints, that common core does have a liberal bias? KK: Yes, they feel like we’d be educating their kids to the world which they don’t want to do that. They want their kids to only know this  …     It’s like birth control. They don’t want their kids to know about it, yet Chlamydia is huge in Texas. So it’s like, you know  …    In the schools that have kids that, because the kids don’t learn about anything about what they’re doing and they’re messing around and they get in trouble because they didn’t get educated. So, I think the progressive bias is the more educated you are, the better you are, and the conservative bias is the less they know the better they are going to be. Yeah. PV: What is it that they don’t agree with? KK: They don’t agree with Islam, so they don’t want their kids to be taught it. They don’t agree with birth control so they don’t want their kids to talk about it. They don’t agree with math because they don’t understand it. It’s not the same math they did in high school. So they don’t want their kids to know about it. It’s conservative push back, that, they are afraid. So these conservative, these conservative voters are afraid of everything. PV: I’m just wondering why Common Core specifically  …    before Common Core kids were learning about math and science. KK: Because it’s the government telling me what to do. People who say they want to teach the Constitution, only want to teach the part of the Constitution that they like. PV: Second Amendment? KK: But yet they don’t want to teach all of it. Damn the Second Amendment. I don’t think personal handguns need to be on anyone except the government, the police. What is the purpose of having a gun? The separation of church and state they don’t understand. They don’t like that. They don’t like equal rights between all groups. The voter suppression that is going on in the south is just unbelievably awful. People who are not educated are easy flim flam. And that they react by fear instead of by knowledge. The Project Veritas journalist asks Koerber about the profits for textbook publishers with the Common Core reform. KK: Anytime anybody changes something in a textbook its profitable for the textbook companies. So the textbooks have to change and the school district has to adopt the new ones, that’s profitable. PV: Say that again. KK: Anytime a change happens that has to be put in a textbook suddenly the school district has to adopt new books. The video also includes footage of Project Veritas president James O’Keefe at the South Carolina Tea Party convention, during which Republican 2016 frontrunner Donald Trump told his audience Common Core is a “disaster,” and that no candidate can win who is in favor of Common Core. “We spend more than anybody else and to a large extent that’s Common Core, because these people in Washington  —   the bureaucrats  —   are making a fortune,” Trump said. “They don’t give a damn about your kids in South Carolina. ” O’Keefe asked Sen. Ted Cruz about the corporate cronyism behind Common Core. “I’ll tell you this, as President, I will instruct the Department of Education to end Common Core on day one,” Cruz said. Former Sen. Rick Santorum also asserted, “I am very much against Common Core, against any kind of federal intervention into our schools. That’s the big problem. ” Asked about the major issues surrounding Common Core, Santorum replied: The elites in our culture who want to indoctrinate our young people into a certain way to think, a certain belief structure, and it’s all spread out through Common Core. I believe the best and safest way to maintain our values in this country is to leave it up to the people at the grass roots level. “It doesn’t matter if it’s corporate cronyism or liberal ideology, if you are slipping your agenda into our education system, we are going to expose you, one by one, until the whole rotten system is revealed,” O’Keefe tells Breitbart News about his project on Common Core and education. “Corporate cronyism and underhanded political deals have contributed to Common Core’s massive disruption and the unraveling of America’s educational fabric. ” OO. ready( function()  ) })"

Ted Cruz ( ) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.  “Rafael! Straight out of the hills of Canada,” Trump said about Cruz, saying he spent “four years in Canada [and] was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. ” “If he wins, he’s not going to win  …     despite the fact that they’re buying off delegates  …     If he ever did, the first thing that the Democrats are going to do is sue him on the basis that he’s not a naturalized citizen, that he wasn’t born in this country,” Trump said, adding, “I happen to think they’re going to win. ” A few months ago, Trump repeatedly raised questions about whether or not Cruz is eligible to run for president since he was born in Canada to a mother who was a U.

16481,35218,No Water: Migrant Teens Left to Die for 5 Days in Texas,Breitbart,Ildefonso Ortiz,2016-04-28,2016.0,4.0,,"FALFURRIAS, Texas  —   A    girl is fighting to survive after a cartel human smuggler abandoned her and her    sister in the brush area. The teens were left to die and spent five days in the dangerous brush without water. [The rescue took place on Tuesday near at a ranch in Brooks County, information released to Breitbart Texas by U. S. Border Patrol revealed. Additional sources from the area revealed that the girls were left behind near Laborcitas Creek.  Brooks County is located about 80 miles north of the Mexican border and has become well known for the large numbers of deaths of illegal immigrants who are abandoned by their smugglers because they become injured or too weak to keep up. The rescue began when the Brooks County Sheriff’s Office received a 911 call from the human smuggler who said he had left the girls behind and they had not had water for five days. Authorities began a search of the area. A ranch hand eventually found the girls shortly before authorities arrived.  Because of the    girl’s poor medical condition authorities called in a helicopter in orderto rush her to a hospital in Corpus Christi. Initially, the girl was listed in grave condition. She has since been transferred to a children’s hospital also in Corpus Christi because her condition continued to worsen.  The girl’s    sister gave agents false identification cards. Authorities were eventually able to confirm their nationality and ages with the Mexican Consulate, “These heartless criminals take ruthless steps to exploit the multitude of poor immigrants from Mexico and Central America trying to reach the United States at any cost and the problem is getting worse,” said Chief Patrol Agent Manuel Padilla, Jr.  “No one wants to see their loved ones being violated or abandoned in this manner. ”    The rescue of the two girls comes just one day after Mexican cartel human smugglers abandoned a    girl from El Salvador on the banks of the Rio Grande moments after crossing before returning back to Mexico.  Earlier this week, Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby and Associate Editor Bob Price reported about these specific kinds of horror faced by these illegal immigrants because of the open border policies of the federal government. Rape, abuse, abandonment and death are often the treatment these people receive from their human smugglers who are often connected to Mexican cartels. Efforts by the Brooks County Sheriff’s Office, the Border Patrol, Texas Department of Public Safety Troopers, Texas Rangers and members of the Texas State Guard have ramped up efforts find people like these two young girls and rescue them before they die. “Fortunately, because of the efforts of our deputies, the Border Patrol’s presence, help from the State of Texas with Texas Rangers, Department of Public Safety Troopers, and members of the Texas State Guard, the number of deaths this year is lower,” Brooks County Chief Deputy Benny Martinez told Breitbart Texas in an interview this week. “We have worked hard to do as much as we can with the limited resources we have and have pushed state officials to send us help. The lives saved as a result speaks to how well our people are doing. ” Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas you can follow him on Twitter and on Facebook."
16824,35561,First Deposition Testimony from Clinton Email Discovery Released,Breitbart,Tom Fitton,2016-05-31,2016.0,5.0,,"The   discovery to uncover details about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s email system has produced the first testimony from her top aides. [Last week, we released the deposition transcript of Ambassador Lewis Lukens, former deputy assistant secretary of state and executive director of the State Department’s executive secretariat.  The transcript is available here.  We deposed Amb. Lukens as part of the discovery granted to Judicial Watch by U. S. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan in response to our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit involving Clinton’s unsecured,   email system (Judicial Watch v. U. S. Department of State (No. 1:  )).  Lukens testified that he thought it was not unusual that Mrs. Clinton did not ask him to create a State Department email account for her.  He testified that he understood that her BlackBerry use was only to “stay in touch with friends and family. ” Lukens, according to his testimony, saw Clinton “maybe a half a dozen times,” positioned “in the hallway outside the SCIF [Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility] standing there looking at her BlackBerry. ” Lukens testified that he saw Mrs. Clinton with her BlackBerry on foreign trips and that her aide Huma Abedin carried around two BlackBerrys. Lukens also testified about his 2009 email exchanges with Cheryl Mills in which he offered to set up a separate computer on a   Department network to allow Mrs. Clinton to check her email: Q: After your conversation with Ms. Mills, Ms. Mills   you, and it talks about  —   I’m sorry, the quality of the   is a little difficult to read, but it says: “Let’s set up the office across the hall for her to use. It needs a phone, et cetera, so she can go across the hall to check her BB,” her BlackBerry. You mentioned that you talked about setting up a computer in her office. Do you know why Ms. Mills seemed to prefer having the computer set up in the office across the hall? A: This wasn’t for a computer setup this was to create a space for her to go check her BlackBerry. Q: Okay. In the Secretary’s office, is that what’s considered a SCIF? A: The Secretary’s office is in a SCIF, which encompasses a lot more of the seventh floor. Q: Okay. And the office that’s across the hall is outside that area? A: Correct. Lukens also testified about his idea to set up a separate computer and network for Mrs. Clinton.  Cheryl Mills and Lukens discussed the email issue in early 2009: A: So the crux of the issue was that BlackBerrys and iPhones are not allowed in the Secretary’s office suite, so the question was, how is the Secretary going to be able to check her   if she’s not able to have the BlackBerry at her desk with her. Q: And so what did you  —   did you propose a solution at that point? A: So my proposal was to set up a computer on her desk, a standalone computer, for her to be able to access the Internet to check her  .  *** Q: Do you know if this setup would have been any different from the setup of other employees? A: Yes, this would have been different. Q:  How would it have been different? A: My understanding is that most of the employees’ computers in the State Department are connected through the State Department’s OpenNet   system, Internet system. Q: So this one would have been separate from the OpenNet system? A: Correct. Ultimately, according to his testimony, the computer was not set up for Mrs. Clinton. Lukens is the first of seven depositions of former Clinton top aides and State Department officials that we have scheduled over the next four weeks.  Also to be deposed are Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin, as well as top State Department official Patrick Kennedy, and former State IT employee Bryan Pagliano.  In granting the discovery, U. S. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan noted that “based on information learned during discovery, the deposition of Mrs. Clinton may be necessary. ” That this key State Department witness was insistent that he did not know Clinton was using  . gov emails and computer equipment for government business is noteworthy.  It suggests the agency is seeking to distance itself from Mrs. Clinton’s conduct."
17161,35899,Court Ruling May Force Schools To Have Only Dual-Sex Bathrooms - Breitbart,Breitbart,Austin Ruse,2016-04-20,2016.0,4.0,,"The North Carolina law allowing schools and companies to keep separate bathrooms for females and males has been undermined by a new decision from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals which apparently bars   bathrooms. [In a press conference today, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory said, “I very strongly disagree with both President Obama and, frankly, Attorney General Roy Cooper’s [political] objective to force high schools to allow boys in girls’ restrooms or shower facilities. I think it is bad precedent and I don’t think it’s the tradition way we do things. ”  The decision announced yesterday concerned a high school girl in Gloucester, Va. who thinks she’s a boy and who wants the school to validate her feelings by allowing her to use the boys’ bathrooms. The school offered to let her to use a private restroom, but she insisted on getting official approval to use the boys’ room. Two of the three judges backed her claim, saying they defer to a letter from officials at the Department of Education who claim that   prohibitions on sex discrimination also bar discrimination based on “gender identity. ” But that decision, however make it impossible for schools to have bathrooms just for boys or just for girls, and also impossible for schools to comply with federal privacy laws, said a statement from the judge who opposed the decision.  Since then, transgender activists have asked the Department of Education to enforce the   decision in Virginia on all   schools. Progressive groups are promoting the “bathroom equality” campaign as part of a large push to outlaw and stigmatize any actions or attitudes that recognize the routine differences in physical abilities and personal preferences between male and female Americans.  McCrory told reporters that he has asked his legal team to look at the decision and determine what their way forward might be. He insisted he is sworn to uphold decisions of the court and that he would do so in this case. McCrory also pointed out that 27 other states that do not allow men in dresses into women’s bathrooms. He said the decision will likely go to the Supreme Court. North Carolina Senate Leader Phil Berger said, “People need to wake up: Roy Cooper, Barack Obama and two unelected federal judges are on the verge of completing their radical social reengineering of our society by forcing middle   girls to share school locker rooms with boys. House Bill 2 was our effort to stop this insanity, and I hope this proves the bathroom safety bill has nothing to do with discrimination and everything to do with protecting women’s privacy and keeping men out of girls’ bathrooms. ” Studies show there are only a miniscule number of “transgenders” in the United States. According to the   Williams Institute at UCLA less than   of one percent of the US population identifies as “trans” which would mean only 1 in every 440 people have the affliction of “gender dysphoria. ” A study of 2010 census data indicates that only 1 in every 2, 400 adults want to live as members of the other sex."

[Jackson’s 2, 700 acre Neverland estate, which has since been renamed Sycamore Valley Ranch, was purchased by the star in 1987 for a price tag of $19. 5 million.  Located in Los Olivos, Calif. the compound has been under the control of Colony Capital since 2008, after the singer stopped making payments amid financial woes.

[In an interview with the Daily Beast, the    Breaking Bad star said it still doesn’t feel “real” to him that a “supreme narcissist” like Trump could become President of the United States.  Cranston told the Beast: “He’s an anomaly to politics and an anomaly to the human race, as far as I’m concerned. He’s just a bizarre human being. I don’t think that’s a statement that anybody can even argue. ‘Is he a normal human being?’ I don’t think anybody can say, ‘Yeah, he’s pretty normal!’ No! He’s very, very far away from normal. Even if you agree with him, he’s still far away from normal, and we need a president like our current president, who I believe has shown the qualities we want in a president: restraint, introspection, diplomacy, thoughtfulness, sensitivity, intelligence, not to be hyperbolic, to be presidential, to be respectful, and to be patient. President Obama has the qualities that anyone would want, and I think a President Clinton would have those qualities as well. But we know that Donald Trump does not have that. ” Cranston, who previously called Trump’s unfiltered candor “refreshing,” said that while he disagrees with Trump’s rhetoric and policy proposals, he at least attempts to understand why many Americans support him. “[W]hen I meet those who are voting for Donald Trump, I don’t try to disprove their interests,” the actor told the Beast. “I’m curious how they came to that position. But I think this is incredibly important: I don’t want to disrespect anyone’s opinion. This is how they feel. But I would be very interested and curious to see how they came to this decision. ” The   Democrat went on to praise Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and the impact he has had on the 2016 race, saying that the insurgent candidate’s battle against Clinton made her a “better candidate, a stronger campaigner” and a “stronger debater. ” Cranston added that just because he supports Clinton for president does not mean that Republicans are “evil” or “villainous” in any way. “They’re not. They love the country just as much as I do, and I think that’s a thing that we need to step away from,” he said. “We need to step away from making enemies and villains out of someone who has a different ideology than yours. ” Cranston’s latest film, The Infiltrator, about an undercover operation targeting Pablo Escobar’s   cronies, opened last weekend. The film took in $6. 7 million over five days, landing in eighth place at the weekend box office.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum"

[The study reveals that while the service had over 11, 000 titles available in 2012, that number has now dropped to around 5, 300 titles in the US, with the number differing slightly depending on the host country.  Netflix cites the company’s focus on providing exclusive content as the primary reason for the shrinking of their overall content library, as it attempts to fight off fierce competition from services such as Amazon Prime and Hulu. The service has produced hit shows such as House of Cards, Orange Is the New Black, and Stranger Things and plans to continue investing in original content as a core part of the company’s strategy. “You should expect us to push toward more   in terms of original exclusive content and licensed content,” said the company’s CFO David Wells recently.    Evidence of this strategy is clear judging by the size of its recent investments, which include $120 million on The Get Down, directed by Baz Luhrmann, and $90 million on Bright, a film starring Will Smith.

21598,40345,"House Democrats Launch Bill To Ban Religious Exemptions For Abortions, Gender Transition Services - Breitbart",Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,2016-05-25,2016.0,5.0,,"Two House Democrats have introduced legislation that would amend the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) to ensure religious exemptions cannot be applied to any health care service, including abortion and gender transition treatments. [Reps. Joe Kennedy III ( ) and Bobby Scott ( ) introduced the Do No Harm Act, which states:  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 should not be interpreted to authorize an exemption from generally applicable law that imposes the religious views, habits, or practices of one party upon another  …     The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 should not be interpreted to authorize an exemption that permits discrimination against other persons, including persons who do not belong to the religion or adhere to the other beliefs of those to whom the exemption is given  …    the misapplication of RFRA has been used to deny health care coverage for employees, claim exemptions to civil rights law, and complicate justice in child labor and abuse cases. Kennedy says the 1993 RFRA is currently being misused. A press release states the legislation “comes in response to continued efforts across the country to cite religious belief as grounds to undermine Civil Rights Act protections, limit access to healthcare, and refuse service to minority populations. ” “Specifically, the Do No Harm Act would limit the use of RFRA in cases involving discrimination, child labor and abuse, wages and collective bargaining, access to health care, public accommodations, and social services provided through government contract,” the press release continues, specifying that entities that operate with a government contract would be required to submit to the legislation’s mandate. Kennedy stated: The right of Americans to freely and fully express our faith is sacred in this country. But in order to guarantee that liberty for every citizen, our system must ensure that my religious freedom does not infringe on yours or do you harm. While not its original intent, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act has become a vehicle for those seeking to impose their beliefs on others or claim that the tenants of their faith justify discrimination. The Do No Harm Act will restore the balance between our right to religious freedom and our promise of equal protection under law. Scott also said the 1993 RFRA has been “misconstrued as allowing the   religious beliefs of one person to trump the civil rights of others. ” “[W]e cannot allow   ‘religious freedom,’ ‘religious liberty’ or ‘  initiatives’ to invalidate the very laws designed to correct the generations of injustices inflicted on minorities,” he added. “The Do No Harm Act restores the original intent of RFRA. ” The leftwing Center for American Progress (CAP) backs the legislation. “[R]ecent lawsuits and federal court decisions, such as the Supreme Court’s 2014 Hobby Lobby v. Burwell decision, have created an overly broad interpretation of the law and have allowed RFRA to be used in ways that actually restrict religious liberty by imposing beliefs on others and occasioning meaningful harm to third parties,” said Carmel Martin, executive vice president of policy at CAP. “Congress should act to ensure that RFRA is not inappropriately used to violate the rights of others. ” Louise Melling, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the 1993 RFRA requires “much needed limitations. ” “Religious freedom gives us the right to our beliefs, but not to harm others,” she said. “The Do No Harm Act would place much needed limitations on RFRA, so that it can be used as a shield for religious exercise but no longer as a sword. With the Do No Harm Act, RFRA could no longer be invoked to justify discrimination, denial of health care, or other harms. We at the ACLU are proud to stand in support of this legislation. ” In an   at the Washington Post in June of 2015, Melling wrote the ACLU will no longer defend the 1993 RFRA. The ACLU  —   whose stated mission was once “to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the Constitution and laws of the United States”  —   says that while the organization supported the RFRA when it was passed, “we can no longer support the law in its current form” because “it is now often used as a sword to discriminate against women, gay and transgender people and others. ” According to Melling, who condemned use of RFRA by the Supreme Court in its Hobby Lobby decision last year: They invoke the RFRA to argue not only that they should not have to provide insurance coverage for contraceptives, but also that they should not even have to notify the government that they refuse to do so because, they maintain, notification would trigger the government to intervene to ensure coverage. In the states, legislators, governors and businesses are citing state religious freedom restoration acts to justify all manner of discrimination against gay men and lesbians, including at commercial establishments. At the federal level, the Justice Department  —   under both the Bush and Obama administrations  —   has said that the government would violate the RFRA if it were to require that organizations not discriminate in hiring on religious grounds in order to receive government funding. Melling criticized the U. S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, who say RFRA supports them in their refusal to provide abortions and contraceptives  —   which are against their faith’s doctrine  —   to illegal immigrant minors in their care. She also condemned Christian wedding cake bakers for inviting LGBT activists asking for   wedding cakes to purchase them elsewhere. “People turned away by an inn or bakery suffer the harm of being told that their kind isn’t welcome,” complained Melling. “Religious liberty doesn’t mean the right to discriminate or to impose one’s views on others. ” However, Jeff Bailey, a Baptist pastor in Attleboro, Massachusetts, said Kennedy’s and Scott’s legislation would allow the government to decide which religious freedoms are legitimate, rather than the people, reports the Sun Chronicle. “This bill would limit the RFRA to areas which agree with the secular progressive agenda,” Bailey said. “Simply stated, this means that religious liberty is what the government says it is. There is no liberty in that. ” Religion should never be used as a tool to discriminate. This bill would put a stop to that: https:  .  @Broadly,  —   NARAL (@NARAL) May 20, 2016,  The legislation also has the support of Catholics for Choice Center for Reproductive Rights GLBTQ Legal Advocates  Defenders Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) Guttmacher Institute Human Rights Campaign National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda Lambda Legal NAACP NARAL National Abortion Federation National Center for Lesbian Rights National Center for Transgender Equality National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health National LGBTQ Task Force Planned Parenthood Sexuality Information and Education Council of the US (SIECUS) and Unitarian Universalist Association."
22082,40829,"Hillary Clinton’s Worst Week—Yet, According to the MSM, Her Best Week - Breitbart",Breitbart,James P. Pinkerton,2016-08-21,2016.0,8.0,,"If the 2016 presidential race is tightening, how come the Main Stream Media is acting as though it’s widening? Indeed, why is the MSM indicating to us that Hillary Clinton is going to defeat Donald Trump in a landslide? Why are Republicans being told that they should abandon all hope of winning the White House?  To answer those questions, we can cite the MSM Rule of Inverse Electoral Correlation: The closer the presidential race gets, the louder the MSM declares that it’s over. And all this comes even as Clinton has had a terrible week —  arguably her worst week ever, as the billowing smoke of financial scandal clouds herself and her family. Let’s consider: A couple of weeks ago, Clinton was enjoying   leads. And yet the latest Morning Consult poll has Clinton up just three, 39 to 36 —  hardly a commanding lead. And the USC Dornsife poll actually has Trump up two points. Such numbers, we can observe, don’t quite comport with a Democratic runaway. Or, as Robin, the Boy Wonder, might have said to his caped mentor: “Holy shifting narratives, Batman!” Yet of course, the MSM has plenty ammo still to fire. Having been instructed by The New York Times to abandon even the pretense of impartiality by taking an “oppositional” stance toward Trump, Big Journalism is now doubling down on behalf of the Democrats hence this August 19 headline bannered atop Politico: “GOP insiders: Trump’s overhaul won’t   Roughly a third of Republican respondents say the addition of [Stephen K.] Bannon and promotion of [Kellyanne] Conway will make things worse. ” (We might note that this bit of   “news” led   pundit Mickey Kaus to react with a snarkily ironic tweet: “AUSPICIOUS SIGN FOR TRUMP. ”) And yet the very next day, Politico dutifully followed up with another    piece, headlined: “Republicans prep ‘break glass’ emergency plan as Trump   Losing hope for the White House, the GOP is exploring a plan to cast congressional candidates as a check on President Hillary Clinton. ” The MSM’s intentions are obvious: Journos are seeking to stampede Republicans into panicky defeatism. Hence this Los Angeles Times headline: “New poll analysis finds a wasted summer for Donald Trump and a boost for Hillary Clinton. ” Indeed, even the folks at Morning Consult, the pollsters who found Hillary up by just a thin three points, nevertheless chose to ignore their own findings —  in journalism, the term is “bury the lede” —  by using this   headline: “Trump’s Campaign Shakeup Is Likely Too Little, Too Late. ” Yes, that’s right: a mere   deficit in August means certain defeat for Trump in November. Yet despite this MSM relentlessness, some observers within the Establishment have noticed the change in the electoral environment after all, when   of the voters agree that the country is on the wrong track, it’s dangerous to be an incumbent —  or, in Hillary’s case, a  . And so on August 21, Lee Drutman, a   fellow at the   New America Foundation, was moved to tweet, “Hmmmm.. the 4 most recent polls form a   here. This race may be tightening again. ” Still, the tireless MSM tide rolls on. Here’s the best headline yet, courtesy of The Washington Post: “With a comfortable lead, Clinton begins laying plans for her White House agenda. ” As Robin might also say, “Holy chutzpah, Batman!” In the very first paragraph of that     ’  story, we see this glib reference to Clinton’s   plans as the 45th president: Such plans include, we learn, “enacting immigration reform if current polling holds and she is easily elected to the White House in November. ” We can recall that “immigration reform” has cracked up twice in the past decade —  once under George W. Bush and again under Barack Obama —  when the issue was much less salient than it is today. Indeed, just in the last year or so, the grim specter of jihadi terrorism has forced Americans to look askance at “refugees” from anywhere. So we can wonder: Will the fearful public assessment of the threat from open borders really be any different in 2017? Yet of course, we aren’t in 2017 yet —  we’re still in 2016. And in addition to Trump growing stronger on the stump, perhaps the biggest change in the last week has been the growing realization that the Clinton Foundation is an indictment waiting to happen. Indeed, we can also observe: What a difference four years makes. During the previous presidential campaign, on September 25, 2012, Mitt Romney actually traveled to New York to pay homage to the Clintons, piling on the praise. First, the Republican nominee   the Democratic former president personally: “A few words from Bill Clinton can do any man a lot of good. ” And then Romney went on to laud the 42nd president’s “good works”: President Clinton has devoted himself to lifting the downtrodden around the world. One of the best things that can happen to any cause, to any people, is to have Bill Clinton as its advocate. That is how needy and neglected causes have become global initiatives. Such slobbering admiration must have been confusing to potential Republican voters in that election year. If Romney thought so highly of Bill Clinton, and if Clinton had so strongly endorsed Barack Obama, then why should anyone vote for Romney? Heck, by that logic, maybe Romney himself should have voted for Obama. (Moreover, as we consider the situation today, we might also ask: If Romney thinks so highly of the Clintons and their works, should we really trust his judgment when he excoriates Trump?) Perhaps Romney, obsessed as he has been with trashing Trump, is not aware of it, but in the years since 2012, the public’s perception of the Clinton family outfit has changed dramatically. Undoubtedly, the biggest single reason for this change is the publication of Peter Schweizer’s landmark book, Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich. Indeed, that 2015 volume, published with the help of the Government Accountability Institute (full disclosure: at the time, Stephen K. Bannon served as Executive Chairman of both Breitbart News and GAI Schweizer as President of GAI and Senior    for Breitbart) is still a    . And so whereas four years ago, the   Romney campaign had nothing but praise for Clinton, Inc. today, the much   Trump campaign has nothing but scorn. Indeed, on Sunday morning, Rudy Giuliani, the       joined in the 2016 GOP nominee’s blunt assessment of “Crooked Hillary,” adding, “She is the consummate corrupt Washington insider. ” The Hill summed up Giuliani’s sharp view: “The Clinton Foundation should be indicted as a racketeering enterprise. ” RICO suit, anyone? Moreover, later on the same Sunday came   news for the Clinton “philanthropy”: The       Huffington Post called for the foundation to be shut down. Ouch! Yet revealingly, The Washington Post (also known as the “Bezos Post”) story, the one doping out Hillary’s first term, never so much as mentioned the words “Clinton Foundation. ” So sure, by any objective measure, Hillary has had a horrendous week. But given the shameless partisanship of the MSM, that only means that we can expect another spate of glowing “Hillary Ahead!” headlines tomorrow. And tomorrow. And tomorrow."
22161,40908,Exclusive-America’s Generals: ’Criminal’ Hillary ’Unfit to Serve as Commander-in-Chief’ - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dustin Stockton,2016-11-08,2016.0,11.0,,"In the final hours before voters across the nation will select the next President, many veterans who attained the rank of General are trying to get the word out that Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton is a criminal who is unfit to serve as commander in chief. [Clinton’s mishandling of classified information, illegal    schemes involving the Clinton campaign and Clinton Foundation, and her foreign policy failures as Secretary of State leave her unfit to serve as    several generals told Breitbart News.  Trump was endorsed by 88 former Generals and Admirals in September and that number has now grown to more than 200. Retired Army Brigadier General Ernie Audino is a Senior Military Fellow at the London Center for Policy Research. He is the only U. S. Army General to have served a year as a combat advisor embedded in a Kurdish Peshmerga brigade. He explained what would have happened to him or someone in his command if they had been “extremely reckless” handling classified information. There is no question that my career as a US Army officer would have ended. Period. I would have gone from General to Mister practically overnight. Saying, “Oops, I didn’t meant to,” while perhaps interesting, would be less than meaningless. Public servants, and especially military leaders, are held to a high standard. The lives of brave Americans demand it. It is our duty to ensure such leakage of classified material never occurs on our watch, and if it occurs intentionally, then prepare for an all expenses paid visit to the prison at Fort Leavenworth. Retired Airforce Major General Bentley Rayburn has campaigned for Trump in Colorado and joined about two dozen other Generals, Admirals, and Medal of Honor Recipients in North Carolina in the final week before the campaign. General Rayburn didn’t mince his words calling Clinton a “criminal” and explained how he had to fire a secretary for far less damaging breaches of classified protocol. “Hillary is a criminal. The way she handled classified information is criminal and to have a commander in chief who so blatantly disregarded those national security procedures would be a big problem for the military,” Rayburn said. Asked if he expects people charged with mishandling classified information to use the “Hillary defense,” General Rayburn scoffed, “They already have. They didn’t get very far because their last name isn’t Clinton. ” Retired Army Lt. General Michael Flynn told Breitbart News that Clinton placed the country in “grave risk” with her handling of State secrets. “It was a violation of the law. It’s not just violation of State Department guidelines,” Flynn told SiriusXM host Matthew Boyle. “Let’s forget about the pedophilia, let’s forget about the Clinton Foundation for a second and let’s focus on Hillary Clinton’s grave risk that she’s placed our country at by using a private server to do business at the most sensitive levels of our government. ” The General’s issues with Clinton don’t end with Clinton’s “extremely reckless” handling of classified information. Clinton’s foreign policy during her tenure as Secretary of State in the Obama administration was characterized as “terrible,” “awful,” and “a disaster” by the Generals. “Even if you could set aside the classified information breaches, her foreign policy during her time as Secretary of State  —  ” General Rayburn said. “It’s clear they didn’t understand the situation in the   and made a mess of it. They rushed out of Iraq by failing to get a Status of Forces agreement. They didn’t understand the Arab Spring. They didn’t understand the divide between Sunni and Shia. They didn’t understand or stop the persecution of Christians. Foreign Policy under Clinton and Obama was terrible and if God forbid she gets in office it will still be terrible. ” General Audino worried that the   strategy of alienating our allies and embracing our enemies would continue under a Clinton presidency. While she was Secretary of State, U. S. foreign policy left our   allies wondering if we had their back. They are wondering if they can ever trust the USA again. Egypt is wondering if we’ve got their back.  Saudi Arabia is wondering if we’ve got their back. The Kurds are wondering if we’ve got their back. We’ve drawn red lines in the sand and then chickened out. All of this and more has seriously undermined our diplomatic power, one of the four elements of national power. The other three being military, economic and information. General Flynn made it clear how high the stakes are in this election, telling Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle, “It’s more than the most important presidential election in our lifetimes. It’s one of the most important in the history of our country. You can rattle off guys like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, both Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt. Ronald Reagan. This raises to that level, because our country is either going to become a socialist country or we’re going to continue on a path to prosperity with Donald Trump. ” Dustin Stockton is a political reporter for Breitbart News, a community liaison for Gun Owners of America, and a political strategist.

22258,41005,John Bolton on Europe’s Migrant Crisis: ‘Only a Matter of Time Before Some of Those Terrorists Get to the United States’ - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dan Riehl,2016-04-14,2016.0,4.0,,"Former UN ambassador John Bolton believes the impact of Europe’s ongoing migrant crisis on America is “huge” and is one of the reasons why national security “has got to be at the center of the 2016 debate” because, as he pointed out, “It’s only a matter of time before some of those terrorists get to the United States. ”[Bolton told Breitbart News Daily host Stephen K. Bannon: “Let’s be clear, once these refugees get to Europe, they’re merely a plane ride away from the United States, and the threat of terrorism that we know has come with what may be legitimate refugees but a lot of other people seeking to exploit the breakdown of border controls across the European Union to get into the continent and then carry out attacks down the road. It’s only a matter of time before some of those terrorists get to the United States.   …     What we’re seeing in Europe could well be a precursor to what we’re going to see here if the Europeans don’t get their act together. ”  Citing Europe as “a source of American culture and political thought and an enormously important economic partner,” Bolton said that if “Europe declines even further than it has, and I’m one that thinks the European Union has made Europe less than the sum of its parts, but if it shows increasing incapacity to deal with these problems, that is harmful to the United States. ” Bolton also sees the crisis getting worse and potentially resulting in Britain opting out of the EU in a coming referendum. He said, “I think it’s getting worse in part because of the massive flows of people who have already entered on the continent of Europe out of Turkey or through other means. And it’s going to get worse in the coming months, in the  spring and the summer as the sailing season across the Mediterranean opens up, and so you have flows of people from all across North Africa, not just from Syria and Iraq and the rest of the Middle East. And I still think we’re seeing a complete breakdown of the capability of the European Union to deal with this. It was a breakdown when Chancellor Merkel first invited in 800, 000 refugees. That total is now over a million and a half. ” Bolton also pointed out that smaller countries like Macedonia are not getting any assistance from the larger EU countries. He feels that will have a ripple effect leading to more and more countries opting to close their borders. “The real touchstone here on the effect of all this on the British referendum in June on whether to remain in the European Union  at all,” he noted. “I think watching what they’re seeing in Europe is going to contribute to a ‘leave’ vote that might actually prevail. ” As regards what America’s response should be, Bolton seemed very clear. “The American people are very humanitarian,” he said. “When they see refugees, they want to give them food and shelter in refugee camps so that they’re not displaced and simply living out in the open. That is the first response to a refugee crisis. The first response is not, bring them all into your country and give them asylum because, let’s be clear, the grant of asylum, while it’s supposed to be temporary, often turns into permanent resident status. And before you make that decision, you have to know who you are admitting. It’s not contrary to our humanitarian instincts to say, yes, we’d like to know what the background of these people [is]. ” Bolton also said that he doesn’t believe destroying ISIS is a priority for Obama and noted that “what that means is, innocent civilians in this country and across Europe are in danger as long as ISIS, or other terrorist groups, as long as they’re privileged sanctuaries remain immune. ” You can listen to the full interview below: Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00AM to 9:00AM EST."

[According to Channel 2, the company detected a hollow pit beneath the ground that it claims may have been dug by Hamas in order to carry out terror attacks in Israel.  The unnamed firm has been investigating areas where people have complained of hearing digging noises underground. The IDF announced Monday that it had “neutralized” a tunnel discovered a week ago and said that Hamas dug it “in order to carry out attacks against civilians. ” The tunnel was the first discovered in Israeli territory since 2014’s Operation Protective Edge. After the war, Hamas vowed to continue using tunnels and rockets to attack the Jewish state. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh told Gaza residents last week at a rally, “Our message to the prisoners is a message inked in blood. The rifle and the tunnel are our commitment. ” Israel has invested an estimated NIS 1 billion (approximately $250 million) toward developing a detection system to locate such tunnels. IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot said on Monday evening that “the IDF puts the tunnel challenge at the top of its priorities and continues investing time and resources to remove the threat. ” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel’s tunnel detection system was unique and called it a “world breakthrough. ” However, IDF officials stressed that even though the detection system was used to discover the tunnel last week, “boots on the ground” and extensive intelligence gathering supplemented the technology."

Breitbart London has reported on how this story made it to the forefront of the media cycle, and exposed the European Union and Wall Street funded groups pushing it. The young migrant states: “Accommodation is not really nice,” before being asked, “Some people would say that people in this country are trying to be helpful. They are giving you accommodation, they are giving you meals, this is a way of you being able to get what you’re entitled to”.

Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution clearly says, it’s the president’s job to nominate justices to the Supreme Court with the advice and consent of the Senate, the Constitution doesn’t say, wait a year and hope for a president of a different party, and trying to flaunt the Constitution is a really funny way for the Republicans to be honoring Justice Scalia’s memory and legacy.   …     So, I think the Supreme Court deserves nine justices, and I think we should demand that the Senate do its duty, and receive and act on whoever the president nominates. ” When asked about fellow candidate Senator Bernie Sanders’ ( ) litmus test that overturning Citizens United would be a litmus test for any Supreme Court nominee of his, Hillary answered, “Well, I would hop that anybody I appoint would understand the grave damage that Citizens United is doing to our democracy.

In contrast to Peyton Manning’s   presser on Monday, the    explained himself in a post at DetroitLions. com:  Let me begin by apologizing for making this announcement via a statement and not in person. While I truly respect the significance of this, those who know me best will understand and not be surprised that I choose not to have a press conference for this announcement. After much prayer, thought and discussion with loved ones, I have made the difficult decision to retire from the Lions and pro football. I have played my last game of football. Let me assure you that this was not an easy or hasty decision. As I stated, I, along with those closest to me, have put a lot of time, deliberation and prayer into this decision and I truly am at peace with it. I also want you to know that I have the utmost respect and admiration for the game of football. It has provided so much for me and my family and I will be forever grateful to the game. With the reality of my decision, I realize there are a lot of people I would like to thank. I must start with my family  —   thank you for all your love and support. I also want to especially thank Mrs. Ford and the Ford Family for all their support over the years. They are tremendous owners and I loved playing for them. I would also like to recognize Mr. Ford, who I was honored to know and play for before he passed away. While it would be hard to name them all, I would also like to thank all of my teammates past and present. I also want to thank all of my coaches who I played for, in particular Coach Caldwell for his support, wisdom and guidance over the past two seasons. I loved playing for Coach Caldwell. There are so many other people I would like to recognize and thank for what they have done for me throughout my career, but rather than risk forgetting someone, I will simply say “thanks” to everyone. And finally, to the fans of Detroit and Michigan. I so appreciated your passionate support over the years and truly enjoyed playing for you. I loved playing in Detroit and will forever be a Lion. My biggest regret is that I wasn’t able to help give our fans a championship. But I do believe the future of the Lions is bright and with the leadership from people like Rod Wood and Bob Quinn, who I have gotten to know over the past few months, I am confident that our fans will soon be rewarded with the championship you deserve. From the bottom of my heart I thank you all for everything. Johnson retires with 731 catches, 83 touchdown receptions, and 11, 619 yards through the air in nine NFL seasons all with the Detroit Lions.

24560,43311,Implicit Bias: The New ’Original Sin’ - Breitbart,Breitbart,John Hayward,2016-10-08,2016.0,10.0,,"Progressives are seething because Republicans are committing blasphemy. [In his   debate, Governor Mike Pence took a swing at one of the Left’s most cherished beliefs: “implicit bias. ”  The police officers who support Donald Trump, he said,  “hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as a reason to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of implicit bias or institutional racism. ” Hillary Clinton sees “implicit bias” not just in the police force, but in “everyone in the United States,” Pence declared. Liberals cannot brook criticism of their precious “implicit bias” theory, which is a new rationalization for totalitarian power, for rule by the progressive Elect whose Ivy League training has equipped them to sniff out the witch of hidden racism. At Slate, William Saletan tried patronizing Pence with a “Dear white people, we need to have a talk” article, urging people of pallor to just relax and accept that they suffer from a psychic disease Doctor Government can treat, but never truly cure: Every day, in one city or another, black and brown parents sit their kids down and talk to them about bias. They explain that at some point, based on the color of your skin, you might be suspected of doing something wrong. Don’t go to certain places, don’t wear certain clothes, and don’t move in any way that might be construed as a threat. Play it safe. White people don’t have to talk to our kids this way, because our color doesn’t attract suspicion. We need to have a different talk, not about suffering implicit bias but about practicing it. Here’s the first ground rule: “Implicit bias” isn’t an accusation. It doesn’t mean you’re bad. It means you’re normal. Animals prejudge one another based on appearance. Human beings are naturally tribal. So implicit bias, as a disposition, isn’t something you learn. It’s something you learn to overcome. Here’s the second rule: When somebody brings up implicit bias, don’t freak out. Don’t get defensive and shut down the discussion. To his credit, Saletan chastises liberals, and even Hillary Clinton in particular, for throwing around baseless accusations of racism, alienating large numbers of people by calling them “irredeemable” occupants of a “basket of deplorables. ” But then he explains that implicit bias is the kinder, gentler version of the   argument, and we’re not supposed to question it, because we are absolved of conscious guilt. We don’t even realize how biased we are  —   it’s something only the credentialed elites of the Ruling Class can perceive with clarity: But “implicit bias” is the opposite of “deplorable. ” The whole point of the theory of implicit bias —  the reason why it can fairly be attributed to everyone —  is that it’s not an accusation of guilt or bigotry. It’s an acknowledgment of the human condition. There’s way too much research on implicit bias to deny its existence. And there are way too many cases that illustrate it. In Tuesday’s debate, moderator Elaine Quijano mentioned Sen. Tim Scott, a black Republican who, as an elected official earlier in his career, “was stopped seven times by law enforcement in one year. ” Other   figures, from former Attorney General Eric Holder to broadcaster Don Lemon to professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. have reported similar experiences. And then there are the men whose final moments many of us have witnessed, in all their horror, thanks to mobile phone videos. You can’t watch the deaths of Terence Crutcher, Eric Garner, and Philando Castile without being shaken. In most cases, what you see in the video, or in direct testimony after the tragedy, is the officer’s fear.   …     The Implicit Association Test —  which you can take on the Project Implicit website —  “shows biases that are not endorsed and that may even be contradictory to what one consciously believes. ” For instance, “you may believe that women and men should be equally associated with science, but your automatic associations could show that you (like many others) associate men with science more than you associate women with science. ” Does that make you a bad person? No. Does it affect your behavior? Probably. Should you own up to your bias and try to overcome it? Absolutely. This is essentially a religious command to confess your Original Sin in exchange for some small voice in negotiating your punishment. The difference is that Christian religion views atonement and penance as individual affairs. But the progressives’ Church of the State wants to stuff entire populations into its confessional at once, and then padlock the doors. Saletan is right about implicit bias theories being more “useful” than   rants about universal   racism  —   as in, more politically useful to statists. It’s easier for the masses to swallow, because it absolves them of conscious guilt, replacing it with subliminal guilt. Also, Saletan says white people don’t have to teach their children to worry about being the victims of implicit bias, because their “color doesn’t attract suspicion. ” That’s not true at all. It’s not difficult to find neighborhoods or universities where white skin color does generate a damaging response.  Part of the problem with this “implicit bias” theory is that it’s so unwilling to come to terms with the idea that everyone makes judgments. In fact, that’s the essence of being human  —   the ability to understand data, share experiences, calculate probability and respond rationally to best protect themselves and their loved ones.  Liberals are trying to clutter up that reality by inventing ever more esoteric justifications for giving themselves more power over everyone’s lives. We’ll doubtless be arguing about police bias and profiling for many years to come, but on this topic, the hard truth is that some portion of that “implicit bias” is logical. The Left is driving our society insane by forcing it to ignore blatant realities of urban crime known by every rookie cop. Likewise, whatever “implicit bias” association of men with science that might be ferreted from the public mind is probably connected to the higher number of male scientists  —   especially male scientists the layman has heard of, which is a rather small group, and its maleness partly is a function of unchangeable history. Despite fervent political assertions to the contrary, there is little reason to believe the continuing prevalence of men in various scientific fields is the result of a nefarious misogynistic conspiracy to keep lady doctors down.  It is wise to become nervous when politicians begin touting vague psych research  —   instead of replicable research or cold, hard numbers  —   to justify their agendas. Every flavor of statism has taken a stab at classifying resistance to its demands as insanity. In the less brutish incarnations of statism, this is done for the precise reason implicit bias advocates so eagerly state: to relieve the masses of individual, conscious responsibility for their fatal flaws. You’re not evil, you’re sick, they tell us. Sickness can be treated. Statists understand that average people view government’s destructive powers as a force that should be deployed primarily against criminals  …     so they teach everyone to think of themselves as criminals. We all deserve to be punished for our   transgressions, fined heavily for unfairly benefiting from implicitly biased society, and controlled lest we prey upon one another. Conservatives learn from history, and so they trust people enough to delegate power and autonomy to individuals of every background. Criminal law is reserved for actions, while thoughts remain private beyond the reach of legislators, cops or priests. Hope for absolute justice is reserved for dreamers and scribblers and is postponed into the afterlife. The past is kept in the past, so people look forward, instead of perpetually fighting over the sins or sufferings of their   .  But statism uses coercive force to impose collective “justice” in this fallen world, which requires unjust treatment of today’s people for yesterday’s sins, so the Elect can build a heaven on Earth by tomorrow. “Innocent until proven guilty” is the   of leaders willing to delegate power, while “guilty until proven innocent” is the justification and tool of impatient utopians, whether they be progressives, socialists or the Taliban.  We don’t need our inept, greedy Ruling Class fooling around with any more victimhood theories, pushing beyond “guilty until proven innocent” to a new vision of “guilty even though you are innocent. ”  Watching progressives try to open this Pandora’s Box of ego and cruelty is like watching clowns juggle dynamite in a crowded school."

[Bill Clinton’s chief of staff, Tina Flournoy, emailed the attached photo of Sanders relaxing by the pool at the DSCC retreat to Brian Fallon, Clinton’s national press secretary.   “Omg,” Fallon responded. “Can we tweet?” asked Podesta. “I think we shd give to NY post,” Fallon responded. Flournoy added that she would send more information about the event, including the people who attended. “Thank you,” Fallon replied. “We are on this. ” The conversation was made public by Wikileaks, as part of the ongoing release of emails from John Podesta’s private gmail account. It appears that the New York Post did not run the story, but that didn’t stop the Clinton campaign from pushing it. The photo was published by Perez Hilton just one day after the Clinton team discussed releasing the image. “I wonder what Mike Bloomberg would think about this? ??” wrote Hilton on his blog. “Bernie Sanders lounges at elite Martha’s Vineyard pool, summer 2015 after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists. ” The following week, several stories appeared in the media questioning Sanders for attending fundraisers for Harry Reid. “For Sanders, campaign finance purity not always possible” wrote MSNBC’s Alex   citing “a guest list obtained by MSNBC” that included “previously unreported are details about who exactly attended those fundraisers. ” “Bernie Sanders: Prolific Democratic Party fundraiser,” wrote CNN’s Eric Bradner on Monday, February 8, announcing that “CNN has obtained invitations that listed Sanders as a host for at least one Majority Trust event in each year since 2011. ” Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton picked up the torch, accusing Sanders of taking Wall Street money that week, ahead of the Democratic primary in New Hampshire. “Senator Sanders took about $200, 000 from Wall Street firms,” Hillary Clinton said during a rally in New Hampshire on February 8. “Not directly but through the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. There is nothing wrong with that. It didn’t change his view. Well, it didn’t change my view or my vote, either. ” Bill Clinton attacked Sanders, referring directly to the CNN story and pointing out that he likely accepted money from Wall Street. “But you’ll never hear her call him a tool of Wall Street,” Clinton said, referring to his wife. Team Bernie did not take the attack lightly. “Bernie appreciates the help he has gotten from the DSCC, whose funds come from millions of Americans’ individual contributions, labor organizations, environmental groups, women’s organizations and others. To say that every nickel that Bernie received came from Wall Street is beyond preposterous,” Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver said in a statement."

Lawrence had just picked up the Best Actress honor at Sunday night’s Golden Globe awards and was was conducting a   press conference when the reporter, speaking with a heavy foreign accent, attempted to ask her a question. “You can’t live your whole life behind your phone, bro,” Lawrence cut the reporter off  . “You just  —   you can’t do that.

The exchange was fiercely debated online, with many saying the actress had publicly humiliated a foreign reporter. Others said Lawrence was simply having a bit of fun. “Let’s not continue the sad but common practice of building people  —   especially women  —   up just to viciously tear them down when we perceive them to have misstepped,” Hathaway added in her Facebook post. “Jennifer is a beautiful, talented, wildly successful, popular, FOUR TIME OSCAR NOMINATED young woman.

25722,44476,Watch: Santa Claus Converts to Islam on Streets of Turkey,Breitbart,Frances Martel,2015-12-31,2015.0,12.0,,"Following a series of protests against the celebration of the new year this week, a radical Islamist party staged a “street play” in the city of Bolu, featuring a repentant Santa Claus converting to Islam and reciting the Muslim profession of faith, or Shahada. [The Great Unity Party (BBP) a small nationalist Islamist political party, staged a sequel to its 2014 stage play in which Santa Claus was shamefully expelled from town by a man dressed as an Ottoman sultan. In this play, Santa Claus faced janissaries, or Ottoman soldiers, who took him to a Sharia judge. Santa was then forced to explain why he was drunkenly rampaging through the streets of Bolu handing out presents:  The judge asked Santa what he was doing, and learned he was celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ by wearing red and consuming alcohol. After Santa argued the public was also content, the judge symbolically asked two people from the public and learned that they indeed found the celebrations agreeable. The members of the public were eventually chastised for their support and Santa lectured on the positive traits of Islam. After admitting that he had “heard that the Turks were barbaric,” Santa was told by the Sharia judge that “there is no room for barbarism” in Islam and agreed to recite the Shahada.  The performance did not reconcile the fact that the man on which Santa Claus is based, Saint Nicholas, was born in Turkey, with the claim that he had “heard” that Turkish people were barbaric. The actors also did not elucidate on why Santa Claus was inebriated while performing his    duties. While alcohol consumption is banned by Islam, it was not unheard of for Ottoman sultans to consume wine. One sultan, Selim II, developed such a reputation for drinking that he was nicknamed “Selim the Sot. ” (He subsequently lost much of the Ottoman empire to Spain while distracted by attempted conquests of Cypriot wine country.) While Santa Claus is globally considered a Christmas icon, he has become increasingly popular as a New Year’s Eve personality among secular Turks. It is not uncommon for moderate Muslims in Turkey to exchange gifts on New Year’s Eve, nor is Santa Claus uncommon as a New Year’s Eve decoration. The fate of Baba Noel, or “Father Christmas,” as he is known in Turkey, in the 2014 version of this street performance was significantly less positive. Hurriyet notes that, in that year, the BBP performers had an unnamed Ottoman sultan expel Santa Claus from Turkey. “Citizens are celebrating because they’re entering a new year,” BBP Bolu Chair Mahmut Alan said. “We’re against the celebration of [new year]. We wanted to express this with a play. ” The play followed multiple days of protests from Muslims complaining that celebrating the new year on the Gregorian calendar is not Islamic. Using the Twitter hashtag “Muslims Do Not Celebrate Christmas,” Muslims protested that Christmas cultural symbols had no place in an Islamic country. They have met some resistance from secular Turks, however. In a column scathingly titled “Out of Pure Spite, I Will Celebrate New Year’s,” columnist Ahmet Hakan condemned the “ignorant” who do not “know the difference between ‘Christmas’ and ‘New Year’s Eve,’” suggesting they “sit down and think: Why isn’t everyone in the world imitating Muslim motifs but using Christian ones?”"
26828,45583,Wilders: Delusional Britain Wants to Ban Donald Trump,Breitbart,Geert Wilders,2016-01-19,2016.0,1.0,," . It is not an English word, but French. However, the word immediately springs to mind when hearing about yet another Western politician or Islam critic, whom some British politicians want to ban from entering their country. Welcome, Donald Trump, in the company of Pamela Geller, Robert Spencer and myself. [Both Pamela, Robert and myself have been banned from entering the United Kingdom. In my case, it happened on February 12, 2009. Two highly respected members of the British House of Lords, Lady Caroline Cox and Lord Malcolm Pearson, had invited me to show my 2008 documentary Fitna to members of the House in a conference room of the parliament building in Westminster. Fitna is a movie, juxtaposing Koranic versed calling for violence with footage of terrorist attacks and other violent deeds these verses inspired.  Fitna, as well as my view that Islam, rather than a religion, is primarily a totalitarian political ideology aiming for world domination, has resulted in several death threats against my person. I am on the death list of   ISIS and the Pakistani Taliban. Since 2004, I have been living under    police protection, but I have a mission: Speak the truth about Islam. However, a   Islamic member of the House of Lords, one Nazir Ahmed, demanded that the then British Labour government ban me from entering the UK. He threatened that he would personally mobilize 10, 000 Muslims to prevent me from entering the Upper House. The government complied and had me banned. Though a member of the Dutch parliament, invited by British colleagues, I was locked up in a detention room upon arrival at Heathrow Airport. Three hours later, I was put on the next flight to Amsterdam. The British authorities said that my “presence in the UK would pose a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to one of the fundamental interests of society. ” My statements as expressed in Fitna and elsewhere were said to “threaten community harmony and therefore public security in the UK. ” Lord Ahmed boasted of his victory in the Pakistani media. He termed the decision “a victory for the Muslim community. ” However, I challenged the ban before the British Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. On October 12, 2009, this tribunal overturned the ban. In March 2010, I returned to London and showed my movie to my colleagues in Westminster. There were no incidents and no disturbances of Britain’s “fundamental interests,” “community harmony,” or “public security. ” The bans served but one goal: It was an attempt to shut me up for speaking the truth about Islam. Yesterday, Pamela Geller wrote on this website that in June 2013, she and Robert Spencer, too, were banned from the UK because their presence was “not conductive to the public good” and a “threat to security of our society. ” It sounded eerily familiar, as did the arguments of those who want Donald Trump to be banned from Britain for advocating a temporary moratorium on Muslim immigration into the US. Fortunately, they did not succeed. When the great Ronald Reagan visited the British Parliament in 1982, he told the British parliamentarians that “if history teaches anything, it teaches   in the face of unpleasant facts is folly. ” This is an advice that politicians everywhere should take at heart. Mr Wilders, a member of the Dutch Parliament, is the leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) and the author of “Marked for Death: Islam’s War Against the West and Me,” published by Regnery. "
27322,46078,Europe’s First Migrant Political Party Accused Of Being Mouthpiece For Turkey,Breitbart,Oliver JJ Lane,2016-05-25,2016.0,5.0,,"The Denk Partij (Think Party) is the first political force in Europe established by migrants for migrants, but it is attracting controversy for their approach to the Turkish regime, Israel and   and the Armenian genocide. [Although the party has existed as a theoretical concept in the Netherlands since 2014 when two Turkish origin Muslim members of the Dutch Labour party were expelled over the influence of Turkish religious organisations in the Netherlands, it has been gaining traction this year. Breaking the threshold of 1, 000 members, they now officially qualify as a genuine political party with two members of parliament, and are eligible for state subsidy.  Eyeing the forthcoming 2017 Dutch elections, the party hopes to tap into the significant migrant origin population of the Netherlands  —   well over one million people in a nation of just 17 million. By appealing particularly to the Turkish population, the largest ethnic group after Dutch in the country, they hope to take at least five seats in parliament. It is reported the party will campaign to establish a national ‘Racism Register’ similar to a sex offenders register, which will catalogue Dutch citizens who do not show sufficient respect to immigrants. But with this increased prominence, comes increased scrutiny. The party made headlines after they compared Dutch   campaigner and parliamentarian Geert Wilders to “Adolf Hitler” and a “cancer”. In return, Mr. Wilders has called the party “a regurgitated piece of Halal meat” reports Die Welt. Speaking in an interview with Netherlands Now, the party’s two MPs were forced to defend their record on Turkey, and a failure to “pursue Western norms and values”. On their refusal to condemn the arrest of a fellow Dutch citizen,   journalist Ebru Umar by the Turkish authorities last month, Tunahan Kuzu MP asked in reply “what’s wrong with saying everyone should abide by the law? “Ebru Umar must abide by Turkish law in Turkey”. Ms. Umar was arrested in Turkey while on holiday, after criticising the Turkish government’s clampdown on dissenting voices and criticism from the press in an article. The Dutch foreign minister later told citizens that if they Insulted the Turkish government and then travelled there afterwards, he could issue no guarantees to render assistance, as reported by Breitbart London at the time. Elaborating on the point, fellow member of parliament and Think Party member Selçuk Öztürk told the website “freedom is quite selective” and that if French   ‘comedian’ Dieudonné M’Bala M’Bala could be arrested for his routines, there was no reason why television satirist Jan Böhmermann shouldn’t suffer the same. The comic is presently being subjected to an unusual trial in Germany at the behest of Chancellor Angela Merkel for penning a satirical poem that accused Turkish leader Erdogan for being a   paedophile. Responding to a blunt question about whether the often repeated criticism of the party that they are “the long arm of Ankara” in the Netherlands is true, the men laughed, saying their membership is growing so fast  —   “100 new members a day”  —   they have no need for foreign money or influence. Mr. Kuzu told the interviewer that even if they did choose to disassociate themselves from the Turkish regime they still would not be trusted by the mainstream, as they had been “discredited” for not “sharing the views of the dominant white crowd”. The party has received a major boost this month, as Dutch migrant television and radio personality Sylvana Simons has joined the group, and stated her intention to run for parliament on their ticket next year. The Suriname born dancer has spoken out against racism and traditional Dutch culture including the annual   traditional character Zwarte Piet (black Pete). The character, who has a sooty black face from helping father Christmas deliver present down chimneys, has been a target of   campaigners for some years. As well as seeking to combat the tradition, Ms. Simons is said to be on a mission to “decolonise” Dutch politics. Local news reports concerns her entry into politics will do little more than “fan the flames of immigrant discontent”."

27419,46175,Farage: Clinton Has ’Lost The Plot’ By Claiming UKIP Funded By Russia,Breitbart,Victoria Friedman,2016-09-01,2016.0,9.0,,"Nigel Farage hit back at accusations by a Clinton crony that the Russian government “openly fund[s]” “ ” UKIP. Mr. Farage observed that the negative campaigning from the Clinton camp is “almost the mirror image” of Remain’s ‘Project Fear’ in the lead up to the European Union (EU) referendum. [Speaking to Breitbart London’s    Raheem Kassam on Breitbart News Daily, outgoing UKIP leader Mr. Farage said that the comments made by longtime Hillary Clinton confidante Neera Tanden were “slanderous” and that anyone using the epithet “far right” to describe people who believe in   democracy “have lost the plot”.   Tanden, who served in the White House during both the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations and is president of the   progressive   Center for American Progress, made the comments during an interview for Politico’s “Off Message’” podcast. The Clinton confidante came out and said that the “Russians are openly funding the   groups, from [Britain’s] UKIP to [French political leader] Marine Le Pen” saying that “there is widespread knowledge among the   parties that that is a rising development”.  Mr. Farage said of Hillary and her “acolytes”: “They have chosen me as a political football in this election campaign” referencing Clinton’s recent rant where she singled out and accused the UKIP MEP of being in bed with Russian president Vladimir Putin. “I’m absolutely thrilled that they’ve done that because it gives me a chance to respond,” he said. “All I can say to her acolyte is that I have never taken a penny piece from Mr. Putin, so frankly what she is saying is slanderous. There is no other way of putting it. ” Adding: “If anyone stoops to the level of using the epithet ‘far right’ to describe people who believe in   democracy, well clearly they are the ones that have lost the plot, not me. ” When asked by Mr. Kassam whether he anticipates a fully negative election campaign from the Clinton camp, Mr. Farage said that there would be an “  assault” and proceeded to draw parallels between the Democratic campaign and the Remain campaign during Britain’s referendum on membership of the EU: “If you look at what I said on that platform [with Donald Trump] in Jackson last week I talked about ‘Project Fear’. “I talked about the negativity that was used by the Remain in the EU campaign in [Britain] which was to tell us that awful things would happen if our side of the argument won, and that all of the protagonists for Leave were bad people  —   demons, basically. “I predicted that that is exactly what would happen in the States in this presidential election campaign  …    It will be an   assault on Trump and anyone that is seen to stand with him or around him. “And we’ll be told that if Trump wins Putin will control America, there’ll be risk of war, there’ll be poverty. “It’ll be exactly the same game. Almost the mirror image of what we saw during the referendum campaign. And you know what? It didn’t work. ”"

28159,46919,Clint Eastwood: Khizr Khan Being ’Exploited’ by Democrats - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jerome Hudson,2016-08-04,2016.0,8.0,,"Legendary   Clint Eastwood chimed in on the feud between Khizr Khan, the father of slain U. S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, accusing the Democratic Party of “taking advantage” of the Gold Star father. [“I think he made a mistake by making fun of the guy’s dead son, but that’s his business,” Eastwood told TMZ, referencing Trump’s remarks about the Khan family. “I don’t think you have to be too politically correct, but you don’t have to be rude to somebody. ”  Eastwood continued: “But also, the guy was being exploited by a political party. That’s no good either. ” Khan spoke at the Democratic Nation Convention last month and launched a   assault on Trump over his temporary ban on Muslim immigration and his past comments on Islamic terror. During his primetime speech at the DNC, Khan  —   who has several ties to the Democratic Party and to the Clinton Foundation  —   said that Trump “consistently smears the character of Muslims. ” “Whether either party does it, exploitation shouldn’t take advantage of some poor slob,” Eastwood said.  The      Academy   made headlines Wednesday after his thoughts on Donald Trump’s war on political correctness emerged in an interview with Esquire. “He’s onto something, because secretly everybody’s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up,” Eastwood said. “That’s the   generation we’re in right now. We’re really in a pussy generation. Everybody’s walking on eggshells. ” Asked if he’d support either Trump or Clinton for president, Eastwood suggested that he would probably vote for Trump because Clinton would continue to promote the policies of President Obama. “I’d have to go for Trump   …     you know, ’cause she’s declared that she’s gonna follow in Obama’s footsteps,” he said, adding that Clinton would be “a tough voice to listen to for four years. ”   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson"
28315,47076,"As Immigrants Flood Italy, More and More Italians Emigrate Out",Breitbart,"Thomas D. Williams, Ph.D.",2016-09-21,2016.0,9.0,,"The number of Italians emigrating from their home country more than doubled between 2010 and 2014, according to a new report, coinciding with a parallel increase in immigrants entering the country. [Italy has been inundated with migrants over the past several years, notably from   Africa, a trend that is showing no signs of abating. What is less obvious but equally striking is the reverse trend in Italians choosing to leave their country in search of greener pastures.  This week the OECD (Organization for Economic   and Development) released its 2016 International Migration Outlook report, which shows Italy among the countries with the most marked increase in emigration in recent years. Italy’s migration outflow grew from 125, 730 persons in 2013 to 136, 330 in 2014, the report states. And in just four years —  from 2010 to 2014 —  emigration of Italian citizens more than doubled. The main destination countries of the emigrants were the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and France. The report also notes that according to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) more than 150, 000 “irregular” immigrants reached Italian shores in 2015, while in the first quarter of 2016 the number of new arrivals by sea showed a significant increase of 42 percent over the same period in 2015. From 2014 to 2015, the number of asylum applications in Italy increased by more than 31 percent, with a majority of immigrants proceeding from Nigeria, Pakistan and Gambia. The report also notes that during 2015 Italy added some 1, 500 new “accommodation spaces” for migrants, which are radically insufficient to lodge the actual number of persons arriving. The Italian government has also established a “Baby Bonus” for   foreign residents, and families with children born or adopted between 2015 and 2017 are entitled to a government stipend of 960 euros per year, for up to three years. The 2016 report begins with a warning: The public is losing faith in the capacity of governments to manage migration. Opinion polls in a wide range of countries suggest that the share of the public holding extreme   views has grown in recent years and that these extreme views are frequently heard in public debates. The report also acknowledges that despite frequent media reports to the contrary, “in most countries, refugee flows are still a relatively small part of overall migration. ” Common concerns among citizens, the report states, include the perception that “migration is unmanaged and borders are not secured,” immigrants “stretch local services” to the detriment of citizens, immigration unfairly burdens the poor by introducing outside competition for jobs, and that many migrants do not assimilate and “may even oppose the values of host societies. ” Follow Thomas D.

That’s recorded history.

[Jose A. Ytuarte, 54, pleaded guilty in a San Antonio federal court to one count of using an interstate facility in aid of an unlawful activity  —   bribery. Yturate admitted to accepting bribes in the form of cash payments from a   in exchange for inputting “materially fraudulent information” into the DPS computer system, according to a statement from the Department of Justice obtained by Breitbart Texas. He confessed that he would input information that an illegal alien was, in fact, a person born in the United States in order to issue a Texas Driver License. In Texas, illegal aliens cannot obtain a license to drive.  In October, Ytuarte was charged with six counts as part of the scheme to issue licenses to illegal aliens, Breitbart Texas’ Lana Shadwick reported. The indictments covered a period of more than two years, from May 2013 to July 2015. The indictment revealed that his   Azeez Mistry, a    San Antonio man, would allegedly charge the illegal alien between $1, 000 and $5, 000 for each license. He would then pay a portion of that fee as a bribe to Ytuarte, the indictment stated. Mistry was also arrested on the charges. He still awaits trial on one charge of transferring false identification documents and four counts of use of an interstate communication facility in aid of unlawful activity. The illegal transactions were scheduled to take place during the lunch hour when other DPS employees were not around. Mistry is currently out of jail on a $25, 000 bond. The issuance of the illegal Driver Licenses took place at the DPS office in Hondo, Texas. Hondo is located about 45 miles west of San Antonio on U. S. Highway 90. Ytuarte now faces up to five years in federal prison. He is scheduled for a sentencing hearing on July 13. If Mistry is convicted, he faces up to 15 years in federal prison. This case was investigated by the Texas Rangers, agents from the FBI, and U. S. Customs and Border Protection officers. In Oregon, illegal aliens are suing the state for the ability to legally obtain a driver license, Breitbart Texas’ Lana Shadwick reported. Familias En Accion and Los Ninos Cuentan and five illegal aliens are suing the Oregon Governor Kate Brown, numerous members of the Oregon Department of Transportation Commission, and the Administrator of the Driver and Motor Vehicles Division for the Oregon Department of Transportation, she wrote. The complaint was filed in early November. In September 2015, Shadwick reported on another DPS employee, this one from San Antonio, who is also charged with accepting bribes to issue Driver Licenses to illegal aliens. Linda A. Perez was a public servant acting as a customer service representative in the DPS Driver License Division in San Antonio from January 1, 2012, to July 8, 2015, Shadwick wrote. Perez was charged with allegedly accepting $ $2, 000 bribes to issue Texas Driver Licenses to illegal aliens who did not legally qualify for those licenses.

29095,47859,Israel: Hamas Fighters Able To Travel Gaza Strip Via Underground Tunnels,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,2016-06-05,2016.0,6.0,,"TEL AVIV  —   Israel is in possession of information indicating that Hamas operatives are able to travel throughout the the Gaza Strip underground utilizing the terror group’s freshly constructed extensive subterranean tunneling system. [The Times of Israel reported:  Information about the tunnel system came from the testimony of a    Hamas member who was picked up by Israeli troops last month after he illegally crossed into Israel from Gaza, the Shin Bet security service said. The underage operative “belonged to the Beit Lahiya Battalion” in the northern Gaza Strip and “most of his activity was in the field of tunnels,” the security agency said in a statement. Through his testimony, Israel learned “Hamas is working to construct tunnels that are linked to combat tunnels throughout the Gaza Strip,” the Shin Bet said. “Hamas has dug an extensive network for moving fighters around the Strip exclusively underground. This network of tunnels includes rest quarters for use by elite units in time of emergency,” the service said. The information about Hamas’s construction of a sophisticated underground tunnel network that snakes beneath much of the Gaza Strip was first reported by Breitbart Jerusalem in November. At the time, Breitbart Jerusalem further reported the tunnel infrastructure mirrors the network built by Hezbollah in Lebanon. The   militia is known to have dug a vast underground tunnel complex replete with war rooms, internal communication lines, ventilation systems, and even missile silos. Israel destroyed a significant portion of Hamas’ previous tunnel system during Operation Protective Edge in the summer of 2014. One source, a member of Hamas’ “military wing,” told Breitbart Jerusalem in November that, following the operation, Hamas enlisted hundreds of terrorists in order to construct an even larger tunnel network. The Hamas source claimed that the terrorist group has succeeded in restoring much of its former tunnel system. He said the next stage involves linking tunnels in north Gaza with those under Gaza City and the south. The source conceded that this requires at least two more years of work. While Hamas’ claims could not be immediately corroborated, Jordanian and Israeli security sources said there is evidence that Hamas is working tirelessly to build a new networks of tunnels. Asked for comment, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces told Breitbart Jerusalem at the time: “The IDF is aware of the fact that Hamas has been working to rebuild its sophisticated tunnel network within the Gaza Strip. “The IDF remains prepared and ready to defend Israel’s borders and its civilians, especially those living in close proximity to the Gaza Strip, from any potential threat should it arise. ” Abu Khaled, a spokesperson for Hamas’   military wing, had no comment on the Breitbart Jerusalem report. In recent months, there have been multiple reports of Hamas tunnels collapsing while the terrorist group was reportedly working to refurbish their underground system. In April and May, the IDF discovered and destroyed two Hamas terror tunnels coming into Israeli territory. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

John Kasich’s steadfast refusal to back Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, they hoped he would do so. [“I do think, at the end of the day, Gov. Kasich and Trump [need to] come together for the sake of the party,” said Ed Anderson, a voting delegate from University Heights.  He added, however, that he believed Trump needed to make the first move. “I do believe that, since Trump is the leader today, that he needs to reach out to Kasich. I do believe that from a spiritual perspective, the Bible says, ‘If you offend your brother, go to him.’ I think there’s been some offensive language. I think that right now, we need to come together as a party and defeat the Democrats and Hillary Clinton. ” Jack Etheridge, an honorary delegate and party donor from Columbus, tried to symbolize party unity in his outfit, sporting a John Kasich for President button from 2000, and a Trump tie  —   as well as a Stetson hat. “I view this as the great synthesis of Republicans coming together, over the principles that I think actually are shared by these gentlemen of limited government, liberty in the classic American sense of the word, and restraint and responsibility among the citizenry. ” Etheridge added that he was “really excited that Republicans have a nominee that presents a very substantive choice to voters. ” He added that he expected Kasich to back Trump eventually: “I’d like to think all Republican officials are going to rise to the occasion and support the nominee. ” Elections were a “team sport,” he said. Earlier in the day, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan ( ) who is also the convention chair, and who attended college at Miami University in Ohio, addressed the delegation’s breakfast event, urging them to rally behind Trump. “We’re all on the same team  —   we all want the same things,” Ryan said, according to Cleveland. com. Asked whether he thought the impasse was hurting Ohio, as Newt Gingrich said earlier Wednesday on CNN, Anderson said: “I don’t think it’s hurting Ohio,” adding, “I just think him and Trump need to come together, and Trump needs to make that initial effort. “We need Kasich to put us over the top.

29771,48535,North Korea Fires Another Missile to Protest South Korea-U.S. Drills,Breitbart,Frances Martel,2016-03-10,2016.0,3.0,,"The government of North Korea has once again fired   ballistic missiles into the sea as a form of protest against new United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang and a   military training exercise being conducted by American and South Korean troops. [The missiles in question are believed to be Scud series missiles, South Korea’s Defense Ministry announced following the launch. Pyongyang fired two missiles over the sea, apparently from coastal Wonsan city, which flew about 500 kilometers before splashing down, sinking. The Japanese government has lodged a formal complaint, as North Korea’s   missiles are capable of hitting Japanese territory, Reuters notes.  This is the second such missile launch this month. On March 3, the South Korean government confirmed that North Korea shot up to six unidentified “projectiles,” believed to be   rockets or missiles, into the East Sea. While the launches did not cause any damage, South Korea considers these incidents “provocations” intended to express an interest in attacking enemies of Pyongyang more directly. In February, following the launch of a   rocket allegedly used to lodge a satellite into orbit, dictator Kim   ordered the military to prepare more rocket launches of a similar nature. This month, Kim reportedly ordered the nation’s complete nuclear arsenal on “standby” before threatening a “  nuclear strike of justice” on the United States. “The indiscriminate nuclear strike   …     will clearly show those keen on aggression and war, the military mettle of (North Korea),” North Korea’s government said in a statement posted through the   Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). Two days later, KCNA announced that Kim   had attended a ceremony celebrating the production of a miniaturized nuclear warhead, allowing Pyongyang to place its nuclear weapons on   missiles. As the KCNA report and accompanying photo are the only evidence proving this claim, it is unclear whether North Korea does possess this technology. In January, North Korea announced it had conducted a successful test of a hydrogen bomb, a claim widely dismissed by nuclear scientists due to the small scale of the quake produced by the blast. Following the latest round of missile shootings, North Korea also announced on Thursday it would nullify all economic agreements with South Korea and sell off all South Korean property remaining in the North. “We will continuously take the planned special measures for hastening the miserable end of the Park   group of traitors by dealing fatal political, military and economic blows to it,” a North Korean government spokesman said. These provocations appear to be aimed at protesting ongoing war games in the region by a joint   Korean contingent of 300, 000 soldiers, 17, 000 of whom are American. The war games, dubbed Key Resolve and Foal Eagle, are the largest of their kind in history and force participants to enact a simulation in which the Kim regime has collapsed and American and South Korean troops must invade the country and restore order. “The U. S. imperialists are warmongers being   on military drills such as missile launch after deploying a large number of modern lethal weapons and equipment in every part of the world,” an article in Rodong Sinmun, North Korea’s state newspaper, alleged Thursday. On Thursday, the KCNA also threatened to “reduce all bases and strongholds of the U. S. and south Korean warmongers   …     into ashes in a moment. ” The international community has, with uncommon unanimity, condemned North Korea’s threats to use nuclear weapons on the United States. “I’d say the young man needs to pay more attention to the North Korean people and taking care of them, than in pursuing these sorts of reckless capabilities,” U. S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said of Kim on Wednesday. In a nationally televised speech, South Korean President Park   called for support for her government against the North. “Now is the time when national unity is important more than ever,” she said, citing not just threats, but evidence of   on South Korean officials and public transportation intended to disrupt South Korean life. Even nations that have traditionally opposed sanctions against North Korea are condemning its increasingly belligerent attitude towards the rest of the world. The Chinese government, which approved the latest round of UN sanctions against Pyongyang, called the current situation on the peninsula “highly sensitive,” with Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei calling for “all relevant parties” to “stop these provocative words and actions. ” The government of Russia has issued a statement warning that North Korea’s behavior could trigger an invasion by international powers. Calling the nuclear threats against the United States “absolutely impermissible,” a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry asserted that “Pyongyang should be aware of the fact that in this way the DPRK will become fully opposed to the international community and will create international legal grounds for using military force against itself. ”"

30390,49155,"Law Prof: Ted Cruz Eligible, but ’Good Faith’ Doubts - Breitbart",Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,2016-01-07,2016.0,1.0,,"Cornell Law School professor William A. Jacobson, who also founded the highly respected Legal Insurrection blog, has addressed the question of Ted Cruz’s eligibility for the presidency, along with several other candidates. [In his analysis, first published in 2013 and highlighted again today, he concludes that Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Bobby Jindal were all eligible —  but that questions may be “legitimate,” since there was so little judicial precedent on the issue.  Jacobson wrote: There is a false construct all around that this is a purely legal question subject to some absolutely right or wrong conclusion. We should all just admit that we don’t really know for sure what “natural born Citizen” means or meant between the points of inclusion and exclusion. So what to do in a constitutionally and politically important area in which there is no clear legal answer? The key to understanding why I reach that conclusion that Rubio, Jindal and Cruz are “natural born Citizens” requires understanding the problem. There are strong arguments in favor of Rubio, Jindal and Cruz each being a “natural born Citizen” as that term most reasonably can be understood through its plain text because they became citizens by birth. Their “natural born Citizen[ship]” also is consistent with the concepts, respectively, of citizenship by birth place (Rubio, Jindal) and parentage (Cruz) from which the term “natural born Citizen” is believed to derive historically. The arguments that the term “natural born Citizen” excludes Rubio and Jindal (because their parents were not citizens) or Cruz (because he was born abroad to a citizen mother only) at most raise doubts. Those doubts, however, never rise anywhere near the level of making the case that Rubio, Jindal and Cruz are excluded. Most of the   are historical conjecture, at best, and rely on speculation not connected to the text of the Constitution or any demonstrable actual intent or understanding of the Framers. In the circumstance of candidates who appear to qualify based on the text of the Constitution and the traditions upon which “natural born Citizen[ship]” is believed to derive, and as to whom there are at worst some doubts raised, I believe the proper constitutional outcome is to leave the issue to the political process. To exclude apparently eligible candidates based on speculation as to what the term “natural born Citizen” might have meant is no better, and I would argue much worse. He adds later that the “Birther” term “has been picked up by many Republicans and conservatives to shut down even good faith questions as to the eligibility of Rubio, Jindal and Cruz. You don’t need to do that. ” Read the full article here."

[“Everyone here hates Gretchen and Megyn,” the talent said in a brief phone interview, adding that hosts from Fox and Friends and throughout the primetime lineup from the   of The Five to Special Report’s Bret Baier to Greta Van Susteren to Bill O’Reilly, Shepard Smith and Sean Hannity are planning to band together and potentially execute contract clauses that allow them to leave if Ailes is driven out.    That being said, if this group —  Baier, Hannity, Van Susteren, Smith and O’Reilly —  can stick together and effectively negotiate as a bloc with whatever other resources and talent they have, they could strap together enough leverage to block Kelly. But that shows how powerful Kelly has become inside a network where most of her colleagues despise her. Ailes has come under fire amid unsubstantiated allegations from Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox anchor, and now Megyn Kelly of The Kelly File that he allegedly sexually harassed them. The only host whom this talent hasn’t personally confirmed as part of a potential mass exodus was O’Reilly. But since Ailes bailed out O’Reilly when he came under fire for a loofah incident that even he would “consider” leaving in a mass exodus. “Fox can have Megyn,” the talent said. “We want Roger. ” The Financial Times confirmed the possibility of a mass Fox News exodus in its reporting. “Three of Fox News’ biggest stars  —   Bill O’Reilly, Sean Hannity and Greta Van Susteren  —   have clauses in their contracts that would allow them to depart if Mr Ailes were to leave the network, the two people briefed on the dispute said,” the Financial Times wrote. “This means a core team of   talent could follow Mr Ailes out of the door. ” This talent added that there is a lot expected to come out about how much Kelly’s colleagues despise her. “The entire building hates her,” the source said. “Nobody cares that she’s upset about a frickin’ hug. ” Specifically, Kelly’s supposed sexual harassment allegation against Ailes was due to a hug in 2006 she didn’t like, according to The Drudge Report. The Drudge Report has also reported on this meeting, but Gabriel Sherman of New York Magazine —  an   agitator in the media —  claims it is not true. Drudge headline is Ailes spin attempt at spin, Fox source in Cleveland says talent has not set meeting to stage walk out. ”Absolutely not”  —   Gabriel Sherman (@gabrielsherman) July 19, 2016,  But, at least one of the anchors who would be in such a meeting has confirmed to Breitbart News that Sherman is wrong —  and that the meeting will take place.  If Ailes were to be driven out by Rupert Murdoch and his sons, then there is already talk among the remaining anchors about getting together a new network outside of Fox News after everyone of the other anchors executes their contract clauses that allow them to leave if Ailes is gone. None of this, of course, is certain and ultimately things may change quickly. But the fact there’s even discussion among top talent at the network of the creation of a new network designed to compete with a Megyn   Fox News is remarkable."
31142,49907,Geller: Muslim Who Plotted to Behead Me Returns to Catholicism,Breitbart,Pamela Geller,2016-09-21,2016.0,9.0,,"The Boston Globe reported Tuesday that “one of the men charged earlier this year with supporting the terror group ISIS and conspiring to recruit others to a ‘martyrdom operations cell’ has agreed to plead guilty in federal court in Boston. [Nicholas Alexander Rovinski, 25, of Warwick, RI, was charged in June 2015 with conspiracy to support ISIS. He was later indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, and obstruction of justice, and faces life in prison. He is slated to plead guilty Thursday. ”  He faces life in prison, but he is only going to get fifteen years. The government is working on a plea agreement with Rovinski, solely in order to ensure that he serves a lengthy sentence. There is a significant difference between Rovinski and his fellow jihad conspirator, David Wright: Rovinski came into the plot later in time, and played less of a role. The deal requires him to receive a sentence of at least 15 years if he pleads guilty to two counts. The maximum sentence for aiding ISIS is 20 years. The first count in Rovinski’s case involves the initial charge against him: conspiracy to provide material support to ISIS. Prosecutors are unlikely to get a guilty verdict on that one, because while Rahim and Wright were both in touch with ISIS operatives in Syria, Rovinski was not. He reportedly has cerebral palsy and walks with a limp, and is very limited in speech and movement. Wright, not Rovinski, was the ringleader of the plan to behead me. The evidence is overwhelming against Wright. In conversations that were recorded by law enforcement officials, Rovinski says very little. Rahim decided that he didn’t want to wait until July 4th, which was initially the day they had chosen for their jihad attack. He, of course, eventually grew so impatient that he discarded the idea of traveling from Boston to New York to behead me, and suddenly decided to kill a police officer in Boston instead. In the conversations, Wright exhorts Rahim to stay firm, very much like the Blind Sheikh in the plotting of the 1993 jihad attack against the World Trade Center. Wright is speaking constantly. Rovinski is hardly heard. I am cautious. Rovinski wrote two letters from prison to Wright. He was still calling for beheading and clearly was a convinced and committed jihad terrorist, eager to murder for Allah. Authorities are hiding the fact that Nicholas Rovinski has left Islam and returned to Catholicism, but I was told this by the prosecutor in the case, Stephanie Siegmann. The prosecutor has told me that he has not only renounced Islam, but done so publicly, and has returned to the Catholic Church. If that is true, he will not be part of the privileged Muslim population in prison, and will not receive the perks they receive (better food, more time outside the cell for prayers, etc. ). He may also be in danger from Muslim inmates who want to enforce Islam’s death penalty for apostasy. The    jihad plot was to behead me, but of course, Boston Globe reporter Milton J. Valencia (milton. valencia@globe. com) never bothered to ask me for comment. It’s typical of an enemedia that is only interested in allowing     voices to be heard. Bottom line. If it were up to me these people would be designated enemy combatants. This is not a law enforcement issue. This is war. But until we get a    who understands this, we have to go with what we’ve got.

31490,50256,"20 Ex-Gitmo Detainees Confirmed, Suspected of Returning to Terror",Breitbart,Edwin Mora,2016-09-16,2016.0,9.0,,"WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   At least 161 jihadists have been liberated from the U. S. military prison in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, during President Barack Obama’s tenure, including nine who are known to have reengaged in terrorist activities and 11 suspected of doing so, reveals a report by the Office the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). [The total 693 jihadists who have been transferred out of the prison under both Obama and President George W. Bush include 208 terrorists who were either confirmed (122) or suspected (86) of returning to terrorist activities, according to the ODNI report, which is released every six months and covers transfers up until July 15 of this year.  That means that, on average, 30 percent of jihadists who are released from the Guantánamo prison, also known as Gitmo, likely return to terror. An estimated 12 percent (20) of the 161 terrorists transferred out of Gitmo under Obama are confirmed or suspected of having returned to their old jihadi ways. Two of the 20 are dead while the other 18 remain at large. Meanwhile, 532 terrorists were released from the prison under the Bush administration, of which 113 are confirmed and 75 suspected of returning to their old habits of terrorism. Of the jihadists released under the Bush administration, more than one third (35 percent) are known or suspected to have reengaged in jihad  —   including 31 who are dead, 43 back in custody, and 114 still roaming the streets. A top Pentagon official told lawmakers in March that Americans have died as a direct result of the release of some Guantánamo prisoners. He did not specify whether the incidents occurred before or after Obama took office in January 2009. In June, current and former Obama administration officials told the Washington Post (WaPo) that at least 12 terrorists released from Gitmo have killed about a   Americans. The officials, to no surprise, failed to mention if any Americans have been killed by the terrorists released under Obama’s watch, only noting that the jihadists who carried out the killings were released under Bush. They neither explicitly denied whether those released under Obama killed any Americans nor did they confirm it. Last month, Obama authorized the largest transfer of prisoners of his tenure as president. 15 Guantánamo detainees were liberated, including two “forever prisoners. ” Twelve Yemeni and three Afghan jihadis were sent to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) a move that brought Obama close to reaching his goal of reducing the detainee population to no more than 56 by the end of summer. Last month, Obama’s   Periodic Review Board (PRP) charged with deciding whether or not a Gitmo detainee is fit for transfer, approved for release a former   explosives expert and trainer who had been deemed “high risk” by the Pentagon. The PRB even conceded that the terrorist still “presents some level of threat” but argued that the risk could be mitigated. In keeping with Obama’s promise to shut down Guantánamo, the PRB has been very active this year compared to 2015 and 2014. This year alone, it has made final determinations 34 times, compared to 9 each in 2015 and the previous year. Close to half of the decisions have been made in favor of the prisoners. The PRB has even cleared for release detainees who had been deemed “forever prisoners,” which the Miami Herald explains refers to “an indefinite detainee considered too dangerous to release but never charged with a crime. ”  According to the   board, the threat posed by    “forever prisoner” Sufiyan Barhoumi can be “adequately mitigated,” in part due to “his lack of extremist views” now that he is a reformed prisoner.   More than half of the 61 prisoners currently being held at the detention center have been cleared for transfer. As the end of Obama’s presidency nears, transfer approvals will likely speed up. The number of hearings this year have already quadrupled compared to those that occurred during the last two years, respectively. Obama has pledged to shut down Gitmo, however, a bipartisan group of lawmakers has prevented him from doing so. Part of the president’s plan to close down the facility would require bringing detainees onto U. S. soil, a move that is prohibited by bipartisan legislation signed into law by Obama himself."
31592,50358,Istanbul attack: Dozens killed at nightclub,CNN,Euan McKirdy,2016-12-31,2016.0,12.0,,"Istanbul (CNN) At least 39 people were killed and at least 69 wounded in an attack in a nightclub early Sunday as they were celebrating the new year, Turkey’s Interior Minister said. ”We are face to face with a terror attack,” Interior minister Suleyman Soylu told reporters.   of the dead have been identified, he said. Of those, 16 were foreign nationals and five were Turkish. US officials also called it a terrorist attack, making it the first of 2017.  Latest developments, The death toll from the Reina nightclub shooting has risen to 39The number of injured is at 69 ”Four of them are in critical condition    one very critical,” says Interior MinisterAt least one gunman still on the run    it is unclear how many attackers were presentNo claim of responsibility has yet been madeUS, Turkish officials say incident is a terrorist attack, Soylu also said that ”the efforts to locate the terrorist are ongoing. Security forces have begun the necessary operations. God willing soon (the attacker) will be apprehended.” Around 1:15 a. m. Sunday, the gunman shot a police officer who was guarding the front gate at the Reina nightclub, killing him, Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin said.  ”He entered the club and attacked innocent people who were there to celebrate the new year. It was a cruel,   act,” the governor said.  There have been no claims of responsibility. The fate of the attacker    or attackers    was also unclear. ’Crazy people shooting everything’ Witnesses in the club said they heard a loud noise, then a security officer told everyone to get out. One victim said he didn’t know how many attackers there were, but he saw one person and hid.  ”I got shot in the (expletive) leg, man,” he told journalists in English as he was taken into an ambulance. ”These crazy people came in shooting everything.” A security camera captured the moment a gunman dressed in dark clothing dashed into the Reina nightclub as bullets ricocheted in the street.  The assailant, who has not yet been identified, opened fire inside the   nightclub in the busy Besiktas neighborhood, according to Turkish   news agency Anadolu.  Besiktas, on the European shore of the Bosporus, is known for its expensive,   class neighborhoods. The popular area had been under heavy police security for new year celebrations.  Ortakoy, where Reina is located, is a vibrant seaside neighborhood that caters to a wide range of people, from the   who party at clubs like Reina, to students who buy stuffed baked potatoes from vendors along the Bosporus.  Reina itself is one of the first clubs to open along the famous strait and remains a touchstone for Istanbul’s exclusive nightlife. It boasts a classic Istanbul view.  Several analysts said the attack looked more like a   attack.  ”In terms of the   aspects of this attack, it’s a youthful place, a bar that’s pretty   in particular to expats. It’s sort of the lively area of Istanbul, and especially on New Year’s Eve night    all of those have hallmarks of   if not directed attacks to maximize casualties and get a lot of news around it,” said Juliette Kayyem, CNN’s national security analyst.  Turkey’s recent tumult, Turkey has endured a recent wave of terrorist attacks, leaving many people wary.  ”This attack is, of course, a horrible development, but not shocking to many Turks who chose to stay inside this New Year’s Eve,” said Aykan Erdemir, former member of the Turkish Parliament. ”Turkey is known to host these big parties to celebrate New Year’s, but this year most citizens were wary of Islamist attacks so they chose to celebrate it at home with their friends.”  He said the attack seemed similar to what happened at the Bataclan, a Paris concert hall that was attacked by gunmen in 2015.  ”This is an attack on the Western lifestyle. This is an attack on Turkey’s secular, urban way of living. And this will simply fuel the ongoing cultural clashes, the ongoing polarization in Turkey,” Erdemir said.  The United States condemned the attack.  ”That such an atrocity could be perpetrated upon innocent revelers, many of whom were celebrating New Year’s Eve, underscores the savagery of the attackers,” National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.  The US State Department said the attacks like this one on its NATO ally ”only reinforce our strong determination to work with the government of Turkey to counter the scourge of terrorism.”  The US Embassy in Turkey warned citizens to avoid the area where the attack occurred.  A violent year, Turkey faces numerous battles across different fronts. Not only has the Syrian conflict and refugee crisis spilled over into Turkey, but Turkey is also battling ISIS and Kurdish militants. Both have staged attacks in Turkey, which is still reeling from a bloody and failed military coup in July. ISIS is suspected in a June attack at Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport that left 44 people dead and an explosion at an August wedding, not far from the border with Syria, that killed at least 54 people. Meanwhile, Turkish security forces clash on an almost daily basis with Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants, mostly in predominantly Kurdish parts of southeastern Turkey. A pair of bombings in Istanbul killed 44 people and wounded 155 others December 10 in an attack by a breakaway group of the PKK. The two explosions occurred after a heavily attended soccer game at Besiktas Vodafone Arena. On December 17, a car bomb exploded near a public bus, killing 13 soldiers in the central province of Kayseri. Three days later, a gunman assassinated Russia’s ambassador to Turkey at an Ankara art gallery. "
31791,50557,"Kentucky abortion bills signed, effective immediately",CNN,,2017-01-08,2017.0,1.0,," (CNN) Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin on Monday signed two bills that put tighter restrictions on abortion, including one measure prohibiting the procedure at or after 20 weeks of pregnancy.  The bills include an emergency provision, making them effective immediately after Bevin’s signature.  The first, House Bill 2, now requires a physician or technician to perform an ultrasound, describe and display the ultrasound images to the mother, and provide audio of the fetal heartbeat to the mother before she may have an abortion.  The text of the bill says the pregnant woman may choose to avert her eyes from the images, and request the volume of the heartbeat be turned down or off. The second measure, Senate Bill 5, prohibits abortions in the state at or after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The bill would not apply in cases where an abortion is required to save the life of the mother or prevent serious risk of bodily harm to the mother, but it does not contain exceptions for cases of rape or incest. The measures passed the   state Legislature on Saturday.  In a press release, Bevin said: ”This is truly a new day in Kentucky,” after signing the two bills, along with five other measures covering matters including labor unions and their membership. The American Civil Liberties Union immediately filed a lawsuit on Monday over the ultrasound measure, and is awaiting a judge’s decision. ”We’ve requested an emergency temporary restraining order,” said Amber Duke, communications director ACLU of Kentucky. The ACLU of Kentucky and the ACLU Foundation filed the legal challenge on behalf of Kentucky’s sole licensed outpatient abortion facility, EMW Women’s Surgical Center, three physicians, and their patients, according to the ACLU. In a statement, Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards said the   ban ”is not just shameful    it’s dangerous for women.” ”A woman has the right to make her own personal, private decisions about her health and medical care. This bill takes that right away,” she said. ”Make no mistake    Kentuckians flat out reject these abortion bans and attacks on reproductive health care.” Ingrid Duran, director of state legislation for the National Right to Life Committee, was quoted on the organization’s website saying the legislation ”sets a tone for the 2017 session in all states: that the unborn child deserves protection.”"
32579,51346,Congress votes to undo 1st of many Obama rules,CNN,Ted Barrett,2017-02-02,2017.0,2.0,," (CNN) The Senate voted Thursday to roll back the Stream Protection Rule, an Obama administration regulation aimed at curbing waste from coal mines from entering waterways but that Republicans complained was an onerous job killer in coal country.  The    vote was largely along party lines though four red state Democrats supported it and one moderate Republican voted against it.  The vote came out one day after the measure passed the House   sending the bill to President Donald Trump’s desk. This is the first of what is expected to be dozens of environmental, financial disclosure and energy rules put in place by Obama in the last weeks of his tenure that the GOP leaders on the Hill plan to undue using a special legislative tool known as the Congressional Review Act. Trump is expected to sign each of the measures. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,   a vocal advocate for the thousands of coal miners in his state, decried the stream rule as a ”an 11th hour parting salvo in the Obama Administration’s war on coal families that could threaten   of America’s coal mining jobs.” Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from   West Virginia, defended cutting the regulation, telling CNN’s Jake Tapper that supporters of the rule ”don’t understand how it works.” ”EPA will have control. So will the Corps of Engineers,” Manchin said, calling the Stream Protection Rule ”needless” and ”duplicated.”  But Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic Whip, called repealing the regulation part of ”Trump’s war on clean drinking water.” ”Shame on us if we decide to eliminate this protection for families and run the risk, the very real risk, the pollution in those streams could cause public health issues,” he said on the floor just before the vote."
32803,51615,Trump discovers the limits of his power,CNN,Julian Zelizer,2017-02-11,2017.0,2.0,," (CNN) When new presidents take power they quickly learn about the reality of governing.  The power of the presidency looks much grander from the perspective of the campaign trail than it does from the White House. Once a president is in office, he is confronted with the power of the other branches of government, Congress and the courts as well as the multitude of institutions and political actors, from reporters to   activists, who can cause problems for any administration.  Historically, we see presidents adjust to the realities of governing. This has been a truism in American politics, often to the chagrin of campaign supporters who believe that the president, by adjusting his agenda, is abandoning promises and core principles. But the best presidents often learn that it is only through compromise, pragmatic adjustment and flexibility that one can be successful in our system of separated power. The question is whether President Donald Trump will make this shift. There are a number of times when new presidents, who tend to be bold and ambitious, are forced to make adjustments once their term starts. One of the most important reasons has been that elections are not really mandates in the United States (so the losers still hold on to some sources of power).  President John F. Kennedy entered office promising a new era, but much of his domestic agenda remained dormant throughout his term given the power of conservative Southern Democrats in Congress. ”The fact is I think the Congress looks more powerful sitting here than it did when I was there in the Congress,” Kennedy said in 1962. Despite all the drama of the 1980 election, President Ronald Reagan still had to contend with a Democratic House throughout his presidency. Every time he tried to move domestic policy to the right, cutting welfare and dismantling programs, he encountered resistant majorities that forced him to curtail his ambition.  President Bill Clinton moved to the center as congressional Republicans regained control of Congress in 1994.  President Barack Obama promised in 2008 to redirect our national security programs fundamentally, but he ended up backing away from closing Guantanamo, escalating our military operations through drone strikes and leaving much of the    counterterrorism program in place.  Circumstances also can change dramatically, and presidents have to change with them. Franklin D. Roosevelt campaigned promising to be a fiscal conservative and keep federal budgets low. But the severity of the Great Depression and the need to boost consumer demand gradually led him to loosen some of those ambitious and open up the nation’s purse strings so to pump prime the markets.  Richard Nixon promised in 1968 to bring an end to the Vietnam War. His ability to do so was limited. Although he would start to pull American forces out of the conflict, leaving the South Vietnamese to do more of the fighting themselves, he continued a brutal and massive bombing campaign against the North Vietnamese that would lead to a national outcry against his duplicity.   George W. Bush campaigned by famously lashing out against Clinton’s proclivity for   and promised to limit US involvement in the world. But then the horrors of   took place. Bush responded by vastly expanding the national security apparatus and involving US military forces in two major military conflicts.  Presidents also change because they learn on the job. The wisdom of governance comes from having a full sense of the issues facing the nation and a better grasp of intelligence    both national security and domestic challenges    where they move away from some of the bluster that was used when campaigning.  Jimmy Carter promised to transform the way that American politics worked but in the end had to work with congressional Democrats who were essential to any legislative victories. George H. W Bush swore that he would never raise taxes in 1988. But when push came to shove and he was dealing with the urgent need to reduce the deficit from the Oval Office, he conceded, angering the right and working with Democrats on a package that raised revenue. Though they were   presidents, their respective accomplishments on the Camp David peace accord and deficit reduction are considered impressive.  There are a few signs that Trump might be shifting on some issues. Scratch beneath the surface of the Twitter blizzard and we have seen him back away from Taiwan, send mixed signals on Israeli settlements and offer some indications that it won’t be possible to dismantle the Iran nuclear deal.  Still he has a long way to go. Overall, he is sticking to the script from the campaign trail and insisting he won’t move away from his core promises. This is what his supporters want. He promised to stop the flow of refugees and that is what he is trying to do. The refusal by an appellate court to reinstate the ban on refugees was a blow to the administration’s policy agenda. Trump was checked, and he is being forced to come up with a game plan for responding. But he hasn’t backed off his message that refugees pose a threat to US national security, even though the evidence suggests otherwise.   He said he would build a wall on the Mexico border, and he is trying to find money to do just that. When Republicans started warning that people were dependent on the Affordable Care Act, he has insisted that even if it might take longer than he thought, the ACA will go. Trump has no interest in changing. As one article in Politico concluded, ”In interviews, nearly two dozen people who’ve spent time with Trump in the three weeks since his inauguration said that his mood has careened between surprise and anger as he’s faced the predictable realities of governing.”  While this might play extremely well with his base of support, it is a model of presidential leadership that is bound to run into trouble.  The courts have already offered Trump the first check and balance. Mass protests have also greeted his decisions and presidency, generating a formidable opposition movement that shows no signs of abating. Congressional Democrats are using what power they have to slow down and delay him. The question is whether and when some Republicans might start to take a stand against Trump, not just with their words but with their votes.    Lyndon Johnson always used to talk about the limits of presidential power. From his long time on Capitol Hill, he felt that Congress would get the best of any president at some point. In fact, Johnson was a president who paid a steep price for refusing to change.  Although he campaigned in 1964 promising to be tough against communism, without going as far as his opponent Barry Goldwater, he refused to change course when officials such as Sen. Richard Russell and Vice President Hubert Humphrey warned him in 1965 that the Vietnam War was a mistake. Instead he got the nation deeper and deeper into a quagmire that eventually undid him and had disastrous consequences.  If Trump refuses to adjust and recalibrate on some key issues, there will be a tipping point where he can’t overcome the institutional limits of his power, particularly given his weak standing in the national polls. When that point comes remains unclear, but history does suggest that even the most imperial presidency, such as that of Nixon, can ultimately be stopped. "
33164,51977,"Indiana teen filmed suspect before double homicide, police say",CNN,,2017-02-22,2017.0,2.0,," (CNN) One of two Indiana teens found dead on a hiking trail last week had taken cell phone video of a man that police believe is a suspect in their double homicide, law enforcement officials said Wednesday. Liberty ”Libby” German, 14, and Abigail ”Abby” Williams, 13, were reported missing February 13 after they went on a hike in Delphi Historic Trails in Indiana and did not show up at a designated   time. After an extensive search, their bodies were found the next day along a railroad bridge near Deer Creek. Law enforcement agents last week released a grainy photo of a suspect: a white man wearing blue jeans, a blue coat and a hoodie. They are still trying to identify him and have said there may be other suspects. Police on Wednesday said the source of that photo was a video German had taken on her cell phone. Officials also released audio of a male voice saying the words ”down the hill,” in the hopes the public might identify the suspect’s voice. ”There’s enough there that somebody could recognize somebody’s voice,” said Captain Dave Bursten, the chief public information officer for Indiana State Police. Bursten praised German for having the ”presence of mind to turn on her video camera,” later calling her a ”hero.” Officials want anyone with information to call their tip line, and said there was a reward of as much as $41, 000. Police said they have more video but they are not releasing it at this time. There is no indication that the case is tied to other murders, said Greg Massa, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s Indianapolis division."

Information about nuclear stockpiles varies from source to source. The information below is sourced to the Nuclear Threat Initiative.   Countries with confirmed nuclear weapons:China    260 warheads,   nuclear capable intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) France   Approximately 290 warheads, India     nuclear warheads, Pakistan     nuclear warheads, Russia   1, 643 warheads on 528 strategic nuclear delivery systems, United Kingdom   Approximately 225 strategic warheads, United States   1, 597 deployed warheads on 785 delivery systems, Countries with unconfirmed nuclear weapons:Israel   Suspected to have enough plutonium for   nuclear weapons, North Korea   It is estimated that North Korea could have as many as 20 nuclear warheads, Countries suspected of developing nuclear weapons:Iran   In 2003, the IAEA released a report about Iran’s secret nuclear development over a period of 18 years. The report confirms that Iran has produced small amounts of enriched uranium and plutonium. Iran claims that it is developing nuclear power for peaceful reasons, its right under the 1968 Nuclear   Treaty.  Iran already has a lot of the building blocks necessary for a nuclear bomb    such as centrifuges, which are the machines that turn natural uranium into the key ingredient, highly enriched uranium, needed to make a bomb. Iranian officials insist their nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes. World powers, including the United States, want to curb Iran’s nuclear program to keep it from developing a nuclear bomb, and Iran is keen to hold on to as much of its nuclear program as it can. Countries that have the ability to build nuclear weapons, but claim not to have any nuclear ambitions:Japan   On November 30, 2006, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso stated that Japan possesses the knowledge and ability to produce nuclear weapons, but has no plans to do so. Countries that have abandoned nuclear weapons or weapons programs in recent years:Belarus   Still has civilian nuclear program. Kazakhstan   Although it inherited nuclear warheads after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan dismantled them.  Ukraine   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine had the third largest arsenal of nuclear weapons. The weapons were transferred back to Russia.  South Africa   Became a ”  weapons state” in 1991. "
33988,52803,White House denies it sought to prevent Yates’ testimony,CNN,Jeremy Diamond,2017-03-28,2017.0,3.0,,"Washington (CNN) The White House on Tuesday rejected allegations that it sought to prevent former acting Attorney General Sally Yates from testifying before Congress in the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation of ties between Russian agents and Trump campaign officials. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday the White House did not seek to block Yates’ testimony and denied that the White House had pressured the House Intelligence Committee to cancel her scheduled testimony. ”I hope she testifies. I look forward to it,” Spicer said during the White House briefing. ”We have no problem with her testifying, plain and simple.” The statement came after The Washington Post reported that the Trump administration sought to block Yates’ testimony before Congress, citing a Justice Department letter to Yates’ attorney that said Yates’ communications with the White House counsel ”are likely covered by the presidential communications privilege.” The letter was sent on the same day that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes canceled a previously scheduled hearing where Yates was scheduled to testify about ties between Trump advisers and Russian officials. Yates briefed Trump’s White House counsel on former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s meeting with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The White House Counsel’s office did not weigh in on the matter of Yates’ testimony, a White House official said. ”There is no letter from the White House because Yates attorney’s letter clearly states a   will be seen as the White House not asserting executive privilege,” the official said. ”So our   clearly allows her to freely move forward with testifying.” Yates’ attorney David O’Neil said in a letter Friday to White House Counsel Don McGahn that Yates would go forward with her testimony and ”conclude that the White House does not assert executive privilege” if he did not receive a response by Monday. Spicer said the White House does not believe executive privilege should be an issue in Yates testifying, which is why McGahn did not respond. Nunes spokesperson Jack Langer told CNN that neither Nunes nor any intelligence committee staffers spoke with the White House about Yates’ scheduled testimony. ”The only person the committee has spoken to about her appearing before the committee has been her lawyer. The committee asked her to testify on our own accord and we still intend to have her speak to us,” Langer said. O’Neil, Yates’ attorney, declined to comment or provide the letter he sent to the White House Counsel’s office when contacted by CNN Tuesday. Yates served as acting attorney general in the early days of the Trump administration until she was fired for refusing to implement President Donald Trump’s order barring travelers form seven   countries. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he was ”aware that former AG Yates intended to speak on these matters and sought permission to testify from the White House.” ”Whether the White House’s desire to avoid a public claim of executive privilege to keep her from providing the full truth on what happened contributed to the decision to cancel today’s hearing, we do not know,” Schiff said in statement Tuesday morning. ”But we would urge that the open hearing be rescheduled without further delay and that Ms. Yates be permitted to testify freely and openly.” Rep. Mike Turner, a Republican on the committee, defended Nunes’ decision to postpone the hearing on Tuesday, saying that Nunes needed to hear from FBI Director James Comey in a classified setting before he could hear from Yates publicly. ”That came well before any of this controversy,” Turner told CNN’s Erin Burnett on ”OutFront.” ”She will voluntarily come. We asked her to. It was the Chairman’s request she be there. The White House isn’t stopping her.”"
34984,53804,"In Hong Kong’s bid for Gay Games, a bid for equality in Asia",CNN,,2017-05-03,2017.0,5.0,," (CNN) For nine days in the fall of 1998 in Amsterdam, Donald Tsim had never felt more free to express himself. He could walk into any restaurant with his partner, walk on any side of the street, with no problem.  Tsim was participating in the fifth Gay Games and was experiencing life outside of the closet for the first time. Growing up in Hong Kong, he hid his sexuality from friends and family. And even though he had lived in London for years, Tsim had never felt comfortable expressing his true self in public until the Gay Games. ”In those nine days it was like an LGBT heaven in a sense that wherever we go we don’t have to worry about being recognized as gay or lesbian, and we didn’t have to worry about being hated or not being served,” says Tsim, who won a bronze medal in badminton at the Amsterdam games. A year later, a family emergency called Tsim back to Hong Kong, and he went back to hiding his sexuality in a society that he says is significantly less tolerant.  Till this day, Tsim has not had an open conversation with his family about his identity. He never had the chance to tell his mother before she died, but he suspects she knew because she had stopped asking if he had a girlfriend. ”My two sisters, my    and my mother knew in secret. My younger sister sometimes buys gifts for my boyfriend,” Tsim, 55, said. ”I think it’s women’s intuition.” Hong Kong’s chance, Now Tsim’s home city is one of three vying to host the 2022 Gay Games, and he hopes that bringing the event to Hong Kong will help challenge the stigma that LGBT communities face in Asia.  ”Hopefully for those nine days Hong Kong will see lots of people holding hands together, maybe kissing, and actually realize it’s OK to be different,” says Tsim.  Hong Kong may seem more progressive than some of its Asian neighbors, but it still has a long way to go on LGBT rights. Despite a growing call for change, Hong Kong has not legalized   marriage and does not recognize overseas   unions.  ”It’s still conservative    that’s the word I’ll use,” Tsim says about Hong Kong. ”They just look at you strangely.”  A UNESCO survey published in 2015 found that about 70% of LGBT students in Asia experienced some form of bullying at school. But the same survey found that ”younger respondents are typically more likely than older ones to call for societal acceptance” of homosexuality. (Comparatively, a study published by the US the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention in 2016 found that 34. 2% of LGBT high schoolers had been bullied at school.) Dennis Philipse, who   the Hong Kong bidding team and is originally from the Netherlands, agrees that the LGBT community is still marginalized and restricted in Asia. Though he does not think that hosting the games in Hong Kong would have an immediate impact on LGBT rights in the region, he hopes that it would raise awareness. ”There will be more visibility of the LGBT community rather than just protesting and doing a parade,” Philipse said. ”For nine days, the barista from Starbucks will meet gay people and the taxi driver will have gay people in his car.” The mission, Founded by Tom Waddell, a gay Olympian, the first Gay Games were hosted by San Francisco in 1982 and are held every four years, like the Olympics. The games’ mission is to promote equality through an international sports and cultural event that is   and inclusive, as heterosexual participants are welcomed as well. Hong Kong’s endeavor for the games started three years ago when Philipse sought volunteers through his Facebook group ”Out in HK” to be part of the bidding committee. He now has more than 40 members, with a number of government and commercial entities throwing their support behind the bid. The 2022 Gay Games host city is expected to be announced in November. Hong Kong is   with Washington, D. C. and Guadalajara, Mexico. Philipse estimates the games could draw as many as 15, 000 competitors and 40, 000 spectators, bringing a possible tourism boost of HK$1 billion. And while he says the event ”is not about proposing gay marriage or making changes,” it does try ”to change the attitude and mentality, which makes it easier to make changes within the community.” ”Things will evolve, and that happens by perception, when people have better perception and attitude towards the (LGBT) community,” Philipse said. Reliving the dream, Tsim’s wish is that he can experience in Hong Kong what he did in Amsterdam in 1998: To walk into any restaurant as an openly gay man, able to express his feelings for his partner without fear of ridicule or judgment and to be treated like any other couple in a restaurant.  ”I would say I’ve lived a positive life with my first boyfriend until he passed away, and that changed me to come out. From coming out and playing in LGBT sports groups, I learned that there’s another life other than going to pubs,” Tsim said.  ”Then I had my first experience at the Gay Games and realized there’s another way to promote inclusion in this world. And that’s why I’m all for the games to happen in Hong Kong.” "
35163,53984,Maria Sharapova beaten by critic Eugenie Bouchard,CNN,Danielle Rossingh,2017-05-08,2017.0,5.0,," (CNN) Billed as the grudge match of the year, Eugenie Bouchard overcame Maria Sharapova Monday after calling her former idol ”a cheater” who should not be allowed to come back on the women’s Tour. The    Sharapova, making her comeback from a   suspension for testing positive for the banned heart drug meldonium last year, was beaten by Canada’s Bouchard,       in the second round of the Madrid Open.  The   Bouchard screamed and jumped up and down after she won her first match in five meetings against the   major winner who had once inspired her to become a tennis player.  If it had been billed as a grudge match it quickly morphed into one of the best contests of this season as both women refused to give each other an inch in a contest full of tension, spectacular baseline rallies and momentum swings. Bouchard prevailed in the end, and their handshake at the net was cordial, with Sharapova saying ”well played.”  Although Bouchard has often said she has few friends on the women’s circuit, she claimed afterward the locker room had been firmly on her side. ”I was inspired because I had a lot of players coming up to me privately, wishing me good luck,” Bouchard said in a news conference, without naming anyone. ”They were players I don’t normally speak to and I got a lot of texts from people in the tennis world that were just rooting for me. I wanted to do it for myself, but also for all these people.” ”Cheater” Although Sharapova’s comeback after serving her ban had split opinion among both male and female players, including   Angelique Kerber and   Andy Murray criticizing tournaments for giving her a wild card, Bouchard has been the most vocal. ”She’s a cheater and I don’t think a cheater in any sport should be allowed to play that sport again,” Bouchard told Turkish broadcaster TRT World on April 25, the day before Sharapova made a   comeback to tennis at an event in Stuttgart, Germany, where she would eventually reach the semifinals.  In October, the Swiss Court of Arbitration of Sport reduced Sharapova’s initial   ban to 15 months on appeal, saying she bore no ”significant fault” and didn’t intend to cheat.  Wild card controversy, Now ranked 258th, Sharapova is in need of wild cards to play events like Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome next week because she didn’t have a ranking at the time of entry as she was still serving her suspension.  The French Open, which Shararapova has won twice, said it will take a decision on whether it will hand her a wild card on May 16.  Her defeat against Bouchard means Sharapova has to reach at least the semifinals of Rome to get straight into the main draw at Wimbledon in June. Bouchard, who decided she wanted to become a tennis player when she watched Sharapova win Wimbledon in 2004, was also critical of the women’s Tour. ”I think from the WTA it sends the wrong message to young kids: cheat and we’ll welcome you back with open arms,” Bouchard said. ”I don’t think that’s right and definitely not someone I can say I look up to any more because it’s definitely ruined it for me a little bit.” Sharapova’s response, When asked about Bouchard’s comment two weeks ago in Stuttgart, Sharapova told reporters: ”I don’t have anything to say    I am way above that.” On the clay of the Court Manola Santana in Madrid, Sharapova initially let her racket do the talking as she took a   lead in the first set before losing a   yet     first set   as she struggled to get less than half of her first serves in and produced six double faults.  In the first set’s seventh game, the former   Russian seemed to lose focus as she mistimed a drop shot at   and let her opponent back into the match by dropping three games in a row.  After Sharapova received a pep talk from her coach, Sven Groeneveld, who told her to ”take a deep breath and get back to your basics,” she broke straight back with aggressive tennis for  . But Bouchard broke once more in the next game and this time didn’t waver as she served out the first set with a huge serve followed by a blistering forehand winner.  The match went to a decider as Sharapova quickly took the second set, breaking for   as Bouchard’s level temporarily dipped.  There seemed to be some psychological warfare going on early on in the second set, as Bouchard turned and smiled after she fended off a backhand that Sharapova had loudly drilled at her from the baseline with a volley. After the third set started with three consecutive service holds from   play was back on serve at   as both got broken. Faced with yet another break point, Sharapova went for broke on a backhand but just missed the line. Serving for the match, Bouchard converted her second match point with a   forehand, her 20th winner. Although Sharapova produced 44 winners, her lack of matches in the past 15 months showed as she made 49 unforced errors, including nine double faults.  ”I think I would be worried about myself if I sat here and said I’m pretty happy with losing a tennis match, no matter who I face, no matter what round it is, whether it’s the first round or final of a grand slam,” Sharapova said in a news conference after the match. ”Today was just not that day. Of course, I’m disappointed. That’s what’s going to make me a better player. That’s what’s going to win me more tournaments and more grand slams.” READ: Why Maria Sharapova’s return has divided the women’s Tour, READ: How doping ban may extend Maria Sharapova’s career to 2020 Tokyo Olympics, READ: Maria Sharapova’s ban reduced to 15 months, Losing streak, Bouchard’s win is all the more remarkable because she hadn’t managed to win a match in     months before she entered Madrid. The    Canadian had struggled with the weight of expectation after a breakthrough season in 2014, when she reached    semifinals at the Australian Open and Roland Garros before going all the way to the Wimbledon finals, where she was overwhelmed by Petra Kvitova.  Having finished the 2014 season inside the top 10, the media attention and extra pressure got to Bouchard in the years that followed as she struggled with a loss of form and confidence and saw her ranking plummet.  After parting ways with coach Thomas Hogstedt in March last year, Bouchard reunited with the Swede who used to guide Sharapova in December.  Although Bouchard started the season with a semifinals spot in Sydney and a third round at the Australian Open, she failed to win a single match until beating France’s Alize Cornet in the previous round in Madrid and even played a   ITF event last month in Florida to regain her confidence.

35722,54543,Locker room confidential - Sharapova’s ’least favorite place in the world’,CNN,Danielle Rossingh,2017-05-29,2017.0,5.0,," (CNN) Maria Sharapova once described the women’s locker room as ”my least favorite place in the world.” Sharapova, of course, won’t grace the clay courts of the French Open    the second grand slam of the season    this year after tournament organizers denied the Russian a wild card, but her blunt description gives an inkling of the tensions that arise within a space that is rarely talked about in any sport. Yet what happens in the locker room, where access is restricted to players and coaches only and where the big stars vie for supremacy, is almost as important as what happens on court. ”There is such a thing as locker room power,” former British Davis Cup player Arvind Parmar told CNN Sport.  Players on a hot streak ”can build a reputation amongst their peers that they’re a man in form,” said Parmar, who retired in 2006 after a decade on the men’s tour and now works as a coach and broadcaster.  Take Rafael Nadal, the   favorite to win an unprecedented 10th French Open title after a   run on the red clay this spring in Europe. The aura is back.  ”Right now he has a huge amount of locker room power in the fact that if you were drawn against him, he is already a break up in both sets,” said Parmar.  ”It’s pretty intimidating knowing you’ve got to play one of the top guys who are in form like Nadal at the moment. Psychologically, there is a huge advantage to have,” he added. READ: How much will tennis miss Serena Williams? READ: Novak Djokovic hires Andre Agassi, Rituals, Craig O’Shannessy was coaching at the French Open in 2013 when he was nearly run over in the locker room by a player sprinting past at full speed. ”If I had been walking out half a second earlier we would have had an awful collision, and I was a little angry,” said O’Shannessy, who is also the strategy expert for Wimbledon, the Australian Open and the men’s ATP World Tour. ”I was wondering who this guy was. And I look back and it was Rafael Nadal.” The    Spaniard’s   routine includes a long series of rituals that include taking a freezing cold shower to invigorate himself before putting on his headphones while his trainer bandages his feet. After putting grips on all six of rackets himself, Nadal will then wet his hair before putting on his bandana before using the cramped space of the locker room to do a series of short, violent bursts of exercise.  ”It is very intimidating,” O’Shannessy said. ”If you are an opponent of his, and seeing this   ritual of maximum intensity, a lot of times the matches can be won or lost right there.”  As a coach, O’Shannessy would advise a player ”to go somewhere else where he’s not. Go to another locker room. Don’t let that have an impact on you, don’t watch it.” Friendships, Perhaps the most gladiatorial of all individual sports besides boxing, tennis is unique in the way all players have to share the same facilities as their biggest rivals, even on finals day.   Given what’s at stake, you’d expect the locker room to be a place of heightened tension and anxiety where it’s hard to make friends.  READ: Sharapova return leaves women’s Tour divided, READ: Sharapova beaten by most vocal critic, ”It’s tough for me to imagine being friendly and having a friendship with someone and then the next day going out on the court and trying to beat them,” Sharapova explained in an interview with US broadcaster Larry King in 2013. ”I don’t think that’s fair.” Sharapova’s reluctance to make friends may explain some of the criticism she has received from her fellow players when she returned from a   doping ban last month. Although former world No. 3 Pam Shriver said she was ”one of the more social, talkative players,” with lots of friends on tour, the American pointed out some of the great champions of the past also needed a bit of distance. ”I can tell you that Steffi Graf and her locker room demeanor is not unlike what I think Maria Sharapova’s is like,” Shriver, an ESPN broadcaster who won 20 major doubles titles with Martina Navratilova between 1978 and 1997, told CNN Sport. ”Which is to keep a very strong, isolated boundary and you are just in your own preparation, you are in your own world and you don’t really need anybody to prepare other than your team.” ”Even Chris Evert for a while really felt like she needed to isolate in order to get the best out of herself,” Shriver added.  It’s not just the women who struggle with the boundaries of friendships in the locker room.   Andy Murray and   Novak Djokovic were firm friends when they played each other in the juniors but put their friendship on hold when they started to contend for titles on the men’s tour.  Pecking order, Although the French Open locker rooms are luxurious with comfortable couches and wooden lockers, nothing beats Wimbledon, where attendants draw players an ice bath to aid recovery or a warm bath to relax in one of its marble tubs and even serve tea and biscuits.   The bigger the star, the more privileges they get when it comes to locker room perks, according to Parmar. ”The locker room attendants are the same people each year and once a player has a locker they then try and give those players that same locker each year,” said Parmar. To mark the retirement of   major winner Graf, French Open organizers engraved her playing record on the door of her locker, No. 19, and gave it to the German as a gift. ”And to illustrate just how irreplaceable Graf is, the tournament locker room now has an 18b, but no No. 19.. .” Roland Garros said on its website.  Although the French Open has two locker rooms, one at the main Court Philippe Chatrier and one at the Court Suzanne Lenglen, its second showcourt, nowhere is the pecking order between the sport’s superstars and its journeymen more clear than at Wimbledon. The All England Club has a separate locker room inside Centre Court for the top 16 seeds and what is called the North and South men’s dressing rooms for the other players. ”That main locker room was a lot smaller and lot more intimate, but you really got the sense it was a special club to be part of,” said Parmar. In 2001, the North and South locker room was being used by eventual champion Goran Ivanisevic, who had slumped so much in the rankings he needed a wildcard to enter the main draw. As he advanced through the tournament, Ivanisevic was offered an upgrade to the top 16 locker room. He refused.  ”He didn’t want to change the routine,” Parmar said. ”Whenever he played, there was an amazing buzz up in our locker room. Everyone would be watching his matches and we almost thought he was one of us.” Practical jokes, Although most players are creatures of habit and the locker room is a den of superstitions, there is also time for humor. One of the biggest practical jokers on the men’s tour was the now retired Frenchman Michael Llodra, who once hid naked in the locker of Ivan Ljubicic in Miami in the hope that some of the Croat’s good form would rub off on him.  Visit cnn.  for more news and videos, ”These lockers in Miami aren’t that big, but he climbed in there and the guy opened his locker, and he was there, cramped,” Parmar said. ”It was just comical.” ”Even with all the rivalries, you’re one big family, because you do see each other week in, week out,” Parmar said."
36100,54923,Latinos thrive in radio and TV despite Trump ,CNN,,2017-06-10,2017.0,6.0,," (CNN) While President Donald Trump was focusing on building a wall along our southern border, a sound barrier across the Western Hemisphere was being shattered by the Latin beat wafting across the airwaves.   Reigning on Billboard’s Hot 100 singles chart at No. 1 is the   song ”Despacito (Remix),” featuring Justin Bieber and Puerto   American singers Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee. Not since ”Macarena” dominated the coveted slot in 1996 has a Spanish language song soared and reached such crossover acceptance. ”Despacito” was already a   hit, but it was the remix with Bieber that hurled the song smack into the mainstream.   At a time when many US Latinos are feeling marginalized and under attack from political rhetoric on the right and ineffective representation on the left, Spanish pop songs that galvanize an American audience are a recognition that Latinos are part of the American landscape. In addition, a wellspring of Latino TV roles has begun to counter inflammatory images with contemporary Latino profiles.     After four seasons, Hulu’s ”East Los High” is ending its run. The teen drama, set in a predominantly Latino high school, became a hit in Atlanta with   millennials before it became   TV in Los Angeles. Youth, regardless of race and ethnicity, responded to the series because of its authentic characters and relatable narratives.   When Carlos Portugal and Kathleen Bedoya created the show, they gave actors Danielle Vega and Vanessa Vasquez a platform from which to both receive a 2015 Daytime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Performer in a New Approaches Drama Series, while breakout performances led Gabriel Chavarria to key roles in ”Lowriders” and ”War of the Planet of the Apes.” Another actor from ”East Los High,” J. D. Pardo,  was cast in the principal role in FX’s ”Sons of Anarchy” spinoff ”Mayans MC.” The writers’ room for ”East Los High” included predominantly Latino and female writers, such as Evelina Fernandez, Charo Toledo, Luisa Leschin and Nancy De Los Santos. Just as Showtime’s ”Resurrection Blvd.” did 17 years earlier, a multiyear,   show and cast yields experienced creators, writers, actors, producers and skilled tradecraft professionals. Shows like ABC’s ”Cristela” and CW’s ”Jane the Virgin” laid the foundation for a predominantly Latina cast to reboot Norman Lear’s ”One Day at a Time” on Netflix.  America Ferrera’s   comedic role in NBC’s ”Superstore” expanded the comedic range for Latinas by providing the yang to Sofia Vergara’s    ying in ABC’s ”Modern Family.”   Latino acting leads have grown substantively in the area of scripted dramas. Wilmer Valderrama’s standout performance as the   and cocky Nick Torres on the 14th season of CBS’s ”NCIS”  —   the    US   television scripted series    reflects the cumulative advancement that Latinx actors have made on many   television shows across networks, cable and streaming services. Last week, actress Elena Verdugo passed away at age 92  Many remember Verdugo for her role, from 1969 to 1976, as Consuelo Lopez on ABC’s ”Marcus Welby, M. D.” It’s hard to believe that, at the time, Elena’s supporting role was the most visible and recognizable Latina character ever on seen American TV.  It would take 28 more years before another actress, Eva Longoria, would have that distinction, as Gabrielle Solis on ABC’s ”Desperate Housewives”    although actresses Sonia Manzano, Rita Moreno, Lynda Carter, Constance Marie and Jessica Alba also had prominent TV roles during that time.  Although the struggle to include more Latinx characters and story lines to television content has long been documented, the solution has always been to create programming that affords emerging talent an opportunity to build their craft, either behind or in front of the camera.   At times, that opportunity has been the strongest when members of two different marginalized groups work together. Under John Ridley’s    a black screenwriter and film director    leadership and direction, ABC’s ”American Crime” crafted complicated and multidimensionally inclusive characters. Benito Martinez’s   performances in all three seasons    but, in particular, the most recent one    portrayed a Mexican   bilingual dad who crosses the border without authorization to retrace his missing son’s path to the US Ridley tackled immigration by juxtaposing hate and humanity. ”American Crime’s” final season accomplished what armies of political talk show pundits could not: It imagined immigration in an understandable and contextual media narrative. Like Alejandro González Iñárritu’s film ”Amores Perros,” ”American Crime” developed overlapping and intersecting hot button and taboo topics that contrasted American lives trying to survive an unforeseen event. Ridley showcased Latino actors by gifting their characters with integrity, compassion, courage, complexity, grit, determination, flaws and frailty. The show showcased Martinez’s acting chops, as well as those of actors Richard Cabral, Elvis Nolasco and Johnny Ortiz, all of whom emerged as polished, experienced and   actors. Ridley, like Norman Lear almost a half century before, mashed up contemporary content with diverse characters. As   shows continue to be crafted to include Latinx,   content on Univision (”La Candidata”) and Telemundo (”El Señor de los Cielos”) have upped the quality and made their telenovela content more appealing and relevant to US audiences. This comes on the heels of Netflix’s sweeping and successful original Spanish programming and independent distribution that includes ”Narcos,”  ”Club de Cuervos,” ”Juana Ines,” ”Ingobernable,” ”Velvet,” and ”Gran Hotel.”  Cristela Alonzo (ABC’s ”The Gospel of Kevin”) John Leguizamo (ABC’s ”Salamander”) Ian Gomez (CBS’ ”Living Biblically”) and Rosie Perez (NBC’s ”Rise”) return to television’s 2017 fall schedule. Critics are already calling ABC’s ”The Good Doctor,” with Nicholas Gonzalez, a bona fide hit. And yet, new shows like” S. W. A. T.,” set in Los Angeles, have no Latinx series regulars similarly, Latinos, who represent 11% of the military, are not cast in CBS’ show on US Navy SEALs. As Justin Bieber sings ”[p]asito a pasito,” which means one step at a time, the TV doors have begun to swing open in the same manner. Now, if only film studios could follow the lead of music and networks. "
36318,55141,Finsbury Park -- a closer look,CNN,,2017-06-19,2017.0,6.0,," (CNN) The area of north London where a vehicle ploughed into worshippers who had left a nearby mosque early Monday is vibrant, ethnically diverse and home to a strong Muslim community. On Fridays, worshippers can be seen heading to and from the several mosques in the area. On days when Arsenal football club hosts home matches at the nearby Emirates stadium, the streets around Finsbury Park’s transit interchange throngs with fans. As with many areas on the fringes of central London, gentrification has seen the arrival of gourmet coffee shops and refurbished bars. The local MP is Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the UK’s main opposition Labour Party. Cynthia Vanzella, a witness to the van attack, describes the area as a mixed community, with people from many different countries and cultures. ”We all live perfectly fine,” she said. ”I never saw anything nowhere close to this happen at all. We have a church in one road, an evangelic church in another and a mosque across the road as well. And everybody . .. lives fine. We never had any problem at all in here.” ’People are extremely sad’ Another witness, Ratib   told CNN: ”There’s a lots of people from Nigeria, from Tunisia from Morocco, from the Arab countries. Lots of people as well from like Somalia. It’s a very strong Muslim community in this area and what’s happening today is I think the people must be extremely, extremely sad,”   said. Islington’s Seven Sisters Road area    the scene of the attack    is home to at least four mosques, and would have likely been filled with worshipers leaving   taraweeh prayers    special prayers during the holy month of Ramadan    and heading back towards the Finsbury Park Underground station. The Emirates Stadium close by, while further up Seven Sisters Road is the green space of Finsbury Park, which opened in 1869 and gives the area its name.  The largest mosque in the area is Finsbury Park Mosque, an unassuming   redbrick building near the station, which opened in 1994. At one time it was associated with extremism, due to its links with   radical cleric Abu Hamza   in the early 2000s.   who was the mosque’s imam from 1997 to 2003, was later extradited to the United States, where he was convicted of supporting al Qaeda and Taliban terrorists, and sentenced to life in prison in 2015. Since then it has reopened under new management and CNN correspondent Phil Black says over the past 10 years it has ”worked very hard at becoming a healthy, active member of the community.”  In 2014, Finsbury Park Mosque became one of only three faith organizations    and the first Muslim organization    to achieve the VISIBLE standard. The standard recognizes independent community organizations that deliver services for local people and build partnerships with other groups. It covers all aspects of running a community building including the procedures and policies used by trustees or management to run the organization.  Appeals for calm, The Muslim Council of Britain, an advocacy group for the country’s Muslim community, said in a Monday tweet that the incident took place near the Muslim Welfare House    on the opposite side of the road    not outside the Finsbury Park Mosque itself. In a statement, Muslim Welfare House condemned the attack and appealed for calm. ”We have worked very hard over decades to build a peaceful and tolerant community here in Finsbury Park and we totally condemn any act of hate that tries to drive our wonderful community apart,” CEO Toufik Kacimi said. ”All of our efforts should be towards getting justice for the victims and ensuring our community stays the diverse, tolerant and welcome place we know it to be.” Corbyn expressed sympathy in the wake of the vehicle collision. ”I’m totally shocked at the incident at Finsbury Park tonight. I’ve been in touch with the mosques, police and Islington council regarding the incident. My thoughts are with those and the community affected by this awful event,” he said on Twitter."
36843,55671,Clintons return to political storm,CNN,Maeve Reston,2016-07-03,2016.0,7.0,," (CNN) The optics could hardly be worse. Three weeks from the Democratic National Convention as most Americans are jamming airports, firing up the grill or looking forward to Fourth of July fireworks, Hillary Clinton was at FBI headquarters    for a full three and a half hours    answering questions about her use of a private email server for official business as secretary of state. Though not unexpected, that news broke in the context of a fresh political storm. In a stunning act of bravado, her husband, former President Bill Clinton, met privately with Attorney General Loretta Lynch aboard her plane Monday while both were on the tarmac at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.  Clinton’s   questioning by the FBI Saturday signaled that the agency is wrapping up its probe into whether she or her staff did anything illegal by setting up a private email server while running American foreign policy. Sources tell CNN the expectation is Clinton will not face charges. Bill Clinton says he regrets Lynch meeting, But when paired with Bill Clinton’s apparent misstep    meeting with Lynch at a time when his wife is under investigation    the two events once again fuel the narrative that the Clintons operate under different rules than the rest of the political world. The stakes of the next several weeks before Democrats officially make Clinton their nominee are much higher now.  Republicans pounce, And Republicans, who have spent weeks grappling with the drama kicked up by their own presumptive nominee Donald Trump, are ready to pounce. Trump on Sunday said there’s no innocent explanation for the airport tarmac meeting between Bill Clinton and Lynch. ”Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U. S. A. G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.” He quickly added, ”Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U. S. A. G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged  corrupt!” Trump tweeted.  That followed his call Saturday for criminal charges against Clinton. ”It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton,” Trump tweeted Saturday. ”What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!” Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus also blasted the Clintons in a statement issued around the same time.  ”The American people need to have confidence that the Obama Justice Department is conducting a fair and impartial investigation, but when the attorney general meets secretly with Bill Clinton just days before Hillary’s interrogation is conducted discreetly over a holiday weekend, it raises serious concerns about special treatment,” Priebus said. At a time when she must sharpen her arguments against Trump as unfit for the Oval Office, Americans were once again reminded of Clinton’s greatest political liability: questions about character and honesty that swirled around her and her husband during two terms in the White House in the 1990s and have endured to this day. Clinton campaign says it raised $68M in June, The events of the last week also reminded voters of the Clintons’ apparent Achilles heel    a tendency to steer into   political squalls that blow up just at the moment they seem to be heading into clear political waters. The timing seemed especially unfortunate for the Clinton campaign given that the presumptive Democratic nominee seemed to be gaining her footing after a long and bruising primary battle with Bernie Sanders. In recent weeks, Clinton has reveled in the unforced errors of Trump’s campaign while expanding her lead over the real estate magnate in national polls.  Clinton’s campaign offered few details about her visit to FBI headquarters Saturday, but hastened to note that the meeting about her ”email arrangements” was voluntary. Still, it thrust her potentially precarious legal position back into the news at a time when Trump has been building his case against her on character    calling her ”Crooked Hillary” and claiming that she should be thrown in jail because of her use of a private server.  Earlier on Saturday, Trump stirred his own controversy by tweeting ”Crooked Hillary    makes History” with an image of her face surrounded by money and a   star that for some evoked the Star of David imprinted with the words ”most corrupt candidate ever.” After a burst of outrage on Twitter, the tweet was deleted and replaced with a similar missive where message ”most corrupt candidate ever” appeared in a red circle, rather than a   star. Historically low approval, On a day when the most of the political world was checked out, Clinton’s FBI visit and Trump’s Twitter blunder were a reminder that the 2016 election pairs up two candidates with historically low personal approval ratings, who sometimes seem as likely to hamper their own campaigns as damage their rival. The potential political damage of the FBI probe of Clinton    and the extent to which Trump may use it against her    will depend to a great extent on how quickly the FBI wraps up its investigation into email practices and what its findings are. Sources familiar with the investigation have previously told CNN the Justice Department’s aim was to wrap up before the Republican and Democratic conventions this month. While many Democrats hope that’s the case, the week’s events brought a renewed focus on Bill Clinton, and the question of whether he ultimately becomes a liability to her campaign. The former President has been a far more disciplined and scripted campaigner for his wife this cycle than he was in 2008. Notably, he has studiously avoided responding to Trump’s provocations about his impeachment, his past conduct with women and his marriage. Apart from a few   with Sanders supporters and hecklers, the 42nd President has avoided the   rages and political meddling that were a distraction for his wife’s previous presidential campaign. He had largely repaired his relationship with the Obama administration after their tough combat on the campaign trail eight years ago    and won the admiration and gratitude of President Barack Obama for his role as ”  ” during the 2012   campaign. But he put the administration in a very difficult spot this week by popping on to Lynch’s plane to talk, she said, mostly about golf and grandchildren. The impromptu meeting was a surprising move for an   who is widely considered to be one of the brightest political minds of his generation —  creating the perception that he may have used his power and influence to arrange a meeting with an official who could be integral in the investigation of his wife. Why was Bill Clinton in Phoenix the day he met with Lynch? Forced to defend the meeting Friday at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Lynch said she ”certainly wouldn’t do it again, because I think it has cast a shadow over what it should not, over what it will not touch,” Lynch said.  She emphasized that the meeting with Bill Clinton ”does not have a bearing on how this matter will be reviewed and resolved” and said she would accept the determinations and findings of the FBI in their probe of Clinton’s email use.  ’Would not do it again’ An aide to Bill Clinton said in a statement Saturday that ”the President’s conversation with the Attorney General was unplanned and was entirely social in nature. But recognizing how others could take another view of it, he agrees with the Attorney General that he would not do it again.” In the   Clinton’s meeting with FBI agents and her husband’s march across the tarmac at Phoenix airport to Lynch’s jet hand ammunition to Trump    who has in recent weeks struggled to overcome his own blizzard of missteps.  It won’t matter to Trump that the Clinton campaign says her session at FBI head quarters was voluntary. The billionaire will conjure up visions of the former secretary of state being grilled by the Feds, to stoke suspicion of wrongdoing and to recall the depositions, investigations and the scandals that scarred the Clinton administration during the 1990s and which he has suggested voters have no desire to revisit. ”Hillary Clinton has got to go to jail,” Trump told supporters in California last month, in one example of the way he has latched onto the email server drama to raise doubts about Clinton’s character and legitimacy as a presidential candidate. ”Folks, honestly, she’s guilty as hell.” The road to 270, It may not be possible to assess the full impact of Bill Clinton’s perceived intervention until after the FBI has delivered its verdict. If, Clinton, as many Washington insiders expect, escapes indictment over the email issue, the former President’s actions are certain to be enlisted by conservatives who have already been framing a case that the probe is a set up orchestrated by the Obama administration. Austan Goolsbee, a former senior member of Obama’s economic team, told CNN Saturday that Trump would do everything possible to exploit the new developments in the   Clinton email saga. ”He will say, ’Well she was interviewed by the FBI this weekend,’” he said. Goolsbee added: ”Until we get to the point that the FBI releases their report or makes a recommendation or whatever they are going to do . .. I think Donald Trump is going to keep saying that to try to take the focus off the things he’s said.” The email server controversy had hurt Clinton long before her session at the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington on Saturday. In a   poll in June, 67% of people said that she had made a mistake in setting up the system as secretary of state. The drama has clearly weighed on Clinton’s support in crucial electoral battlegrounds. A Quinnipiac University poll last month found that by margins of between 8 and 14 points, voters in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania are skeptical of Clinton’s trustworthiness. But Bakari Sellers, a CNN commentator who is also a Clinton supporter, said the interview would come as a relief for Clinton’s camp    offering the prospect that the email saga that has dragged behind her campaign was finally drawing to a close. He also argued that the fact that Clinton’s lawyers had allowed her to sit with the FBI meant it was unlikely that they believed she had any genuine legal exposure. But Sellers admitted on ”CNN Newsroom” that the former president’s meeting with Lynch amounted to ”bad optics” that had put his wife’s campaign on defense."
37111,55941,South Sudan: President Kiir orders ceasefire ,CNN,Deborah Bloom,2016-07-11,2016.0,7.0,," (CNN) South Sudanese President Salva Kiir on Monday demanded an immediate end to the fighting between his soldiers and those loyal to his rival vice president. The civil disputes have left more than 150 dead across the capital city of Juba since fighting broke out on Thursday.  Following an overnight lull, fighting resumed Monday morning with the sound of gunfire blasting through parts of Juba, according to Shantal Persaud, acting spokeswoman for the U. N. Mission in South Sudan. The fighting threatens to throw the newest formed nation in the world back into a civil war. The U. N. Security Council expressed its readiness to provide more security on the ground, and is calling upon nearby nations to prepare troops for possible deployment, said U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power. Fighting first broke out Thursday with skirmishes between the Sudan People’s Liberation Army, loyal to Kiir, and soldiers backing Vice President Riek Machar. The resurgence came after a halt the day before when the country celebrated the fifth anniversary of its independence from Sudan. ”What we may be seeing is a total breakdown of command and control in Juba,” said Kate Almquist Knopf, director of the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. ”We need to watch carefully for whether a cycle of reprisal killings by either side begins in the next few days.” The United States and India are evacuating nonemergency staff from their missions in South Sudan as bloody violence in the capital spirals, leaving scores of people dead, including two Chinese U. N. peacekeepers. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it ceased almost all its operations in Juba on Friday due to fighting. Persaud, the U. N. mission spokeswoman, talked to CNN by phone from a U. N. compound, taking cover in the bathroom as gunfire was exchanged outside the complex near Jubal’s airport. Shots were also heard outside a U. N. civilian protection facility in the city’s southeast. Why they’re fighting, The Security Council, which held a closed door meeting Sunday, expressed ”shock and outrage” at attacks on civilians and U. N. compounds, saying they may constitute war crimes. It called on Kiir and Machar to control their respective warring forces, prevent the spread of violence and commit themselves to implementing a ceasefire and peace agreement. Machar said that soldiers on his side had been bombarded from helicopters. An estimated 83, 000 people are seeking refuge in churches, schools and outside the peacekeeping base of the U. N. mission, according to the United Nations. Humanitarian workers have been stopped and threatened at checkpoints when trying to deliver assistance, unable to reach the most needy, according to Chaloka Beyani, the U. N. special rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons.  International law requires that parties in conflict allow humanitarian workers to have safe passage, he said. The threats to humanitarians in the western city of Wau are unconscionable, his office said in a statement Monday, stressing that leaders of armed groups and forces must tell their troops to back off. Two weeks ago, fighting in Wau displaced at least 70, 000, according to the United Nations. ”I am deeply disturbed by the renewed outbreak of violence in South Sudan, a country which marked its fifth anniversary of independence on Saturday with gunfire instead of celebration,” Beyani said. ”Everything came to a halt because there was too much confusion, too much shooting, too much commotion in town. Checkpoints are making movements impossible,” said Jurg Eglin, head of the Red Cross mission in the country.  Stranded, hungry and scared, Thousands of people took shelter at the World Food Programme’s compound, also close to the fighting, said Challis McDonough, the organization’s senior regional spokeswoman. The compound ”is designed for about 100 people and it’s got something like 3, 000 in it right now,” McDonough said. She said the fighting might hinder distribution of food with the country’s main center of coordination in lockdown.  ”The humanitarian needs are acute in some parts of the country, and we are trying to make sure we can continue that support, but we need to make sure it is in a way that is as safe as possible for our staff and partners,” she said. A Kenyan nongovernmental organization worker trapped in a hotel talked to CNN online. CNN is not able to provide his name because he is not authorized to speak to media.  ”We are stranded in hotels,” he said. ”All we can hear is the fighting outside. There is a perennial lack of supplies, food, water, fuel for the generators, and all we know is that the airport is closed and we cannot access it to fly out. The roads are being manned by soldiers who are robbing and harassing anyone who dares approach them. ”We keep thinking the fighting has stopped,” he continued, ”but even after two hours of calm, it is followed by hours of gunfire and shelling.  ”Kenyans who are stuck here are ready to pay for their bus and air tickets out of Juba but the border is closed and airlines have canceled flights. The only way out is if fighting reduces.”  ’Sudden and serious’ The U. S. State Department said the security situation in Juba on Sunday had seen a ”sudden and serious deterioration,” with clashes between government and opposition forces breaking out into ”general fighting.”  Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said in a tweet that Indian nationals were being evacuated and warned others not to travel to the country. There are many Indian nationals working at the U. N mission there. Koro Bessho, Japan’s ambassador to the United Nations, confirmed the death of a Chinese soldier, while Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported the death of a second Chinese peacekeeper.   Other Chinese and Rwandan peacekeepers also sustained injuries. How many have been killed in fighting between the factions is unclear. One estimate puts the death toll close to 150, while other reports indicate more than 270 have been killed. CNN is working to confirm an exact death toll.  Gunfire from ”heavy weaponry” was exchanged for much of Sunday outside a U. N. building on the outskirts of Juba, the U. N. mission to the country said. The mission sent out a series of tweets at about 8:25 a. m. (1:25 a. m. ET) describing ”gunshots” and a ”heavily armed exchange” outside a U. N. compound.  The U. S. Embassy issued an alert saying that fighting between government and opposition forces was ongoing at the U. N. mission’s headquarters, the Jebel area of the city and near the airport.  The U. N. mission said that 1, 000 internally displaced people had fled its protection as violence hit areas near their camps.  ”Both UNMISS compounds in Juba have sustained impacts from small arms and heavy weapons fire. ”The United Nations urges all parties to respect the sanctity of the United Nations and condemns any deliberate targeting of United Nations premises and its personnel,” it said in a statement. Flights canceled, Kenya Airways, which operates two flights a day to Juba, said it was suspending all flights to the city because of an ”uncertain security situation,” while Britain’s Foreign Office advised against all travel to South Sudan, saying ”the security situation in Juba has deteriorated” since Friday. Rwanda Air and Fly 540 also said they were suspending flights into Juba.  The country is nearly out of money because its funds come almost exclusively from oil revenue    the value of which has plummeted. People have become desperate. In lieu of payment, government soldiers have reportedly been allowed to rape women, a U. N. report said. South Sudan gained independence in 2011 after 98% of the population voted to break away from Sudan. The East African nation, the youngest country in the world, quickly fell into civil war that took on ethnic undertones.  In December 2013, soldiers from Kiir’s Dinka ethnic group tried to disarm Nuer soldiers perceived to be loyal to Machar. Soldiers targeted Nuer civilians in the ensuing fighting, Human Rights Watch said. At least 50, 000 were killed and more than 2 million displaced in the civil war, and nearly 5 million people faced severe food shortages.  Under a peace deal signed in August, Kiir became the president of the country, and Machar the first vice president."
37362,56195,Turkey declares three-month state of emergency,CNN,,2016-07-20,2016.0,7.0,,"Istanbul (CNN) Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the nation is imposing a   state of emergency in the aftermath of last week’s bloody coup attempt.  Erdogan met Wednesday with his national security council and council of ministers, the latter of which approved the state of emergency recommendation.  ”The purpose of the declaration of the state of emergency is, in fact, to be able to take the most efficient steps in order to remove this threat as soon as possible, which is a threat to democracy, to the rule of law and to the rights and freedoms of the citizens in our country,” Erdogan said, according to a government translation. Erdogan, speaking to a national television audience, said the state of emergency was not a threat to democracy. Governors will have expanded powers and the army will be under the command and control of the governors, the President said.  He guaranteed that all the ”viruses” in the armed forces would be cleansed. ”It is very similar to a cancer,” he said. ”It is like a metastasis that is going on in the body that is Turkey. And we will clean it out.” The President praised the reactions to the coup attempt, in which 246 people died and 1, 536  were wounded.   ”Every member of our nation came together as one,” he said.

In total, more than 9, 400 people are being detained, the vast majority of them from the military. How safe are U. S. nukes in Turkey? Western leaders have urged  Erdogan and his government to respect democratic principles and act within the law in response to talk of reviving the death penalty and   punishments over the coup.  Who has been netted? The purge has gutted the leadership in the country’s security forces, with at least 118 generals and admirals detained, stripping the   command of the Turkish military by a third, according to Turkish state broadcaster TRT.  Authorities have also suspended 8, 777  Ministry of Interior personnel, mostly police, as well as 100 Turkish intelligence service personnel, according to the   Anadolu news agency. Here’s a tally of just some of the others who have been affected, according to Anadolu:   21, 738 teachers in private institutions have had their licenses revoked,   2, 745 judges and prosecutors have been listed for detention, although it is unclear if they have all been detained,   1, 577 university deans have been asked to resign. Anadolu reported that Turkey’s top broadcasting authority on Tuesday revoked the licenses for 24 radio and television companies that it said are linked to Fethullah Gulen, whom Erdogan blames for masterminding the coup. Turkey on Tuesday formally requested the extradition of Gulen from the United States, where he lives in   exile. MORE: Who is man blamed for coup? WikiLeaks shut down, The government has blocked WikiLeaks after the whistleblower website dumped almost 300, 000 emails from Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) on Tuesday evening. Access was restricted because of a ”violation of privacy and publication of illegally obtained data,” a Turkish official told CNN. The organization had reported late Monday night that it had come under a sustained cyberattack after announcing on social media its plan to leak hundreds of thousands of documents on ”Turkish power.”  On Wednesday, using the hashtag #TurkeyPurge, WikiLeaks confirmed Erdogan’s government had ordered the site be blocked and offered users advice on proxies and IPs to use to access the site. The most recent emails were sent on July 6 and the oldest dates back to 2010, WikiLeaks said. ’Crackdown of exceptional proportions’ Rights group Amnesty International said that authorities had canceled 34 journalists’ press cards and called on Turkish authorities to not ”arbitrarily restrict freedom of expression.” ”We are witnessing a crackdown of exceptional proportions in Turkey at the moment,” said Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International’s Turkey researcher. ”Turkey’s people are still reeling from the shocking events of the weekend and it is vital that press freedom and the unhindered circulation of information are protected, rather than stifled.” State broadcaster TRT lost 370 staff members who have been suspended, according to CNN Turk.  Hundreds more have been suspended from the Prime Minister’s office and government bodies dealing with religious affairs, family and social policy and development. The total fired or suspended is around 50, 000 people. More than 9, 000 people are currently in detention and are under investigation over the coup, according to Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus.  Turkey’s Council of Higher Education also demanded all universities suspend academic assignments abroad and that an investigation be launched into all staff linked to what it calls the ”Fethullah Gulen Terrorist Organization,” Anadolu reported. Will Gulen be extradited? U. S. President Barack Obama spoke with Erdogan on Tuesday about the coup and the status of Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania.  Obama ”strongly condemned” the coup attempt and ”expressed his support for Turkish democracy,” a White House news release said, without explaining whether Gulen would be extradited. Exclusive: Erdogan vows revenge  Under the U. S.  extradition agreement, Washington can only extradite a person if he or she has committed an ”extraditable act.” Treason    such as that implied by Erdogan’s demand for Gulen’s extradition    is not listed as such an act in the countries’ treaty. Does the U. S. have to extradite Gulen? The Muslim cleric has denied any involvement in the coup attempt. Gulen, in a statement released Tuesday, said Erdogan ”once again demonstrated he will go to any length necessary to solidify his power and persecute his critics.”  EXCLUSIVE: Erdogan won’t rule out death penalty, ”It is ridiculous, irresponsible and false to suggest I had anything to do with the horrific failed coup. I urge the U. S. government to reject any effort to abuse the extradition process to carry out political vendettas,” he said. The reclusive cleric leads a popular movement called Hizmet, which includes hundreds of secular   schools, free tutoring centers, hospitals and relief agencies credited with addressing Turkey’s social problems. Soldiers sent for president told target a ’terrorist’ Soldiers sent to apprehend Erdogan during the attempted coup were told they were to ”capture an important terrorist leader,” Anadolu reported.  The soldiers involved in the President’s apprehension were informed of the details of the coup as they were being airlifted to a hotel in a resort town where Erdogan and his family were vacationing during Friday’s deadly attempted takeover.  It is unclear how many soldiers participated in the attack, during which two of Erdogan’s bodyguards were killed, and it is unclear how loyal the troops were, given that they were briefed on the coup so late in proceedings.  Meanwhile, Erdogan’s military aide, Lt. Col. Erkan Kivrak, has been taken into custody in southern Turkey for alleged ties to the plotters, according to Anadolu.  Several senior figures in the military are facing court in Ankara, military officials have said."
37588,56426,Charges dropped in Chandra Levy murder,CNN,,2016-07-28,2016.0,7.0,," (CNN) A judge on Thursday dismissed murder charges against a man accused in the death of Chandra Levy, a Washington intern whose 2001 disappearance created national headlines. Federal prosecutors said they can no longer prove a case against Ingmar Guandique, Bill Miller, public information officer for the U. S. Attorney’s Office in Washington, said in a news release.  ”Today, in the interests of justice and based on recent unforeseen developments that were investigated over the past week, the office moved to dismiss the case charging Ingmar Guandique with the May 2001 murder of Chandra Levy,”  he said. Miller did not specify what the developments were.  The public defender’s office said the dismissal vindicates Guandique, who had always maintained his innocence, passed a lie detector test and was the victim of ”the most unreliable evidence: a jailhouse informant.” Levy, a    California native, was in Washington working as an intern for the Bureau of Prisons when she was last seen on May 1, 2001. Her skull was found more than a year later, on May 22, 2002, in Rock Creek Park. Levy’s disappearance gained national attention after her parents discovered a connection between her and Gary Condit, who was then a congressman for Levy’s California district.  Condit was never a suspect in the case, but he and Levy were romantically linked and Condit was questioned intensively about Levy’s whereabouts. Levy’s mother, Susan Levy, said she was ”totally in a state of shock.” ”I am sick to my stomach and am having trauma and grief all over again,” she said. Levy had no comment when asked what the government told her about dropping the charges, but said she hopes prosecutors will ”put the information out there.” ”We all want our truth,” she said. ”I want to make sure we find out the truth. My husband and I hope that justice is found for our family.” Condit issued a statement Thursday through his lawyer, saying he was disappointed in the dismissal. ”The failure of authorities to bring formal closure to this tragedy after 15 years is very disappointing but in no way alters the fact that Mr. Condit was long ago completely exonerated by authorities in connection with Ms. Levy’s death,” according to the statement. Guandique, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, was sentenced to 60 years in prison after being convicted in 2010 of killing and robbing Levy.  His lawyers appealed the conviction and questioned the credibility of prosecution witness Armando Morales, a convicted felon and former gang member who testified that Guandique confessed to him that he killed Levy. A judge granted a new trial in May 2015 and the hearing was scheduled for October. Miller said prosecutors will not pursue the retrial. Beyond Miller’s brief statement, prosecutors didn’t comment on the case. Public defender criticizes government case, Laura E. Hankins of the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia said, ”This dismissal vindicates Mr. Guandique.  Finally, the government has had to concede the flaws in its   conviction.” Morales, she said, was ”a perjurer who too easily manipulated the prosecutors.” ”Because the government hid the identity of the jailhouse informant from the defense until just before trial and failed to provide critical documents to the defense, it took years of   investigation and litigation by the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia to uncover the extent of the flaws in Mr. Guandique’s trial and to force the government to search and   its own records,” she said. In a motion to dismiss filed last December, defense lawyers said Morales told District of Columbia prosecutors he’d never cooperated with authorities before the Guandique case because he adhered to a ”don’t snitch” philosophy.  But Morales had cooperated with different prosecutors over the years in exchange for favorable accommodations in prison, the documents said. The motion also said prosecutors hid information from the defense, including the first page of Morales’ original   statement about Guandique’s supposed confession and other documents. Guandique is in ICE custody, Police arrested Guandique in February 2009. He was then serving a   sentence for attacking two other women in the park. Judge Robert Morin of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia signed an order dismissing the charges. Guandique was released to the custody of immigration officials on Saturday and now faces deportation proceedings.  ICE issued this statement: ”Based on today’s court action, Ingmar Guandique will enter the custody of U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and be issued a notice to appear in immigration court. Due to his previous criminal convictions, he is considered a threat to public safety, and ICE intends to maintain him in custody.”"
37594,56432,Clinton tries to wrestle change candidate mantle from Trump in Western Pennsylvania,CNN,Dan Merica,2016-07-30,2016.0,7.0,,"Johnstown, PA (CNN) Hillary Clinton, standing on a metal working factory floor here in Western Pennsylvania, tried to cut into Donald Trump’s grip on white, working class voters by casting herself    not the    nominee    as 2016’s change candidate. Clinton, surrounded by factory equipment and spooled iron, attacked Trump’s business record and argued that the more people listen to the Republican nominee talk, the more they realize ”he is not offering real change, he is offering empty promises.” ”I just want people as we go into this election to be fair. Because yes, we do have work to do, we can’t be satisfied with the status quo,” Clinton said. ”I am not. Not by a long shot.” Clinton, along with her new running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, is in the midst of a   bus tour through Pennsylvania and Ohio that is meant to make inroads with Republicans turned off by Trump and disaffected Democrats who could be wooed by Trump’s message of economic security and cracking down on immigration. The trip has also been a chance for Clinton to cut into Republican’s claim that he is the change candidate in the 2016 race. It is an easy case for him to make: Democrats have controlled the White House for eight years and Trump, a political novice, regularly talks about how he would bring a different set of skills to the White House. Republicans have even used the status quo argument against Clinton. Mike Pence, Trump’s vice presidential nominee, called Clinton the ”secretary of status quo” in his speech at the Republican National Convention earlier this month. But Clinton’s campaign is looking to convince voters that while, yes, Trump would bring change to the country, it is not change anyone wants. Clinton’s argument on Saturday was that Trump would tank the economy, ruin relationships abroad and hurt working Americans. ”Look, I know people are angry or frustrated,” Clinton said shortly after someone shouted at the small event. ”I think we just heard one. I understand that. I am not going into this with some rose colored classes. I know we have work to do.” In particular, Clinton has seized on Trump saying in his Republican National Convention speech that he ”alone can fix” the country. ”Most of all, we know better to believe anyone who says, I alone can fix it,” Clinton said. ”I think that should set off alarm bells for everybody. Because by saying that, he is forgetting what all the rest of us do everyday.” Clinton is uniquely tied to the administration of Barack Obama, though. She served as Obama’s secretary of state for four years and has run on his record throughout the 2016 race. She even used Obama as a way to hit Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary, faulting him for criticizing the president.  Clinton argued on Saturday that sometimes, because of the political back and forth, people ”lose track with where we are” economically.  ”We have come a long way since the worst financial crisis in a generation and it could have gotten a whole lot worse,” Clinton said, commending Obama’s handling of the economic crash and his decision to bailout the auto industry in 2009. Clinton’s bus trip, which continues on Saturday with events in Pittsburgh and Youngstown, Pennsylvania, is also meant to fortify her support in two key swing states. Trump’s campaign sees a narrow path to victory for the candidate who unexpectedly won the Republican primary, acknowledging at times that Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania and Ohio are critical to his success. Clinton’s tour, which was meant to mimic former President Bill Clinton’s   bus tour in 1992, ends in Columbus on Monday."
38486,57334,US doubts Russia’s claim it killed ISIS spokesman,CNN,,2016-08-31,2016.0,8.0,," (CNN) Russia said one of its airstrikes in Syria killed ISIS spokesman Mohammad      a claim that a US official called preposterous.  On Wednesday, Russia’s Ministry of Defense announced it killed the terror leader on the ministry’s official Facebook page. It said Adnani was one of up to 40 ISIS militants killed by a Russian bomber in Aleppo province.  But a US defense official slammed Russia’s assertion.  ”It would be laughable but for the very real humanitarian suffering Russia has inflicted,” the defense official said Wednesday. ”We stand by the statement we made yesterday.  We conducted a strike that targeted  .  We are assessing the results of that strike.” That attack was carried out by a US drone, two US defense officials told CNN on Wednesday. On Tuesday, ISIS announced Adnani’s death in a rare public statement. His death marks the   killing yet of an ISIS member.  A key deputy to ISIS leader Abu Bakr   he was floated to be his successor should anything happen to Baghdadi.  A statement from ISIS’ Amaq news agency on Tuesday said Adnani died while inspecting military operations in the area of Aleppo. ISIS has not revealed his cause of death and said it was ”determined to seek revenge” for the killing. ”After a journey filled with sacrifice and fight against   the Syrian Gallant knight, Abu Mohammed   joined the convoy of martyr leaders,” ISIS said.  ”To the filthy and coward nonbelievers and to the holders of the Christ emblem, we bring the good news, which will keep them awake, that a new generation in the Islamic State . .. that loves death more than life . .. this generation will only grow steadfast on the path to Jihad, stay determined to seek revenge and be violent toward them.” Death of senior leader   caps bad month for ISIS, ’Significant blow’ Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said Tuesday that while the results of the   coalition’s airstrike against Adnani were not clear, his ”removal from the battlefield would mark another significant blow to ISIS.”  ”  has served as principal architect of ISIS’ external operations and as ISIS’ chief spokesman. He has coordinated the movement of ISIS fighters, directly encouraged   attacks on civilians and members of the military and actively recruited new ISIS members. The U. S. military will continue to prioritize and relentlessly target ISIS leaders and external plotters in order to defend our homeland, our allies and our partners, while we continue to gather momentum in destroying ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria and combat its metastases around the world.” More than a spokesman, As spokesman, Adnani was the group’s most prominent face, the first to announce the ISIS caliphate even before Baghdadi did.  But he was much more than a spokesman, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said.  Adnani was   for ordering operatives to attack countries participating in the coalition against ISIS. Western intelligence believes he had command responsibility for the November 2015 Paris attacks.  He is believed to have carried out those orders as one of the ISIS leaders overseeing its security service, known as Amniyat, which includes the external operations unit tasked with international attacks on the West. As such, the external operations unit reported up to Adnani. A number of ISIS followers and members captured and questioned in the last two years, including French jihadists Faiz Bouchrane and Reda Hame, have attested to Adnani as head of the Amniyat.   of Abu Bakr  : I want a new life in Europe, ”In some ways he’s a more dangerous figure than Abu Bakr   because he’s believed to be overseeing the external operations division of ISIS, and that’s the part of ISIS which threatens the West, which carried out the attacks in Paris, which could one day carry out an attack in the US on a significant scale,” Cruickshank said. First to declare ISIS caliphate, Adnani has been with ISIS since its beginnings and was close to Baghdadi, CNN’s Nic Robertson said. In June 2014, he was the first to declare a caliphate for parts of Syria and Iraq, indicating ISIS’ aim to become a governing entity and not just a terrorist group. Born in Syria in 1977, Adnani was the most senior Syrian in ISIS, a trait that some analysts say may have counted against him in a leadership bid among the   terror group. The US State Department officially labeled Adnani a terrorist in August 2014 and put a $5 million bounty on his head. It described him as ”the official spokesman for and a senior leader” of ISIS, a position he obtained after becoming one of the first foreign fighters to oppose   forces in Iraq. He was arrested in May 2005 in Anbar province and is believed to have spent some time between 2005 and 2010 at the US detention facility Camp Bucca. Who might lead ISIS if   dies? After his arrival in Syria, he was appointed deputy of Abu Mohammed   leader of the Islamic State of Iraq for the northern province, then as the security leader before assuming a key role in external operations for ISIS, according to the UN Security Council.  ’Crush their heads with rocks’ ”He was the mouthpiece of ISIS. He said things like, ’If you can’t shoot them, then stab them, and if you can’t stab them, then crush their heads with rocks. If you can’t do that, then drive your cars, your vehicles, to kill them,” Robertson said. ”He absolutely tried to maximize every opportunity to instill fear in Syria and Iraq and the international community and send fighters overseas to attack.” Adnani said ISIS supporters in the West had a religious duty to launch   attacks, a move analysts call a game changer that may have inspired attacks in North America, Europe and Australia. ”He was the strategic leader of the organization, especially when it comes to attacks on the West,” said journalist Graeme Wood, Edward R. Murrow Press Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”To have that voice destroyed is a serious blow to the organization, probably the most significant kill that the enemies of the Islamic State have perpetrated since its declaration of the caliphate.”"
38766,57615,"9/11 cuts deep in Trump, Clinton campaigns",CNN,Eric Bradner,2016-09-10,2016.0,9.0,,"Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will set aside the presidential campaign for one day as the two candidates pause for the 15th anniversary of the largest terror attack ever in the United States    and in the state they both call home.  Clinton will begin Sunday morning at Ground Zero in Manhattan, participating in an annual moment of silence at 8:46 a. m. ET to mark the moment the first plane hit a World Trade Center tower.  She won’t speak and is going to pay her respects    not in a campaign capacity    her aides said. Trump is expected to visit the Ground Zero memorial and a nearby firehouse, a New York City official told CNN Saturday. A campaign source told CNN he would make a stop after his visit to Ground Zero but did not provide details. Despite the   reprieve, both Clinton and Trump have made   major themes of their campaigns, each speaking vividly about the aftermath of the attacks and the United States’ actions since.   In January, when GOP primary rival Sen. Ted Cruz attacked ”New York values,” Trump recalled   vividly in a debate.  ”It was with us for months, the smell,” Trump said. ”And everybody in the world loved New York, loved New Yorkers    and I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement.” RELATED: Looking back at   Americans feel fear, anger, worry, Clinton was at Ground Zero on the day after the attacks and worked in the Senate to bring billions of dollars in aid for first responders and rebuilding efforts to New York City    a role she has touted on the campaign trail.  ”I was a senator from New York,” Clinton said Tuesday in Tampa. ”I knew people who were killed. I worked with families and the few survivors. I worked to get the health care needed by our first responders and emergency workers who ran toward danger. I worked to make our country safer and to rebuild New York and the Pentagon.” They also have used the aftermath of the   attacks to push their case for why they should be the next commander in chief. Trump claimed Thursday at a charter school in Cleveland that he would have caught Osama bin Laden prior to the   attacks he masterminded.  ”I would have been tougher on terrorism,” Trump said. ”Bin Laden would’ve been caught a long time ago, before he was ultimately caught, prior to the downing of the World Trade Center.”  Clinton, meanwhile, often recalls being in the White House Situation Room with President Barack Obama the day he   the mission that led to the killing of bin Laden, saying the moment underscores her experience with tough security decisions and shows why she’s ready to be in the Oval Office. ”When it came time to go around the table, with extremely experienced, thoughtful experts, we all gave our opinions. I was one who said I thought it was worth the risk,” Clinton said Thursday in Tampa.  It’s long been a prominent portion of Clinton’s stump speech. She told an Iowa crowd in January it was ”one of the most tense days of my life.”  And they also use the policies that   spawned to take the each other down. At an event Thursday, Clinton described Navy SEALs removing women and children from bin Laden’s compound. ”That, Donald Trump, is what American honor looks like,” she said.  Trump, meanwhile, has made his opposition to the Iraq War, launched under President George W. Bush in the wake of the   attacks, a core foreign policy talking point.  Trump has repeatedly claimed he opposed the Iraq war from the beginning, even though he supported it in a 2002 interview with Howard Stern and didn’t make any public comments opposing the war before it began. He’s cited Clinton’s vote in favor of it as evidence of her poor   ability.  ”Had I been in Congress at the time of the invasion, I would have cast a vote in opposition,” he said Thursday in Cleveland. But both candidates plan to pause those efforts to persuade voters on the 15th anniversary of the   attacks.  The tradition of presidential candidates shutting their campaigns down for the anniversary of the   attacks began in 2004, with President George W. Bush and Democratic challenger John Kerry.  In 2008,  . Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain held a joint event at Ground Zero. And in 2012, Obama and Mitt Romney suspended their negative advertisements and held separate events focused on   and military service.  This election, the day has even more resonance for the candidates, since both parties’ nominees are New Yorkers.  At the same time, their personal ties to the sensitive historical event haven’t kept Trump and Clinton free from controversy on the subject. RELATED: 5 years ago the U. S. killed Osama bin Laden. Did it matter? In a November debate against Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders, Clinton invoked the   attacks and her tenure as a New York senator, from 2001 to 2009, to fend off charges from the Vermont senator that she was too close to Wall Street.  The comment    connecting   with campaign finance    infuriated liberals, with Sanders saying the next day that he had ”no idea what the connection is” and another candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, calling it ”a pretty disgraceful moment.”  One week later, Trump set off a bigger controversy with a claim he made at a rally in Birmingham, Alabama.  ”I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down,” he said. ”And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering.”  Local police said Trump’s claim was wrong,   disputed it and Trump’s campaign never produced any evidence to support it.  Still, Trump stood by it the next day in an interview with ABC ”This Week” host George Stephanopoulos, saying, ”It was on television. I saw it.”  ”There were people that were cheering on the other side of New Jersey, where you have large Arab populations. They were cheering as the World Trade Center came down,” Trump said.  Trump was pilloried by his rivals for the comment. Former New York Gov. George Pataki, at that time a primary rival, tweeted that he wasn’t sure ”what luxury  ” Trump hid in on   ”but I saw Americans come together that day.” "
39462,58316,Hong Kong protest leader barred from Thailand,CNN,Julia Jones,2016-10-04,2016.0,10.0,,"Hong Kong (CNN) Joshua Wong, a student leader who helped bring tens of thousands of people onto Hong Kong’s streets during   protests in 2014, was deported to Hong Kong after being detained at Bangkok airport.  ”I was illegally confined and blocked from contacting the outside world by Thai Customs and Police,” Wong posted on Facebook. Wong says his passport confiscated soon after arriving in Bangkok on a flight from Hong Kong. Wong was due to take part in a panel discussion organized by student activists to mark the 40th anniversary of Thailand’s Thammasart University Massacre.  ”After they confiscated my passport, [they] immediately detained me at the airport detention center alone. I’m fortunate to have returned to Hong Kong,” Wong said. ”It was a scary 10 plus hours. Sorry for all those who worried about me.” The activist’s detention at the border was due to a letter from China, according to Thailand’s most prominent group of student activists, New Democracy Movement. Chinese authorities, however, told CNN that China respects Thai immigration policy, and did not respond to inquiries regarding the existence of a letter asking Wong be denied entry to Thailand.  Thai government spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd said in statement released Wednesday that there had been ”no instruction or order given, pertaining Mr. Wong.”  Marking university massacre, Wong had been due to meet Thai student activist, Netiwit Chotipatpaisal, at Suvarnabhumi airport early Wednesday morning but failed to appear.  Chotipatpaisal told Demosistō    Wong’s   political party     that the student had been detained, according to a statement on the party’s Facebook page. Chotipatpaisal says Thai airport authorities told him they had received a letter from the Chinese government, but didn’t reveal its contents. Chotipatpaisal said his request to see Wong was declined. The university gathering was already sensitive, marking a day in 1976 that saw dozens of students killed in the hands of state forces.  Thailand is currently under military rule and the regime is widely criticized by human rights groups for being oppressive and undemocratic. ”The detention and deportation of Joshua Wong are yet another indicator that Thailand’s military government will use any available means to stifle political discourse in the country,” Champa Patel, Amnesty International’s senior research adviser for South East Asia and the Pacific, said in a statement on Wednesday. Mysterious disappearances  Earlier Wednesday, Nathan Law, president of Wong’s political party Demosistō, told CNN that he was ”seriously concerned” about Wong’s welfare, especially in light of the recent case of Gui Minhai, a Hong   bookseller who published gossipy books about China’s elite.  Gui mysteriously disappeared from Pattaya in Thailand in 2015 and appeared three months later on   television in China, making an apparent confession to a fatal hit and run.  Gui was one of five booksellers who disappeared in late 2015, fueling suggestions that Beijing was cracking down on dissidents beyond Chinese borders. His daughter maintains her father was abducted. ’ ’ In April, Wong announced he was forming a new political party that would ”demand  ” for Hong Kong.  ”If we do not fight for   the Chinese Communist Party will determine our future,” he told CNN at the time. In August, a magistrates’ court in Hong Kong sentenced Wong to 80 hours of community service after he was convicted of taking part in a rally in front of the Central Government Offices in September 2014.  The rally sparked the   long Occupy Central demonstrations, also known as the Umbrella Movement, which shut down down key roads in the city."
40396,59263,"After Fidel Castro’s death, can Cuba finally move on?",CNN,Nic Robertson,2016-11-26,2016.0,11.0,," (CNN) Fidel Castro’s death is the end of an era. He has gone not with a bang, as he arrived, nor with a whimper, but a simple fading away. Laid low by serious illness, his iron grip on the island nation had loosened over the past decade, with full power passing to his brother Raul in 2008. Castro’s communist impulses were imprisoned by his increasing infirmity. In his failing years, he witnessed much of what he stood for slip away. Diplomatic relations with the US    that 50 years ago had the world on the brink of nuclear war    are on the mend. Whether he backed his brother in this detente is unclear what is clear is that a quarter of a century after the collapse of their principal sponsor    the Soviet Union    neither of the brothers could stand in the way of their people’s wishes any longer. Over the decades, plans were hatched to remove Castro by force if needed    the CIA reputedly plotted to put explosives in one of the Cuban leader’s favorite cigars. Despite the machinations, he survived to be a thorn in the side of every US administration. Obama’s legacy, A throwback to a bygone era of Communism that most of the world had forgotten, Cuba was less than 100 miles from the home of capitalism, America. This situation could not last. When President Obama came to office in 2009, Fidel had already seen off 10 of his predecessors, but it was Obama who was to help turn the course of Cuban history. He pledged to improve relations between the two countries. In April 2015, a handshake with Raul Castro in Panama signalled that one of Obama’s foreign policy goals might be on track. A month later, Cuba was removed from the US list of ”State Sponsors of Terror” and within a year, President Obama travelled to Cuba    the first visit by a US President while in office in 88 years. Already relations between the two countries had been improving with the US allowing closer cooperation in telecommunications as the door to trade begun to creak open.  Following the 1961 abortive CIA inspired ”Bay of Pigs” coup attempt to topple Castro and the ensuing Cuban missile crisis    when Castro invited the Soviet Union to base nuclear missiles on Cuba    successive US administrations had used a twin strategy of diplomatic and economic isolation. Replacing Raul Castro, Direct flights from the US to Cuba resumed in September this year, opening the doors to a potential influx of US Tourism dollars. Deeper trade ties may take a little longer: the US 1996 Helms Burton Act states that full economic links can not be restored until Cuba holds ”free and fair” elections. Raul Castro has said that he will step down in 2018. How his replacement is selected will no doubt be a matter of close scrutiny, not just by the US Congress, but by the hundreds of thousands of Cuban diaspora. How that transition unfolds will be a reflection of Raul Castro’s own rapprochement with the US. However, it currently feels less that he is opening the country up than the country and its people are beginning to burst free."
40765,59635,"Mass shooter Dylann Roof, with a laugh, confesses, ’I did it’",CNN,,2016-12-09,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) Dylann Roof wasted no time confessing to the massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, according to an FBI video shown Friday at his murder trial in Charleston, South Carolina. ”I went to that church in Charleston and I did it,” he said, then laughed.  ”Did you shoot them?” a law enforcement officer asked a calm and composed Roof.  ”Yes,” Roof replied, followed by another laugh.  Asked how many people he killed that day, the young man in the   haircut replied calmly: ”If I was going to guess, five maybe. I’m really not sure.”  In the video, the   white supremacist said he opened fire with a Glock .  pistol.  He fired 70 rounds that night in June 2015. A dozen people had stood for prayers, their eyes closed, prosecutors said. Nine were killed. ”I didn’t say anything to them,” Roof said of his victims.  What about after the shootings?  ”I didn’t talk to them.” Roof admitted in the video that he ”drank a little” just before visiting the church. He sat with his victims for about 15 minutes before the slaughter. They handed him a sheet with religious verses.   ”It was a Bible study,” he said.  He brought with him seven magazines, he told investigators. A bag and his weapon.    ”I was sitting there thinking if I should do it or not,” Roof said, according to the video.  ”I could have walked out. I don’t want to say it was spur of the moment.”  In the video, Roof is seen sitting at a circular table at the Shelby, North Carolina, police department, after his arrest. He occasionally gestures with his hands but his voice    deep and monotone    betrays no emotion. The sun hits the camera lens, partly washing out the young man’s face. ”Somebody had to do it,” Roof said of the slayings. He added that ”black people are killing white people everyday. .. What I did is so minuscule compared to what they do to white people every day.” He researched the city and the church and then acted alone.  ’Our people are superior,’ Roof told investigators, ”I like Charleston,” he said in the video, which is more than two hours long.  ”It’s historic, too, you know. I think at one time it had the highest ratio of blacks to white during slavery, and AME is a historic church. I researched black churches.” The web also influenced his deadly handiwork. ”It sounds lame but it was pretty much the Internet,” he said.  After sketching out the massacre scene for investigators, Roof said, he emptied seven magazines. His victims cowered under tables, he recalled. No one tried to escape.  ”It was pop, pop, pop,” he said, adding that he was didn’t shoot a woman who was looking at him. Roof said he was ”in absolute awe” that police weren’t waiting outside when he left the building. He had been prepared to kill himself in the event of a confrontation with police.  At one point, Roof, 22, described his crime as ”political” and said he considered himself ”a white supremacist.”  ”Our people are superior,” he said. ”That’s just the fact.” His views on race were awakened by the Trayvon Martin case in Florida, he said. He also talked about Muslims overrunning parts of Europe. He said he supported Hitler.   His goal was ”to agitate race relations,” the suspect said.  Asked by an investigator if his crime made him feel ”glad,” Roof said: ”I had to do it. I wouldn’t say I was glad.”  When told he had killed eight people at the scene and a ninth died at a hospital, Roof said, ”Well, it makes me feel bad.”  He said he couldn’t look at relatives of his victims if they were seated across from him.  Did he have a message for the public? ”Ugh, I don’t know.”    Before his confession, Roof munched on Burger King hamburger brought to him by police officers.   The showing of the video Friday capped a dramatic and emotional week for the 12 jurors and six alternates, as well as attendees at the trial in federal court. Roof’s mother passed out and collapsed during a lunch recess in the courtroom Wednesday. His attorney said in a court filing that she suffered a heart attack.  Roof was ”cold and calculating” in planning an attack, a federal prosecutor said in opening statements. Roof studied the church’s history in the black community, found out what time a Bible study class would be held, loaded his gun the night before, packed extra ammunition and drove more than an hour to the church, Assistant US Attorney Jay Richardson told the jury of nine whites and three  . He was welcomed into the Bible study and displayed a ”cold and hateful heart” by sitting with the group more than 30 minutes, Richardson said. Tywanza Sanders, one of those killed, told Roof that he didn’t have to shoot them, saying, ”We mean you no harm,” the prosecutor said, recounting the story of one of the survivors.  Roof, who is white, replied, ”Y’all are raping our white women, y’all are taking over the world,” Richardson said. After he was captured, authorities learned Roof had written a ”manifesto” of his racist beliefs and posed for photos with the US flag burning in one hand and the Confederate flag in the other, Richardson said.  Roof also designed his own logo that included his initials, a swastika and the number 88, which for white supremacists stands for ”Heil Hitler,” the prosecutor said. ”He created the symbol to reflect who he was, what he thought and what he had done,” Richardson said. Defense statement, Opening for the defense, attorney David Bruck told the jury, ”You’re probably wondering why there has to be a trial.” The practical reason for the trial, Bruck said, is that the government has asked for the death penalty. Bruck said the jury will decide guilt or innocence in the first phase of the trial. In the second phase, the jury will decide on punishment. Bruck reminded the jury of Roof’s youth and urged them to try to understand him. Roof told the FBI he didn’t have any friends, Bruck said. Jurors should ask where Roof’s feelings of racial hatred came from, Bruck said. ”How much sense does this crime make, does it make any sense and if any at all, what does that tell you?” he asked. Bruck said he would not call any witnesses. Roof sat mostly motionless in his      striped jumpsuit throughout opening statements, barely looking up from the defense table. Tywanza Sanders was at Bible study with mom, aunt, Felicia Sanders, who survived the shooting, was one of seven prosecution witnesses on Wednesday. Sanders’    son, Tywanza, and   old aunt, Susie Jackson, were victims. Sanders teared up recalling her close friends and members of the church, including the Rev. Daniel Simmons, 74, a church staff member and former pastor of Friendship AME Church in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. Simmons, who was killed, ”was the backbone of the church,” Sanders said.  Richardson showed pictures of all nine victims as Sanders spoke. They smiled and looked happy.  She screamed, ’He has a gun’ At Bible study, Sanders recalled the church’s   the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was killed, gave Roof a copy of the page they were studying. Sanders said Roof hung his head down during their group    ”just as he’s doing right now.”  Roof also appeared to have his eyes closed throughout Sanders’ testimony. Sanders shut her own eyes as she recalled that night.  Then, ”a lot of sound went off,” she said. She screamed, ”He has a gun.” Roof had already shot Pinckney. Sanders was under a table.  ”There were so many shots,” she said. Her granddaughter said, ”Granny, I’m so scared.” ”Play dead, play dead,” Sanders recalled telling her.   ”I muzzled her face to my body so tight that I thought I suffocated her,” Sanders said.  Sanders said Roof asked Polly Sheppard, a retired nurse, if he had shot her yet. Sheppard replied, ”No.”  Sanders said Roof wanted her to tell his story.  Roof faces 33 federal charges: nine counts of violating the Hate Crime Act resulting in death three counts of violating the Hate Crime Act involving an attempt to kill nine counts of obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death three counts of obstruction of exercise of religion involving an attempt to kill and use of a dangerous weapon and nine counts of use of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence. If convicted, he could face the death penalty."
40984,59855,US says China will return underwater drone,CNN,Karl de Vries,2016-12-17,2016.0,12.0,,"Washington (CNN) China has agreed to return the US underwater drone that it seized in international waters earlier this week, the Pentagon said Saturday. ”We have registered our objection to China’s unlawful seizure of a US unmanned underwater vehicle operating in international waters in the South China Sea. Through direct engagement with Chinese authorities, we have secured an understanding that the Chinese will return the UUV to the United States,” Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said in a statement. Details were not immediately available on when or how the drone may be returned. Earlier, China’s Defense Ministry said authorities had decided to return it, but criticized the US for having ”hyped up” the issue.   Donald Trump weighed in on the incident, calling China’s action ”unprecedented.”  Later in the day, he tweeted, ”We should tell China that we don’t want the drone they stole back.  let them keep it!” ”Upon confirming that the device was a US underwater drone, the Chinese side decided to transfer it to the US side in an appropriate manner,” Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Sr. Col. Yang Yujun said. ”China and the United States have been communicating about this process. It is inappropriate    and unhelpful for a resolution    that the US has unilaterally hyped up the issue. We express our regret over that.” The statement added that the US ”has been frequently deploying ships and aircraft to conduct   surveillance and military surveys in waters facing China. China firmly opposes such acts and demands the US cease such activities. China will stay alert over relevant US activities and will take necessary measures to counter them.” A message left with the State Department was not returned. RELATED: Pentagon demands China return US underwater drone, Saturday morning, Trump tweeted, ”China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters   rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act.” Trump initially tweeted that it was an ”unpresidented” act, leading him to delete the message and retweet it with the correct spelling. Incident in international waters, The incident, the latest encounter in international waters in the South China Sea region, occurred earlier this week about 100 miles off the Philippine port at Subic Bay. The USNS Bowditch had stopped in the water to pick up two underwater drones. At that point, a Chinese naval ship that had been shadowing the Bowditch put a small boat into the water. That small boat came up alongside and the Chinese crew took one of the drones. The US got no answer from the Chinese on the radio when it said the drone was American property, a US defense official told CNN. As they turned away, the Chinese did come up on the radio and indicated they were returning to their own operations. US oceanographic research vessels are often followed in the water under the assumption they are spying. In this case, however, the drone was simply measuring ocean conditions, the official said. Cook earlier in the week said said China had ”unlawfully seized” the drone, calling for its immediate return. Although it’s unclear what the motivation was for the Chinese, the seizing of the drone comes on the heels of other provocative incidents that have happened since Trump received a congratulatory call from Taiwan’s President, a violation of the US’s agreement with China’s ”One China policy.” China publicly voiced its disapproval of that incident and contacted the White House at the time."
41127,59999,Gas station clerk is lit on fire and left to die -- but why? ,CNN,Amanda Watts,2016-12-23,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) It’s been two days since the shocking crime and yet police have little to go on. Why would someone walk into a gas station, set the   attendant on fire and leave him to die? Authorities have no motive, no suspects    and a $10, 000 reward in the case hasn’t helped.  The shocking crime, captured in a   surveillance video, took place Wednesday evening at a Shell station near the logging community of Burney in northern California.  The video shows a masked man, in yellow rain gear with a black hoodie and gloves, walk into the store. He sprays the victim,    David Wicks, and floor with a flammable liquid, lights him on fire and walks out from behind the store counter.  The attacker left on bicycle. One matching the description was found a few blocks away. Paramedics arrived to find Wicks badly burned. He could only nod yes or no to their questions, Lt. Troy Clegg of the Shasta County Sheriff’s Office said at a news conference Thursday.  Medics asked Wicks whether he was intentionally targeted and he nodded yes, Clegg said. But Wicks couldn’t offer any more information.  He was airlifted to a hospital, where he died.  ”It’s horrible. I really can’t think of anybody that would ever do this to him,” customer Michael Lyons told CNN affiliate   in Chico. Secret Witness, which allows residents to call in tips anonymously, has offered a $10, 000 reward for information."
41145,60017,Boko Haram camp falls to Nigerian troops,CNN,,2016-12-24,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) The Nigerian army has captured Boko Haram’s ”last enclave” in Sambisa Forest, President Muhammadu Buhari said Saturday as he warned the militant fighters they ”no longer have a place to hide.” Buhari took to Facebook to say that the Islamic militant group’s Camp Zero fell to Nigerian troops early Friday afternoon in the northeastern state of Borno. Buhari said the camp’s capture was ”  and most gratifying news of the final crushing of Boko Haram terrorists.” After congratulating the army, he said that ”the terrorists are on the run” and called for them to be brought to justice. Nigerian army officers told CNN that military operations against Boko Haram would continue within Sambisa Forest and surrounding areas, where the Chibok schoolgirls who were abducted two years ago are believed to be held.  ISIS leader purportedly accepts Boko Haram’s pledge of allegiance, In April 2014, Boko Haram militants kidnapped an estimated 276 girls from a boarding school in Chibok in Borno. As many as 57 girls escaped almost immediately that year, and one was found as recently as May. In October, militants handed over 21 of the schoolgirls to authorities    the first mass release of any of the abducted girls and women. Just under 200 remain unaccounted for after that release. Boko Haram, which opposes Western education, wants to set up an Islamic caliphate in Nigeria. A UN report released this month indicates 8. 5 million people in northeastern Nigeria are in dire need of humanitarian aid after years of violence by Boko Haram."
41163,60035,2017: Year of hope or year of fear?,CNN,Julian Zelizer,2016-12-26,2016.0,12.0,," (CNN) It’s a safe bet that 2017 will be a year for the history books.  In the world of politics, we have not seen anything like this in recent memory, or maybe ever. Donald Trump rocked the U. S. with an election victory that almost nobody saw coming. His campaign, his persona, his style, and his rhetoric were unlike anything else that we have seen from a mainstream political candidate, let alone a victor. After such a turbulent year, it’s not easy to say where America is headed. But here are a number of major political issues that could well dominate 2017: Can we make progress on increasing middle class security?  If there was one big issue that came out front and center in this election, it is the fact that middle class Americans are struggling.  Even though the economic indicators are good, many Americans families don’t feel that their future is secure. They look at the growing economic divide between the rich and the poor, fearing that they and their children will fall down the bottom rung of the latter.  They are doing much better in terms of employment and income than they were a few years ago, but the kinds of jobs they enjoy seem less stable than in the heyday of unions, with fewer benefits and worse prospects for upward mobility. With rising education and health care costs, they worry about how their kids will do. This issue animated the supporters of Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. The economic anxiety drove millions of voters to choose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, believing that a fundamental change to the status quo is now essential if their communities are ever going to be rebuilt.  Whatever divisions exist between the parties, there is in fact common ground on this basic problem. The question will be whether the Trump administration decides to act on these concerns, and to do so in a way that could allow Democrats to give him their support.  While there are certain issues where Trump will clearly stick to the Republican playbook, such as supply side tax cuts, there are other areas such as infrastructure where there is the possibility for a deal. The key will be that the infrastructure package can’t be a series of tax cuts for private projects, as Trump has thus far suggested, but rather needs to be the kind of stimulus spending that will provide workers with good jobs.  How can we strengthen our counterterrorism policies? It is now time to thoroughly revamp our counterterrorism policy.  In the wake of ISIS, the United States and the world has increasingly been facing the troubling threat of a dispersed terrorist network that depends on lone wolves who commit horrendous acts in their name.  The kinds of attacks that we are now seeing might be considered attacks on ”soft targets,” such as holiday markets and nightclubs, that usually are not the focus of concerted security operations.  Furthermore, the terrorism is often committed by deranged individuals who have proclaimed their unity with ISIS even if they have little if any direct connection.   As a nation and as an international community we have failed to put into place an effective strategy to combat these threats. We need to rethink our security measures and develop a better way to flag individuals who might be problematic. We also need to direct our security operations toward soft targets and not simply major tourist sites.  Until we do so, we will be living on the perpetual edge.  Are our democratic institutions sound?  The question of whether our democratic institutions can withstand a Trump presidency have been raised by many of his loudest critics. Independent candidate Evan McMullin has been at the front of the pack, writing a number of important pieces warning that he sees autocratic and totalitarian tendencies in the new president that can threaten the freedom of the press, other civil liberties, and more.  Trump’s expansive understanding of executive power will put the other branches of government on alert, and in a defensive position. Conservatives who have been blasting Democrats about too much government interference in the economy have winced as the president has lashed out against specific businesses and started to warn that if they move their plants overseas he will take punitive action against individual companies.  His refusal so far to take sweeping steps to eliminate the potential conflicts of interest that exist with his business empire has raised alarms about whether this president will make big decisions about domestic and foreign policy with his eye on his family’s bottom line rather than what is in the best interest of the nation. Although complaints about excessive executive power and the abuse of authority are a perennial in politics, the genuine concerns about the health of our democratic institutions today are more intense than at any time in recent memory.   What happens to American journalism? US journalism can legitimately be viewed as in a state of crisis. This past year exposed a number of structural, professional and technological challenges that are shaking the core of this industry. The commercial pressures facing most major news organizations on television and in print has often led to the pursuit of stories that might not be worthy of so much attention but which do guarantee lots of eyeballs.  We have an incoming administration that will clearly challenge the press in a way we have not seen since President Richard Nixon and his Vice President Spiro Agnew went after the ”nattering nabobs of negativism” by withholding information from reporters and avoiding as much direct contact as possible. Social media affords Trump an opportunity to reach his followers while bypassing mainstream media. Trump doesn’t hesitate to directly attack journalists, as he has done via Twitter, in a toxic social media environment that stimulates fierce attacks from his followers.   The phenomenon of fake news and the willingness of political actors to say things that are patently untrue will force reporters to figure out how to handle this kind of information while adhering to   professional standards. All of the challenges have been brewing for some time now they are not an invention of 2016. But this election brought them all to the forefront of national debate and, for some, revealed the dangerous consequences this era of journalism can produce.   What happens to the genies that have been let out of the bottle?  Although many Republicans are acting as if they can move swiftly past the underside of the recent Republican campaign, they can’t. Ignoring the vitriol from the past year grossly minimizes the very dark forces that emerged throughout Donald Trump’s campaign.  Through his polemical and controversial statements, Trump mobilized some of the most reactionary elements of the electorate. His own words about illegal immigrants being ”rapists and murderers,” his sexist invectives, his broadsides against the entire religion of Islam and his hesitance to disassociate himself from people like David Duke energized fringe groups of Americans who have been angry about the pluralistic direction of America society since the 1960s. Just because the campaign is over and Trump is switching to ”governance” mode doesn’t mean that all the voters and organizations energized by his campaign will go away. They liked Trump because they believed he was their candidate, and they are expecting him to deliver.  You can’t play around with those political passions for political purposes and then assume they are forgotten. Whether Democrats and Republicans can push back on these forces will be an essential part of the upcoming year. As fearmongers have discovered in the past, it is often impossible to reverse the damage that these campaigns have wrought. The uptick in hate crimes that has followed the election could be just a taste of things to come.   What will the Democrats do?  This will be an urgent matter for the losing party. The Democrats were really slammed in this election. With united government, Republicans can now make immense changes if they stay on the same page.  It’s not clear that Democrats know what they should do. Some of them feel they need to cooperate with the administration, looking to possible areas of agreement.  Others are dead set against any proposals to work with Trump given what he represents and the radical threat that he, his Cabinet, and the Republican Congress pose to the social safety net. They have seen how Republicans have done well politically by being obstructionist throughout Obama’s presidency. And now they feel that there is no reason that they can’t do the same. The battle over who should direct the Democratic National Committee has turned into a debate about who has the best vision for rebuilding the electoral and organizational muscle of Democrats after they have suffered so many blows since 2010 with more and more of the political map looking red. Democrats will have to start making some big decisions about how to respond in the first few months of the New Year. The earliest battle might be when Trump puts an infrastructure bill forward. They will also have to decide how to respond if President Trump uses executive power to start to undo the progress that President Obama made on core issues like climate change, perhaps by walking away from the Paris Agreement, or on criminal justice reform relating to sentencing. Will we go to war?  The possibility of expanded military conflict may have increased with the outcome of the election.   Trump is someone who does not mind being provocative and has made some extremely hawkish statements about how he plans to take on threats like ISIS, although at times he has sounded an isolationist theme and spoken out against  .   Within a few days of winning office, he took a call from the leader of Taiwan, a clear blow to the ”one China” policy that the US has followed since the 1970s, and Trump continued the theme with blistering tweets about the last remaining communist superpower.  He is supportive of a Russian government that can easily create explosive situations around the globe. There are also many people who have his ear, such as National Security Adviser Mike Flynn and possible Deputy Secretary of State John Bolton, who may be willing to use military force as a first resort. Will the abundance of generals in the Cabinet lead to a preference for using military force over diplomacy?   We are already living in heated times. The civil war in Syria has led to a humanitarian disaster that is not likely to end anytime soon. An emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin will throw more support behind the brutal regime of Syrian President Bashar  . These existing conflicts, with a US president who has even bolder visions about who he would be willing to take on, leaves the world sitting with bated breath to see what comes next. The most important concrete issue that will be on the table is the Iran nuclear deal. Although this deal was extremely controversial when put into place, it has now become operationalized. Even critics like Gen.  James Mattis, the nominee for Secretary of Defense, don’t think it is possible to reverse. But if Trump uses his executive power to undo the deal, this would be the first clear sign that we are moving closer to a dangerous war with Iran. America enters 2017 divided, with one side fearing the consequences of a Trump presidency and the other with grand expectations that we are about to embark on a period of positive change. We will soon find out who’s right."

41412,60340,’World’s ugliest dog’ isn’t so ugly,CNN,,2015-01-09,2015.0,1.0,," (CNN) At first glance, Mugly    a    Chinese crested dog    is a rather unappealing and   animal.   With a few random hairs protruding from his snout, a pair of squinty, beady eyes and thin, patchy skin, his genetics didn’t do much for his exterior.  But beauty isn’t skin deep. And that is exactly what photographer Bego Anton wants to portray through her pictures of Mugly. ”Ugly Mugly is a reflection on how we relate to our pets and how what is close and important to us can change our perceptions on terms such as beauty,” Anton said.  Bev Nicholson is the owner of Mugly and five other dogs. None of the five is as   as Mugly, yet he is her prized possession in more ways than one    if his tiny outfits weren’t already telling of her immense love. Along with winning the ”World’s Ugliest Dog” contest in 2012 and being declared ”Great Britain’s Ugliest Dog” by a national newspaper in 2005, Mugly works as a therapy dog in a local hospital and attends a ton of charity events.  He helps raise money for small dog rescues in the United Kingdom    like the one where Nicholson found him. He visits schools and takes part in the ”Read to Dogs” program, where reluctant students can read to him without the fear of judgment and receive encouragement through his affection. Mugly has also appeared on television too many times to count, and he’s even been to Parliament to switch on the Christmas lights. ”Mugly’s life is far from being an ordinary dog’s life,” Anton said. ”He is more like a movie star.” When Anton first decided to profile the dog, she thought he was ugly, too, she admits. But after spending a week with him, she said, ”I discovered a sweet and lovable dog.” She even called him the  : beautiful. Nicholson knew right away this dog was special. Anton could tell there was a wonderful chemistry between them. ”I’ve never seen such an understanding between a human and her pet,” she said. ”They love each other so much and are capable of understanding each other with just one look.” Bego Anton is a Spanish photographer.

41430,60358,28  Internet acronyms every parent should know,CNN,,2014-12-08,2014.0,12.0,," (CNN) If you think you are tech savvy all because you know what ”LOL” means, let me test your coolness. Any idea what ”IWSN” stands for in Internet slang? It’s a declarative statement: I want sex now. If it makes you feel any better, I had no clue, and neither did a number of women I asked about it. Acronyms are widely popular across the Internet, especially on social media and texting apps, because, in some cases, they offer a shorthand for communication that is meant to be instant. READ: Chances are, your teen has sexted, So ”LMK”    let me know    and ”WYCM”    will you call me?    are innocent enough. But the issue, especially for parents, is understanding the slang that could signal some dangerous teen behavior, such as ”GNOC,’” which means ”get naked on camera.” And it certainly helps for a parent to know that ”PIR” means parent in room, which could mean the teen wants to have a conversation about things that his or her mom and dad might not approve of. Katie Greer is a national Internet safety expert who has provided Internet and technology safety training to schools, law enforcement agencies and community organizations throughout the country for more than seven years. She says research shows that a majority of teens believe that their parents are starting to keep tabs on their online and social media lives. ”With that, acronyms can be used by kids to hide certain parts of their conversations from attentive parents,” Greer said. ”Acronyms used for this purpose could potentially raise some red flags for parents.” READ: 10 signs you might be addicted to your smartphone, But parents would drive themselves crazy, she said, if they tried to decode every text, email and post they see their teen sending or receiving. ”I’ve seen some before and it’s like ’The Da Vinci Code,’ where only the kids hold the true meanings (and most of the time they’re fairly innocuous),” she said. Still, if parents come across any acronyms they believe could be problematic, they should talk with their kids about them, said Greer. But how, on earth, is a parent to keep up with all these acronyms, especially since new ones are being introduced every day? ”It’s a lot to keep track of,” Greer said. Parents can always do a Google search if they stumble upon an phrase they aren’t familiar with, but the other option is asking their children, since these phrases can have different meanings for different people.  ”Asking kids not only gives you great information, but it shows that you’re paying attention and sparks the conversation around their online behaviors, which is imperative.” READ: Teen ’like’ and FOMO anxiety  Micky Morrison, a mom of two in Islamorada, Florida, says she finds Internet acronyms ”baffling, annoying and hilarious at the same time.” She’s none too pleased that acronyms like ”LOL” and ”OMG” are being adopted into conversation, and already told her    son    whom she jokingly calls ”deprived,” since he does not have a phone yet    that acronym talk is not allowed in her presence. But the issue really came to a head when her son and his adolescent friends got together and were all ”ignoring one another with noses in their phones,” said Morrison, founder of BabyWeightTV. ”I announced my invention of a new acronym: ’PYFPD.’  Put your freaking phone down.” LOL! But back to the serious issue at hand, below are 28 Internet acronyms, which I learned from Greer and other parents I talked with, as well as from sites such as NoSlang. com and NetLingo. com, and from Cool Mom Tech’s 99 acronyms and phrases that every parent should know. After you read this list, you’ll likely start looking at your teen’s texts in a whole new way. 1.  IWSN   I want sex now, 2.  GNOC   Get naked on camera, 3.  NIFOC   Naked in front of computer, 4.

41687,60621,Why I refuse to see ’American Sniper’ (Opinion),CNN,Karen Spears Zacharias,2015-01-20,2015.0,1.0,," (CNN)”American Sniper” stormed the box office this past weekend with $105 million in ticket sales. Not since the Rambo movies have so many farmers and ranch hands   to the popcorn counter. As much as I adore Bradley Cooper, I won’t be seeing the movie. I can’t see it. And my reluctance to see it has nothing to do with Michael Moore’s flippant assertion that snipers are cowards (although he said he wasn’t talking about the movie). I was always taught that cowards are those who refuse to serve their country. Friends who’ve seen the movie say I’m missing out. They say it is an accurate portrayal of what happens in war.  One friend, who declares herself as a pacifist, urged me to go. ”Far from glorifying war, it made war look brutal, and a means of destroying people for life,” she said.  What I keep wondering is why all these moviegoers  weren’t  lining up to volunteer for war. Before his ironic death, Chris Kyle, on whom the movie is based, denounced Hollywood’s version of war. ”Hollywood fantasizes about it and makes it look good. It    war sucks,” he told Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly in 2012. Clint Eastwood deserves credit for the truth he does show. Women and children are killed more often than Americans like to consider. And good soldiers are always haunted by the comrades they couldn’t save. I know. The surgeon who tried to save my soldier father in Vietnam’s Ia Drang Valley still considers July 24, 1966, one of the worst days of his life. The men who were there that day tell me that my father grabbed Doc’s arm and begged him, ”Don’t let me die.” Doc did his best to save my father. I have thanked him for that. Still, he regrets that he didn’t save him, and I hate that he lives with that. Maybe that’s why I can’t see the movie. When you have experienced firsthand the multitude of ways war wreaks havoc on families, you have little tolerance for the mythmaking that war always seems to invoke. Not to mention the patriotic, almost nationalistic fervor that accompanies a   coffin. Related: Why ’American Sniper’ is a smash hit, When my father died there were no crowds gathered at Cowboys Stadium, no JumboTron displaying pictures of the family man my father was, and no   stories. There was just a broken family feeling very abandoned by an ungrateful nation. The other reason I can’t see the movie is my friend Sgt. Gordon Wofford. Gordon was serving with 9th Infantry Regiment (Manchu) 25th Infantry Division when he was struck by a sniper’s bullet on May 28, 1970. The bullet took out his lower jaw and all of his teeth. The company medic, Spec. Ronald Krebsbach, was killed by the next bullet while yanking Gordon to safety. Gordon spent 19 months at Walter Reed relearning skills toddlers know: How to chew. How to talk. How not to slobber all over himself. When I met him in 2005, Gordon was not getting help for his   stress disorder. He didn’t think he deserved benefits.  Before his death from cancer in 2009, Gordon and I forged a friendship from our experiences in war    his as a soldier, mine as a Gold Star daughter. Every day as he went through the motions of putting in a set of false teeth, Gordon remembered  the sniper he so longed to forget. Krebsbach, the medic, left behind a young pregnant wife. That always haunted Gordon. He felt bad that he had lived and Krebsbach had died. I serve on a couple of boards of national organizations for veterans. I know by name the men and women who have suffered the aftermath of war. They are not fictional characters to me. Their numbers are in my cell phone. I have wept with them at the Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington and at graves at Arlington National Cemetery. I have buried my Gold Star mother beside the only man she ever loved, my father. Why ’American Sniper’ is a smash hit, Hollywood has a way of fictionalizing war, of making it all about ”us” and ”them.” ”Ragheads” was one of the names Kyle gave to the Iraqi people. He said he didn’t give a ”flying f**k about the Iraqis.” Kyle dehumanized them. He had to. That’s how the military trains snipers like him. ”Every person I killed I strongly believe that they were bad,” Kyle told the BBC. I have traveled to my father’s battlefield in Vietnam and I have befriended Vietnamese who lost even more than I did during the war.  I have learned there is no ”us” and ”them.” There is only ”us.” Humanity.  All of us. I wish Hollywood would make a war movie that gets that point across. Read CNNOpinion’s new Flipboard magazine.

42243,61186,"Brighton Beach, a place like no other",CNN,Jamie Gumbrecht,2015-02-20,2015.0,2.0,," (CNN) Bruce Gilden was tired. He’s 68, and he had just returned to New York from an assignment in South Africa. Next up were England, Hong Kong, Tokyo.  Some assignments, some locations, are better than others.  In a surprisingly warm stretch of October, the photographer shot an assignment in Brighton Beach, a neighborhood not terribly far from his apartment in Manhattan. He liked that. He could spend four days there but go home at night to see his wife and pet his cats. He knows the place well, too. He grew up in Brooklyn and Queens and spent years shooting around Coney Island. This stretch of Brooklyn has changed since then, as all things do, but it’s still special, still a beloved place to dip a toe in the Atlantic. It maintained its individuality, Gilden says. It’s not like where he lives    the same   apartment in SoHo where he has stayed for decades. It changed around him into people who all seem to dress and act the same. ”Here, a guy gets a job on Wall Street, where’s the struggle?” Gilden said. ”I’m not interested, visually.” But Brighton Beach is something else. His wife loves to go there to swim, or buy tchotchkes and fancy mustard. If he had to pick a location for a fashion shoot, it’d be there.  The neighborhood was pretty Russian all those years ago. Now, he says, it’s all Russian. Jewish and Ukrainian, too, but really Russian. He can’t read the signs. You ask the time, and folks will show you their watch rather than say the words. Last October, he brought a translator along because so few people speak English    or at least, he says, they pretend they don’t.  He wandered the streets below the elevated train with a small Leica camera, and he snapped photos when he spotted a character. It’s not too crowded, and most people were very nice. Some wanted to take his head off. After years of shooting gangsters, revelers and whoever happens to be out and about, it all unfolds so quickly that almost nobody makes a fuss, he says. ”I have very good bedside manner from all the years on the streets,” Gilden said. ”It’s like playing sports. You don’t have time to think. You act and react. ”I shoot what’s interesting. All I’m about is visual.”  And Brighton Beach is a sight. For decades, Gilden shot in black and white. For the last two years, he says, he sees in color. Brighton Beach has it all    wild prints on shirts and dresses, fluorescent bathing suits that don’t exactly fit, garish makeup that’s been lovingly applied the same way for 50 years. ”I shoot who I am,” Gilden said. ”And I shoot what interests me, even when people hire me. I’ll get the job done, but I have a lot of energy in my pictures. With those people, there’s a lot of energy. They’re shopping, shopping, shopping. They go with their carts, and their red lipstick and their bright clothes.” Brighton Beach? Sure, it’s close to home. But, Gilden says, ”it’s an assignment that I liked.”"
42338,61281,’Blade Runner’ sequel to star Harrison Ford,CNN,,2015-02-27,2015.0,2.0,," (CNN) Harrison Ford will reprise his role as Rick Deckard in the ”Blade Runner” sequel. ”Prisoners” director Denis Villeneuve is in talks to helm the Alcon Entertainment film. The film is scheduled to start principle photography in the summer of 2016. Hampton Fancher, who   the original, and Michael Green have written the screenplay, which is based on an idea from Fancher and Ridley Scott. The story takes place several decades after the conclusion of the 1982 original, which centered on a man (Ford) working as a blade runner who was tasked with chasing down machines called replicants. Alcon Entertainment acquired the rights to ”Blade Runner” in 2011 with the intention of making both prequels and sequels to the iconic   thriller. Bud Yorkin will serve as a producer on the sequel along with Alcon   Andrew A. Kosove and Broderick Johnson. Frank Giustra and Tim Gamble, CEOs of Thunderbird Films, will serve as executive producers. Villeneuve most recently directed the crime thriller Sicario, staring Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro. He also directed Canada’s     film ”Incendies” and ”Prisoners,” staring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Ford next will be seen in Lionsgate’s ”The Age of Adaline” and will reprise his role as Han Solo in ”Disney’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” He’s repped by UTA."

43389,62338,Paddy Power backtracks over ’beatings’ tweet,CNN,,2015-04-13,2015.0,4.0,," (CNN) Irish betting company Paddy Power is backtracking after tweeting that ”Newcastle have suffered more Kop beatings over the last 20 years than an unarmed   male.” The tweet, a pun on the name of the famous home end at Liverpool Football Club, alluded to recent controversial incidents in the United States in which unarmed   men have been killed by police. Paddy Power      for its use of publicity stunts    used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between Liverpool and Newcastle United ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday.  A Paddy Power spokesman told CNN before Liverpool’s   victory at Anfield: ”It was a joke, and no offense was meant.” The tweet has since been deleted, but its removal    along with the statement    did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization, with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked. In January, Paddy Power attracted headlines after backing David Ginola’s failed candidacy for the presidency of world football’s governing body. The former Paris   and Tottenham player could not persuade enough FIFA football associations to back his bid. He needed five to have any chance of unseating Sepp Blatter. Paddy Power started the funding for the candidacy, but its penchant for publicity stunts quickly led many people to dismiss Ginola’s bid as another attempt to grab headlines. Paddy Power, the son of one the company’s founders and its marketing spokesman, explained: ”We’ve been known for some mischievous activity around the world. This is not that. This is for real.” Last year, the company generated anger when it promised ”money back if he walks” in relation to the trial of disgraced South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius. Monday’s win put Liverpool fifth in the table, four points behind defending champion Manchester City, which holds England’s final European Champions League qualification spot with six games left to play this season. Young England forward Raheem Sterling, who has turned down a new contract, scored a fine solo goal in the first half, and midfielder Joe Allen’s   strike condemned   Newcastle to a fifth successive league defeat. Newcastle, which had France international midfielder Moussa Sissoko sent off in the 83rd minute, has not won at Anfield since a   victory in the League Cup in November 1995.

43764,62716,Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz rehearsed descent,CNN,Laura Smith-Spark,2015-05-06,2015.0,5.0,," (CNN) Germanwings    Andreas Lubitz rehearsed putting his aircraft into a controlled descent on the flight that preceded the crash of his jetliner into the French Alps on March 24, according to an interim report Wednesday by French air accident investigators. The report by the French air accident investigation agency, the BEA, is based on analysis of the aircraft’s flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. This indicates that on the flight out from Germany to Spain, ”Several altitude selections towards 100 ft were recorded during descent on the flight that preceded the accident flight, while the   was alone in the cockpit.” The data recorders indicate the captain had left Lubitz alone on the flight deck for less than five minutes. On the return flight the same morning from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, Germany, Lubitz is accused of purposely slamming Germanwings Flight 9525 into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board, while the captain was locked out of the cockpit. The   refused to let the captain   and failed to respond to repeated contacts from air traffic controllers as the plane made its fatal descent. Lubitz suffered from bouts of depression and the incident sparked a global debate over how to monitor the mental health of pilots. Changing altitude settings, The preliminary BEA report details what happened on board the Airbus A320 on both the outbound and return flights. The report and a Germanwings spokesperson both indicate that the same six crew members were on both legs of the trip. While Lubitz was alone on the flight deck on the outbound flight, he was asked to bring the plane down to a lower altitude. At one point, ”the selected altitude decreased to 100 ft for three seconds and then increased to the maximum value of 49, 000 ft and stabilized again at 35, 000 ft,” the report said. Less than two minutes later, ”the selected altitude was 100 feet most of the time and changed several times until it stabilized at 25, 000 ft.”  At this point the captain buzzed to   the cockpit and the flight continued as planned to Barcelona. Because he had already been asked to descend, Lubitz’s apparent rehearsal of different altitude settings would have gone unnoticed by air traffic controllers since he did not diverge from the flight plan. FAA questioned Germanwings pilot’s health, Analyst: ’It was a dry run’ Asked if there could be any innocent interpretation of the recorded events, CNN aviation analyst Miles O’Brien said, ”It was a dry run, there’s no question.” Despite the wildly different altitude selections, he said, the plane’s altitude was going down at a steady rate, so the captain and air traffic controllers would not have been alerted to what Lubitz was doing. He was presumably testing the parameters of what the aircraft’s systems would allow, said O’Brien.  ”On the Airbus, you have a computer system that tends to overrule what the pilot wants to do if it’s outside the boundaries of acceptability for the aircraft and safety, and so this would be a good way to test where the alarm bells might go off, so you could set the selection for the intent, which of course we all know what happened,” he said. Lubitz called unfit to work, Violent blows on cockpit door, The report also provides chilling detail of the final minutes in the cockpit on the return flight before the crash. During the fatal descent, French air traffic controllers called the flight crew 11 times on three different frequencies without any response, it said. The French military defense system also tried three times to contact the aircraft, without any answer.  The    captain, who had left the cockpit after the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38, 000 feet, buzzed to   the cockpit just over four minutes later. The cockpit voice recorder then picks up what sounds like knocking on the door half a dozen times, the sound of a muffled voice asking for the door to be opened, and then what sounds like repeated violent blows on the door. The plane crashes into the mountainside about half a minute later."
44129,63087,Mental illness is no crime,CNN,,2015-05-27,2015.0,5.0,," (CNN) Before Paton Blough got his bipolar disorder under control, it nearly cost him everything. The Greenville, South Carolina, resident was arrested six times in three years, each for an episode related to his illness. Instead of receiving treatment, he was thrown in jail. In the rough prison environment and without proper treatment, he ended up with two felony convictions for crimes committed while incarcerated.  Blough managed to find a path to treatment. That makes him one of the lucky ones. Today, mentally ill Americans are disproportionately more likely to be arrested, incarcerated, suffer solitary confinement or rape in prison and commit another crime once released. Quick: Name the largest provider of mental health care in America. If you guessed ”our prisons and jails,” you would be right.  A 2006 U. S. Department of Justice study found that three out of four female inmates in state prisons, 64% of all people in jail, 56% of all state prison inmates and 45% of people in federal prison have symptoms or a history of mental disorder.  America’s approach when the mentally ill commit nonviolent crimes    locking them up without addressing the problem    is a solution straight out of the 1800s.  When governments closed   psychiatric facilities in the late 1970s, it didn’t replace them with community care, and by default, the mentally ill often ended up in jails. There are roughly as many people in Anchorage, Alaska, or Trenton, New Jersey, as there are inmates with severe mental illness in American prisons and jails, according to one 2012 estimate. The estimated number of inmates with mental illness outstrips the number of patients in state psychiatric hospitals by a factor of 10.  Today, in 44 states and the District of Columbia, the largest prison or jail holds more people with serious mental illness than the largest psychiatric hospital.  With 2 million people with mental illness booked into jails each year, it is not surprising that the biggest mental health providers in the country are LA County Jail, Rikers Island in New York and Cook County Jail in Chicago.  Our system is unfair to those struggling with mental illness.  Cycling them through the criminal justice system, we miss opportunities to link them to treatment that could lead to drastic improvements in their quality of life and our public safety. These people are sick, not bad, and they can be diverted to mental health programs that cost less and are more effective than jail time. People who’ve committed nonviolent crimes can often set themselves on a better path if they are provided with proper treatment. The current situation is also unfair to law enforcement officers and to the people running our prisons, who are now forced to act as doctors or face tense confrontations with the mentally ill while weighing the risk to public safety.  In fact, at a time when police shootings are generating mass controversy, there is far too little discussion of the fact that when police use force, it often involves someone with a mental illness. Finally, the current approach is unfair to taxpayers, because there are far more   ways for a decent society to provide care to the mentally ill. Just look at Ohio, where the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction is projected to spend $49 million this year on medications and mental health care, on top of nearly $23, 000 per inmate per year. Paton Blough is proof that there is a better way. After eventually getting the treatment he needed, he is out of jail and now helps teach law enforcement officers effective ways to intervene with people with mental health needs.  His focus is just one of a surprising number of proven, effective solutions with broad support. Both advocates for the mentally ill and the law enforcement community have lined up in support of increased training for officers. The psychiatric community as well as those focused on reducing crime can all agree on expanding mental health courts, crisis intervention teams, and veterans’ courts. A new initiative, ”Stepping Up,” unites state and local governments and the American Psychiatric Foundation to promote   practices to tackle our overreliance on jail as mental health treatment, such as   counseling programs that reduce the chances of repeat offenders. State and local officials have shown us the way.  We’ve seen large communities such as   County, Florida, completely redesign their systems at every level, training police officers in crisis intervention, instituting careful assessments of new jail admissions and redirecting their mentally ill populations into treatment, effectively reducing the rates of  .  We’ve seen smaller rural counties faced with tight budgets collaborate with neighboring communities to pool their limited resources to pay for new programs and properly track progress to promote accountability. Perhaps most surprisingly in these partisan times, Republicans and Democrats in Congress are standing    to support mental health reform. The bipartisan Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act,   by Sen. Al Franken,   and Sen. John Cornyn,   in the Senate, passed unanimously out of the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month. The legislation includes simple measures that would fund alternatives to jail and prison admissions for those in need of treatment and expand training programs for law enforcement personnel on how to respond to people experiencing a mental health crisis. The notion of bipartisan, comprehensive criminal justice reform is not just idle talk. It is happening. Both sides see practical alternatives to incarceration that can reduce prison populations, improve public safety, save lives and save money. If Congress moves swiftly to pass the great ideas now percolating in the House and Senate, it will become a reality. Take it from a conservative and a liberal: A good place to start is by addressing the needs of our mentally ill citizens in jails and prisons.   Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

44621,63586,McKinney pool party incident was about race,CNN,,2015-06-09,2015.0,6.0,," (CNN) The McKinney, Texas, swimming pool incident, which blew up into a national news story via a   video shot by a witness, reminds me of the movie ”Rashomon,” where a single event is told from varying and conflicting perspectives.   In one telling of the McKinney story, Officer Eric Casebolt pulls a      girl to the ground and kneels on her back to restrain her, maybe raising some concern, but he was justified under the circumstances.  Viewers and other witnesses who took away that version of the story from the   incident say this has nothing to do with race, even though it was a white police officer and everyone being ”policed” was black. One woman interviewed by CNN said about Casebolt: ”I think he deserves a medal for what he did.” She supports his drawing his weapon on the teenagers because ”he was being attacked from behind.”  Besides, goes this version of the story, there was a mob of teenagers who did not leave when the officer asked them to, but defiantly stood there watching and filming. If there weren’t so many of them and if they had listened to Casebolt, who was just doing his job of protecting the community, then none of this would have happened. In other words, the mob’s behavior was the root cause of this mess.  Another view of the incident and the video?  A white,    police officer sees a group of black teenagers, thinks ”thugs” and responds accordingly. They see Casebolt yelling at the top of his lungs and cursing at children. Yes, children. This was no mob this was a group of teens hanging out together having some harmless fun at the pool.  Most of the kids were polite. They said ”sir” when speaking to the police. Yet Casebolt appeared angry beyond belief, yelling at children about his having to run in the hot sun. Instead of   the situation, he made things worse. When the    was sitting on the ground, he told her ”on your face.” In this version of the story, a grown man picks up a child and pushes her on the ground facedown.  She is thoroughly subdued, but he continues to kneel on her back. Viewers see the officer purposely humiliating a    girl who is doing nothing wrong    and is asking for her mother. When did that become a crime? They see her friends trying to help her and Casebolt drawing his weapon in response. They think it is a miracle that no one got shot. Who’s right?  I want to start with a different question: If the    had blond hair and blue eyes and all the other children were white, would this movie have a different ending? If you answer this question with a yes, then race had something to do with it. If you answer the question with a no, then you don’t think race is a factor    but you would also be delusional. Watch the video. Here’s how the white movie would play out. First, it is quite possible that the 911 call is never made.  Second, if 911 is called, Casebolt doesn’t view the kids as thugs, but he sees them as his own children, or his nieces and nephews and talks to them appropriately. If the teenagers don’t obey his command, nobody thinks anything of it. What teenager ever listens to authority?  Nothing to see here no video no movie and most importantly no cop suspended, no career in jeopardy. Race had everything to do with McKinney, Texas, but the movie had a happy ending. The   ’s family is not planning a funeral today. We can all be thankful for that. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook. .  Read CNNOpinion’s Flipboard magazine. "
44663,63628,How escaped killers will give themselves away,CNN,,2015-06-10,2015.0,6.0,," (CNN) The question on everyone’s mind is: What are the chances that the two escaped murderers from the Dannemora prison can stay on the loose? The answer, as we learned over more than 20 years of chasing fugitives at ”America’s Most Wanted”: In the very short run, their chances are pretty good. But in the     run, almost nil. One thing we gleaned from all the manhunts we were part of is the simple fact that, let’s face it, fugitives are not the smartest people in the world. That’s how they got to be fugitives in the first place.  It takes enormous luck, incredible planning and meticulous attention to detail to remain a fugitive. Most of the fugitives we went after, if they weren’t caught by the show, managed to get themselves caught pretty quickly on their own.  They ran a red light, had a taillight out, used a stolen credit card and got caught on a   surveillance camera, walked into a coffee shop where the waitress happened to be looking at their pictures on a website, or got into a bar fight at the wrong place at the wrong time. One false move and some cop, somewhere, is going to run a fingerprint, or make a visual connection, and the jig is up. And even if they do try to watch their every step, it’s not enough. In one case, a fugitive’s overly cautious demeanor was what gave him away. He started dating a girl whose father noticed that he never drove over 55, always came to a full stop at every stop sign, carefully fed every parking meter, always wore his seat belt. ”Nobody’s that careful,” the dad told us. ”Unless they have something to hide.” So even the most careful fugitives manage, sooner rather than later, to get themselves caught. And if we know anything about Richard Matt and David Sweat, it’s that they are not cautious, methodical, careful, thoughtful individuals. Despite a   and   escape, they are, from all reports, total lunatics.  Sweat was serving a life sentence without parole for killing Broome County Sheriff’s Deputy Kevin Tarsia in 2002. But shooting him 15 times wasn’t enough. He decided to run him over with a car.  Matt was convicted for kidnapping a businessman for 27 hours and    when the victim didn’t comply with his demands for money    killing him. And not just killing him: A man who drove a car for one of Matt’s victims told Anderson Cooper that Matt shoved a knife sharpener in his victim’s ear, broke his neck and then dismembered the body.  These are not calm individuals at work. It is easier for fugitives to stay on the loose in the summer than it is in the winter but they still have to eat, they probably will want to drink, and these two are unlikely to be the kinds of survivalists who can patiently wait out the summer in the woods until the heat dies down. And from experience, it doesn’t seem likely that the heat will die down on this case. There are two things that motivate the public, and the police, to maintain a manhunt. One is sympathy for the victim: Everyone wants to see justice done. The other is fear: The belief that the fugitives, if not caught, will kill again. It doesn’t appear that the sympathy aspect has taken hold in this case: Sad to say, there have been few stories about the victims, about the families they left behind, the partners and parents and friends for whom this escape is a terribly, painfully personal affront. We learned that sharing those stories can be a powerful motivator. But so is fear, and in this case, that is justified. These are men who have clearly shown that they are ruled by ruthlessness and rage    and that is plenty of motivation for making sure this story doesn’t fade away, as too many fugitive stories do. The $100, 000 reward won’t hurt, either. Some have surmised that these two men must have help on the outside. That can make a difference    but not as much as you think. Witness their purported getaway driver who, according to CNN sources, had an anxiety attack before the escape, and went to the hospital instead of the pickup point. It takes a really good friend to harbor you as a fugitive    and these don’t sound like the kinds of guys who make friends easily. There are always exceptions to the rule. We can name several fugitives who stayed on the run for a dozen years or more (I’m looking at you, Whitey Bulger).  But those tend to be   men with   operations. Not a couple of crazed fugitives on the run without a car or a bankroll.  The odds are stacked against them. Let’s just hope the odds play out before anyone else gets hurt.

47084,66249,A top LinkedIn exec says the Dalai Lama parable CEO Jeff Weiner told him  at their first meeting changed his management style,Business Insider,Richard Feloni,2017-04-02,2017.0,4.0,,"’  ’ ”   Mike Gamson is one of LinkedIn’s top executives. ” ”   As the SVP of Global Solutions, Gamson is in charge of the global   talent, marketing, sales, and learning teams, making him   responsible for about half of LinkedIn’s roughly 10, 000   employees. He works closely with CEO Jeff Weiner. ” ’   Gamson told Business Insider that he follows Weiner’’s   philosophy of ”compassionate leadership” very closely, but his   first meeting with Weiner, he didn’’t know what to expect. ’ ’   It was the end of 2008, and LinkedIn founder and chairman Reid   Hoffman had replaced his chief executive Dan Nye with   Weiner, who had been an EVP at Yahoo. Nye was a close friend,   mentor, and former boss to Gamson, and had recruited him to the   professional social network company a year earlier. ’ ’   On top of that, Gamson was dealing with the stress of a new   baby at home coupled with constant   travel. ”So when   I flew in to meet Jeff, it was actually a pretty emotional time   for me,” Gamson told Business Insider. ’ ”   When he walked into Weiner’s office, he said, it still felt like   it was Nye’s. He didn’t know how their conversation would play   out. ” ’   After a warm greeting, Weiner asked him what type of leader he   aspired to be.  ’ ’   ”I said, ’’An empathetic leader,’’” Gamson said. ”I’’d been working   on empathy. And he said, ’’Why empathy and not compassion? ’’”   Gamson admitted to Weiner he didn’’t know the nuances of the   definitions enough to give an adequate answer. ’ ”   That’s when Weiner told a parable told by the Dalai Lama.   While that may sound like a stereotypical Silicon Valley CEO   move, the ensuing   conversation fundamentally changed the   way Gamson would go on to manage. ” ’  ’ ”   The parable: A man is lying on the side of a road, crushed by a   boulder. An empathetic person passes by. This person feels the   man’s suffering so intimately they are shaken and unable to find   a way to help. A compassionate person passes by. This person   understands the man’s pain and is driven to help, but   is able to remain centered within themselves, allowing them   to devise a plan to remove the boulder and get the man help. ” ”   The lesson: Empathy is feeling someone’s state as if it were your   own, manifested emotionally; compassion is understanding   someone’s state as if it were your own, but with a layer of   detachment. It is better to go through the world as a   compassionate person, able to confront the plights of others   without being crippled by their weight. And it is better to lead   with compassion, not empathy. ” ’   ”If you can picture that in a very practical sense as a manager,   there’’s constantly things that happen that are very emotionally   charged,” Gamson said. ”Where someone can come to you not   centered about whatever is going on in their life, an empathetic   leader will resonate with that person and two emotionally charged   people are less likely to resolve something than someone who can   understand the context, ask the question, look at the world   through their eyes, and then stay centered to be helpful.” ’ ”   And this isn’t all about feelings, Gamson explained  —   it’s also   just good business. He said he saw Weiner’s approach in action   when they worked together on the biggest deal the company had   seen to date, early in Weiner’s tenure. The two executives met to   discuss how they should negotiate the deal, and Gamson asked   how they could get the most out of it. ” ’   ”And when I was walking Jeff through the deal mechanics, he   corrected me and he said, ’’Well, let’’s put ourselves in their   shoes, let’’s figure out the way we can make this the best deal   for both of us,’’” Gamson said. ”Because there’’s going to be no   long term health in a relationship unless value is distributed   equally.” His point was that long term value should not be   sacrificed for short term gain, and that the way to long term   value was through building a relationship with the client, and   the way to that was through compassion, not empathy (or enmity,   for that matter).

51254,71065,Why Georgia is turning purple,Business Insider,,2016-08-14,2016.0,8.0,,"’  ’ ’   Since the end of the Democratic National Convention, Hillary   Clinton has been riding high in the polls nationally, in swing   states, and in a few places that should give Republicans cause   for real alarm. ’ ’   One of those places is Georgia, a state that hasn’t voted for a   Democratic presidential candidate since 1992. ’ ’   After months of a slim Trump lead in the state, two recent polls   show Clinton ahead. ’ ’   The latest, a  poll of likely   voters, shows Clinton up by a remarkable 7 percentage points. ’ ’   Although  in   FiveThirtyEight’s pollster rankings,   FiveThirtyEight’s own   forecasting model   suggests that a Clinton lead in Georgia could very well be real;   it currently gives her a  chance of winning   the state. ’ ’     Clinton likely owes much of her current standing in the state’s     polls to a highly successful convention and a highly damaging     couple of weeks for Donald Trump. But there’s also reason to     believe that deep changes in Georgia’s demographics are     boosting her support and could turn Georgia purple soon, if not     this November.   ’ ’       The changes that have taken place in Georgia mirror the kinds       of changes that have put into play other formerly solid       Republican states in the South, like Virginia and North       Carolina. As with these states, Georgia’ population has been       growing and diversifying.     ’ ’       In 2000, roughly 63 percent of Georgians were .  an estimated 54 percent       are, the result of a Latino population that has grown from       roughly 5 percent to more than 9 percent, a black population       that has grown from 29 percent to 31 percent, and an Asian       population that has grown from roughly 2 percent to 4       percent.     ’ ’       These numbers are driven, as is also the case in the new       swing states, by a changing economy. Urban centers like       Atlanta and the industries based in them like tech and health       care are growing, which is  migration to       Georgia not just from abroad, but also from elsewhere in the       country.     ’ ’       According to the Census Bureau, Georgia was one of the top 10        for Americans       moving to another state between 2010 and 2015.     ’ ’  ’ ’       These factors motivated a significant investment of resources       by Democrats in Georgia’s 2014 Senate race. Michelle Nunn, a       nonprofit executive and daughter of former Georgia Sen. Sam       Nunn, was thought to have a  at beating then —  Republican       candidate David Perdue. Her chances were contingent on Nunn       turning out Latino and black voters, including some of the       700, 000 black Georgians who were eligible to vote but       unregistered at the time.     ’ ’       This seemed like a real possibility. The trajectory of voter       registrations since 2000 suggested as much —   new       nonwhite voters registered between 2000 and 2014 compared       with just over 111, 000 new white voters —  and in 2014, Stacey       Abrams, Georgia’s house minority leader, launched  an ambitious effort       to register minorities. But in the end, Nunn  to Perdue roughly 53       percent to 45 percent.     ’ ’       “Nunn’s main problem in 2014 was simple: turnout,       particularly turnout among the Democratic base,” says Tharon       Johnson, a veteran Democratic strategist in Georgia. “She did       not do enough to motivate that base nor did she do enough to       appeal to the hundreds of thousands of historically white       Democratic voters who have not voted for a Democrat statewide       since 2002. ”     ’ ’       Indeed, Nunn won 26 percent of the white vote, short of the              her campaign estimated she would need to have a real chance       of winning. Her loss in 2014 and the returns from 2012, in       which Obama lost Georgia by roughly the same margin and did        with white Georgians       than any Democratic candidate since 1972, show that whites       still must constitute a sizable part of any Democratic       coalition statewide, despite Georgia’s changing electoral       base.     ’ ’  ’ ’       Given Trump’s significant lead over Clinton with white voters       nationally and given the economic  of the         white voters in industrial sections of Georgia       outside the state’s growth centers, one might expect Trump       both to sweep the white voters Clinton would need and to       register many new ones.     ’ ’       As Nate Cohn  in 2014, it is often       forgotten that there are actually far more unregistered but       eligible white voters than there are unregistered but       eligible nonwhites.     ’ ’       But the latest polling from Georgia suggests that Clinton is       already doing better with white Georgians than Obama did in       either 2008 or 2012 and better than John Kerry did back in       2004 ’ ’tlanta         released on Friday       shows she’s losing Georgia whites by 37 percentage points.       That would seem abysmal        that Obama lost white Georgians by 60 points in  and by 54 points in       . Kerry also lost       whites by 54 points in 2004. ’ ’       It’s still unclear why Clinton seems to be doing relatively       well with white Georgians, but if these numbers hold and if       minorities turn out in droves, Clinton could have a very real       shot at winning the state.     ’ ’       Those are still big ifs. The state’s  might       well suppress minority turnout, and at the moment Clinton       isn’t even within striking distance of the Nunn campaign’s 30       percent target for white voters.     ’ ’       The Atlanta   poll shows       that Clinton currently has the support of 23 percent of       Georgia’s white voters in a straight    with Trump       and 20 percent of them with   candidates Gary       Johnson and Jill Stein included. Charles Bullock, a political       science professor at the University of Georgia who’s       monitored the state’s politics for decades, thinks that       difference is important.     ’ ’       “She’s going to have to count on libertarians siphoning off a       share of the white vote,” he says. “And that could happen.       Although polls this far out show   candidates doing       better than they actually do on election day. ”     ’ ’         Just  the Clinton         campaign told Georgia Democrats it would be hiring more         field organizers in the state, and the New Georgia Project         announced it has registered 70, 000 new minority voters this         year. These are both signs that Democratic organizing         efforts in Georgia will be serious, if small relative to         efforts in states more important to the electoral picture.       ’ ’         It’s plausible that these moves, combined with the effect         of the   candidates on the ticket and Democratic         turnout spurred by Trump’s anomalous candidacy, could be         enough to put Clinton just over the top. But it’s the         deep changes in Georgia’s makeup that have truly brought a         Clinton victory into the realm of possibility.       ’"

53521,73753,6-Year-Old Girls Already Have Gendered Beliefs About Intelligence,Atlantic,Ed Yong,2017-01-26,2017.0,1.0,,"Bian, a psychologist at the University of Illinois, read this story out to 240 children, aged 5 to 7. She then showed them pictures of four adults —  two men and two women —  and asked them to guess which was the protagonist of the story. She also gave them two further tests: one in which they had to guess which adult in a pair was “really, really smart” and another where they had to match attributes like “smart” or “nice” to pictures of unfamiliar men and women. The results were stark. Among the    both boys and girls associated brilliance with their own gender. But among those aged 6 or 7, only the boys still held to that view. At an age when girls tend to outperform boys at school, and when children in general show large positive biases towards their own   the girls became less likely than boys to attribute brilliance to their own gender. You could frame that as a good thing: While boys continued to believe in their own brilliance, the girls, on average, developed a more equal view. But that view has consequences —  Bian also found that the older girls were less interested in games that were meant for “really, really smart” children. “It was really heartbreaking,” she says. The stereotype that brilliance and genius are male traits is common among adults. In various surveys, men rate their intelligence more favorably than women, and in a recent study of biology undergraduates, men overrated the abilities of male students above equally talented and outspoken women. But Bian’s study shows that the seeds of this pernicious bias are planted at a very early age. Even by the age of 6, boys and girls are already diverging in who they think is smart. “It’s an excellent, important, and   paper,” says Alison Gopnik from the University of California, Berkeley, who studies the minds of babies and children. “The pattern it reports is very consistent with other studies which show the emergence of gender stereotypes at around age 6. ” These differences can have lasting consequences. In 2015, Bian’s colleagues   Leslie from Princeton University and Andrei Cimpian at New York University showed that in many academic fields, like physics, math, and philosophy, people believe that success depends on “raw, innate talent” that “just can’t be taught”. And as the team found, the greater the emphasis on this “brilliance required” message, the fewer female Ph. D.’s there were, and the bigger the gender gap. That’s not because of any actual differences in aptitude. Instead, the team argued, a double whammy of stereotypes —  that men are more likely to be brilliant, and that brilliance is required in some fields —  creates an atmosphere that makes women feel unwelcome, and pushes them away.   It begins early, Bian found. She offered 160 children a chance to play two new games —  one for children “who are really, really smart” and another for those who “try really, really hard”.  At the age of 5, girls and boys were equally attracted to both games. But among those aged 6 or older, the girls were less interested than the boys in the game for smart kids (but not the one for   ones). “They’d go from being really enthusiastic to saying: ‘Oh I don’t want to play it, this isn’t a game for me,’” says Bian. And those who had most strongly assimilated the stereotype of male brilliance showed the lowest interest in the smart game. They had already mentally assigned themselves to Hufflepuff instead of Ravenclaw. “The stereotype has an immediate impact,” she adds. “In the   it will steer away many young women from careers that are thought to require brilliance. ” “Unfortunately, this reveals another hurdle for efforts to recruit more women and girls into STEM,” says Sarah Eddy from Florida International University. “Not only do we need to break down the ‘science is male’ stereotype, but now we need to break down a ‘brilliance is male’ stereotype, too. ” Why do these beliefs occur? It’s not to do with actual ability. At that age, girls tend to outclass their male peers —  and the girls in Bian’s study knew it. When she showed them pictures of four children and asked them to guess who got the best grades, the older girls were actually more likely to pick girls than the older boys were to pick boys. “Everyone agreed that girls do better in school but that didn’t seem to matter,” says Bian. Why? “That’s something we’re investigating,” says Bian, “and the answer won’t be simple. ” Their parents, perhaps? Parents tend to think that their sons are brighter than their daughters, and they’re 2. 5 times more likely to do a google search for “Is my son gifted?” than “Is my daughter gifted?” Their teachers could be another font of stereotypes. So could the characters in the movies they see and the books they read. “We have to be more deliberate about presenting examples of brilliant women to girls and boys as young as five to help them avoid developing this association,” says Eddy. “Brilliant women exist, like Rosalind Franklin, Shirley Jackson, Ada Lovelace, Marie Curie, and Katherine G. Johnson, whose story is popularized in Hidden Figures.  We need to be talking about them more. ” “We can also emphasize the importance of hard work and effort in addition to brilliance,” says Bian. Psychologists like Carol Dweck have shown that many disadvantaged groups, including poor students and people of colour, suffer disproportionately from beliefs that intelligence is innate and fixed. “Simply changing disadvantaged   students’ perception of the malleability of IQ can cause substantial differences in   rates,” says Gopnik.   But Sapna Cheryan from the University of Washington notes that in Bian’s study, the    had a kind of gender arrogance, which persisted in the boys but disappeared in the girls. “Do we want a society where each gender thinks they are smarter, or do we want one where boys and girls think the genders are equally smart?” Cheryan asks. “If the latter, then it may be boys’ beliefs that we should try to change. ” “Similarly, do we want a society where people would rather play the game that requires being ‘being smart’ over the one that require ‘hard work? ’” she says. “We as a society should figure out what we value before concluding that it is the girls we need to change. ”"
54009,74392,Why Space Operas Will Never Come True,Atlantic,Michael Strauss ,2017-02-22,2017.0,2.0,,"Just how large the universe actually is never fails to boggle the mind. We say that the observable universe extends for tens of billions of light years, but the only way to really comprehend this, as humans, is to break matters down into a series of steps, starting with our visceral understanding of the size of the Earth. A   flight from Dubai to San Francisco covers a distance of about 8, 000 miles —  roughly equal to the diameter of the Earth. The Sun is much bigger its diameter is just over 100 times Earth’s. And the distance between the Earth and the Sun is about 100 times larger than that, close to 100 million miles. This distance, the radius of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, is a fundamental measure in astronomy the Astronomical Unit, or AU. The spacecraft Voyager 1, for example, launched in 1977 and, traveling at 11 miles per second, is now 137 AU from the Sun. But the stars are far more distant than this. The nearest, Proxima Centauri, is about 270, 000 AU, or 4. 25 light years away. You would have to line up 30 million Suns to span the gap between the Sun and Proxima Centauri. The Vogons in Douglas Adams’s The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (1979) are shocked that humans have not travelled to the Proxima Centauri system to see the Earth’s demolition notice the joke is just how impossibly large the distance is. Four light years turns out to be about the average distance between stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, of which the Sun is a member. That is a lot of empty space! The Milky Way contains about 300 billion stars, in a vast structure roughly 100, 000 light years in diameter. One of the truly exciting discoveries of the past two decades is that our Sun is far from unique in hosting a retinue of planets: Evidence shows that the majority of   stars in the Milky Way have planets orbiting them, many with a size and distance from their parent star allowing them to host life as we know it. Yet getting to these planets is another matter entirely: Voyager 1 would arrive at Proxima Centauri in 75, 000 years if it were traveling in the right direction —  which it isn’t.   writers use a variety of tricks to span these interstellar distances: putting their passengers into states of suspended animation during the long voyages, or traveling close to the speed of light (to take advantage of the time dilation predicted in Albert Einstein’s theory of special relativity). Or they invoke warp drives, wormholes, or other   undiscovered phenomena. When astronomers made the first definitive measurements of the scale of our Galaxy a century ago, they were overwhelmed by the size of the universe they had mapped. Initially, there was great skepticism that the   “spiral nebulae” seen in deep photographs of the sky were in fact ‘island universes’ —  structures as large as the Milky Way, but at much larger distances still. While the vast majority of   stories stay within our Milky Way, much of the story of the past 100 years of astronomy has been the discovery of just how much larger than that the universe is. Our nearest galactic neighbor is about 2 million light years away, while the light from the most distant galaxies our telescopes can see has been traveling to us for most of the age of the universe, about 13 billion years. We discovered in the 1920s that the universe has been expanding since the Big Bang. But about 20 years ago, astronomers found that this expansion was speeding up, driven by a force whose physical nature we do not understand, but to which we give the   name of “dark energy. ” Dark energy operates on   and   of the universe as a whole: How could we capture such a concept in a piece of fiction? The story doesn’t stop there. We can’t see galaxies from those parts of the universe for which there hasn’t been enough time since the Big Bang for the light to reach us. What lies beyond the observable bounds of the universe? Our simplest cosmological models suggest that the universe is uniform in its properties on the largest scales, and extends forever. A variant idea says that the Big Bang that birthed our universe is only one of a (possibly infinite) number of such explosions, and that the resulting “multiverse” has an extent utterly beyond our comprehension. The U. S. astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson once said: “The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you. ” Similarly, the wonders of the universe are under no obligation to make it easy for   writers to tell stories about them. The universe is mostly empty space, and the distances between stars in galaxies, and between galaxies in the universe, are incomprehensibly vast on human scales. Capturing the true scale of the Universe, while somehow tying it to human endeavors and emotions, is a daunting challenge for any   writer. Olaf Stapledon took up that challenge in his novel Star Maker (1937) in which the stars and nebulae, and cosmos as a whole, are conscious. While we are humbled by our tiny size relative to the cosmos, our brains can nonetheless comprehend, to some extent, just how large the universe we inhabit is. This is hopeful, since, as the astrobiologist Caleb Scharf of Columbia University has said: “In a finite world, a cosmic perspective isn’t a luxury, it is a necessity. ” Conveying this to the public is the real challenge faced by astronomers and   writers alike.

54522,75026,The Like Button Ruined the Internet,Atlantic,James Somers,2017-03-21,2017.0,3.0,,"I actually built my own Google Reader clone. (That’s part of the reason this friend and I became friends —  we both loved Reader that much.) But my version was more conservative: I never added any Like buttons, and I made it difficult to add pictures to comments. In fact, it’s so hard that I don’t think there has ever been a GIF on the site. I thought about building new social features into my clone until I heard my friend’s story. The first rule of social software design is that more engagement is better, and that the way you get engagement is by adding stuff like Like buttons and notifications. But the last thing I wanted was to somehow hurt the conversation that was happening, because the conversation was the whole reason for the thing. Google Reader was engaging, but it had few of the features we associate with engagement. It did a bad job of giving you feedback. You could, eventually, Like articles that people shared, but the Likes went into an abyss if you wanted to see new Likes come in, you had to scroll back through your share history, keeping track in your head of how many Likes each share had the last time you looked. The way you found out about new comments was similar: You navigated to reader. google. com and clicked the “Comments” link the comments page was poorly designed and it was hard to know exactly how many new comments there had been. When you posted a comment it was never clear that anyone liked it, let alone that they read it. When you are writing in the absence of feedback you have to rely on your own judgment. You want to please your audience, of course. But to do that you have to imagine what your audience will like, and since that’s hard, you end up leaning on what you like. Once other people start telling you what they like via Like buttons, you inevitably start hewing to their idea of what’s good. And since “people tend to be extremely similar in their vulgar and prurient and dumb interests and wildly different in their refined and aesthetic and noble interests,” the stuff you publish will start looking a lot like the stuff that everybody else publishes, because everybody sort of likes the same thing and everybody is fishing for Likes. What I liked about Reader was that not knowing what people liked gave you a peculiar kind of freedom. Maybe it’s better described as plausible deniability: You couldn’t be sure that your friends didn’t like your latest post, so your next post wasn’t constrained by what had previously done well or poorly in terms of a metric like Likes or Views. Your only guide was taste and a rather coarse model of your audience. Newspapers and magazines used to have a rather coarse model of their audience. It used to be that they couldn’t be sure how many people read each of their articles they couldn’t see on a dashboard how much social traction one piece got as against the others. They were more free to experiment, because it was never clear   what kind of article was likely to fail. This could, of course, lead to deeply indulgent work that no one would read but it could also lead to unexpected magic. Is it any coincidence that the race to the bottom in media —  toward clickbait headlines, toward the vulgar and prurient and dumb, toward provocative but often exaggerated takes —  has accelerated in   with the development of new technologies for measuring engagement? You don’t have to spend more than 10 minutes talking to a purveyor of content on the web to realize that the question keeping them up at night is how to improve the performance of their stories against some engagement metric. And it’s easy enough to see the logical consequence of this incentive: At the bottom of article pages on nearly every major content site is an “Around the Web” widget powered either by Outbrain or Taboola. These widgets are aggressively optimized for clicks. (People do, in fact, click on that stuff. I click on that stuff.) And you can see that it’s mostly sexy, sexist, and sensationalist garbage. The more you let engagement metrics drive editorial, the more your site will look like a Taboola widget. That’s the drain it all circles toward. And yet we keep designing software to give publishers better feedback about how their content is performing so that they can give people exactly what they want. This is true not just for regular media but for social media too —  so that even an    gets to develop a sophisticated sense of exactly what kind of post is going to net the most Likes. In the Google Reader days, when RSS ruled the web, online publications —  including blogs, which thrived because of it —  kept an eye on how many subscribers they had. That was the key metric. They paid less attention to individual posts. In that sense their content was bundled: It was like a magazine, where a collection of articles is literally bound together and it’s the collection that you’re paying for, and that you’re consuming. But, as the journalist Alexis Madrigal pointed out to me, media on the web has come increasingly   —  and we haven’t yet fully appreciated the consequences. When content is bundled, the burden is taken off of any one piece to make a splash the idea is for the bundle —  in an accretive way —  to make the splash. I think this has real consequences. I think creators of content bundles don’t have as much pressure on them to sex up individual stories. They can let stories be somewhat unattractive on their face, knowing that readers will find them anyway because they’re part of the bundle. There is room for narrative messiness, and for variety —  for stuff, for instance, that’s not always of the moment. Like an essay about how oranges are made so long that it has to be serialized in two parts. Conversely, when media is unbundled, which means each article has to justify its own existence in the    more pressure than most individual stories can bear is put on those individual stories. That’s why so much of what you read today online has an irresistible claim or question in the title that the body never manages to cash in. Articles have to be their own advertisements —  they can’t rely on the bundle to bring in readers —  and the best advertising is salacious and exaggerated. Madrigal suggested that the newest successful media bundle is the podcast. Perhaps that’s why podcasts have surged in popularity and why you find such a refreshing mixture of breadth and depth in that form: Individual episodes don’t matter what matters is getting subscribers. You can occasionally whiff, or do something weird, and still be successful. Imagine if podcasts were Twitterized in the sense that people cut up and reacted to individual segments, say a few minutes long. The content marketplace might shift away from the bundle —  shows that you subscribe to —  and toward individual fragments. The incentives would evolve toward producing fragments that get Likes. If that model came to dominate, such that the default was no longer to subscribe to any podcast in particular, it seems obvious that   shows devoted to niches would starve. * * * People aren’t using my Reader clone as much anymore. Part of it is that it’s just my friends on there, and my friends all have jobs now, and some of them have families, but part of it, I think, is that every other piece of software is so much more engaging, in the   dopaminergic way. The loping pace of a Reader conversation —  a few responses per day, from a few people, at the very best —  isn’t much match for what happens on Twitter or Facebook, where you start getting likes in the first few minutes after you post.

A   judge on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Colorado, Gorsuch has a legal resumé   for the Supreme Court, he’s won nearly universal praise from conservatives, and he emerged from his confirmation hearings with his reputation largely intact. The only question has been whether Gorsuch would win the eight Democratic votes necessary to reach 60 and defeat a filibuster, or whether Democratic resistance would force Republicans to change Senate rules, invoke what’s known in Washington as “the nuclear option,” and confirm Gorsuch with a simple majority of 51 votes. Statements of  opposition have flooded in from Democrats this week, making the answer clearer every day: Gorsuch is likely to fall short of 60 votes, and Republicans will have to jam his nomination through the Senate on their own. What Does Judge Gorsuch Believe? Will Republicans go nuclear? There’s little doubt that they will. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a man known inside the Capitol for choosing his words as carefully as anyone in politics, has not explicitly outlined how Republicans would respond to a Democratic filibuster. But his statements on the nomination have been so declarative, so free of hedging that they’ve left no question about his plans.  When McConnell said on Tuesday, “Judge Gorsuch is going to get confirmed,” it was less a prediction than a guarantee. McConnell’s determination is rooted in a simple reality: For Republicans in general and McConnell in particular, there is no higher political priority than maintaining a   conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Cutting taxes, repealing the Affordable Care Act, eliminating regulations, nor any of the promises they’ve made in recent elections come close. For a generation, the Court has been the right’s ultimate prize, so much so that McConnell engineered an unprecedented Republican blockade last year to deny former President Barack Obama a chance to fill Scalia’s seat with Merrick Garland, a nominee whose qualifications, on paper, matched those of Gorsuch. It is McConnell’s treatment of Garland that, more than anything else, has hardened the Democratic opposition to Gorsuch. The GOP’s denial of even a hearing for Obama’s nominee a year ago was seen as a galling, even cynical, break with Senate norms, but one that Democrats were confident voters would rectify with the election of Hillary Clinton. Trump’s victory last November, however, cast McConnell’s move in a new light, and liberal activists are demanding revenge for what they now consider a stolen Supreme Court seat. If at least 41 Democrats try to block a final vote on Gorsuch’s nomination, McConnell would need all but two of the GOP’s 52 senators to support a rules change lowering the threshold to end debate and defeat the filibuster. If executed, that move would remove an exception for the Supreme Court that Democrats left in place when they eliminated the   threshold for   and most judicial nominees when they held the majority in 2013. At the time, Democrats said a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court should still demand bipartisan support, forcing presidents to choose nominees that could achieve a consensus in the Senate. But the trend toward partisanship in court appointments, though lamented by both parties, has been building for decades, beginning with the defeat of President Ronald Reagan’s nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court in 1987. Justice Clarence Thomas won his seat with just 52 votes in 1991 (though, as Republicans now point out, Democrats allowed him an    vote without a filibuster). Democrats blocked   nominees of President George W. Bush, and Republicans did the same to Obama before   Leader Harry Reid led his caucus in invoking the nuclear option for most nominees. Had Clinton won the presidency with a Democratic majority in the Senate, Senator Tim Kaine, the   vice president, had already warned that Democrats would have changed the rules if Republicans tried to block her nominee for Scalia’s seat. Some Democratic senators initially considered making only a   effort to defeat Gorsuch, hoping to preserve the filibuster option for a future   vacancy that would actually shift the ideological balance on the bench. (Replacing Scalia with another conservative maintains the status quo.) Yet progressives ridiculed that idea. Republicans, they argued, would not hesitate to nuke the   threshold for any Trump nominee, so Democrats might as well force them to do it with Gorsuch. “McConnell will go nuclear at the first opportunity. There’s just no question,” said Adam Jentleson, a former top aide to Reid who is now a senior strategist at the Center for American Progress. Minority Leader Charles Schumer adopted that view in recent weeks, and so have most of his colleagues. Thirty of the party’s 48 members now support a filibuster against Gorsuch, including more moderate members like Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, who is up for reelection next year. McConnell has said the Senate will confirm Gorsuch by the end of next week, ahead of a   congressional recess. The Democratic arguments against Gorsuch have run the gamut. Many senators have gamely stuck to the view that he is simply too conservative a pick, citing his record as a jurist and as a political appointee in Republican administrations. Several members of the Judiciary Committee took issue with his performance at his hearings last week, which they found evasive and condescending, if not overly controversial. And others have called for the vote to be put off until the investigations of the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia have been completed, warning that a president whose legitimacy might be tainted should not get a lifetime appointment to the nation’s highest court. But mostly, the gathering Democratic opposition to Gorsuch is a reflection of the coarse political moment, as senators face pressure from an angry party base seething over the Republicans’ treatment of the martyred Garland and the likelihood that a president elected under a cloud of suspicion and without popular support will be able to secure a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for decades more to come. Their goal over the next weeks is to force even a few Republicans to think twice about Gorsuch and the precedent of confirming a nominee without bipartisan support. “The answer is not to change the rules. It’s to change the nominee,” Schumer said Wednesday. “We believe there are Republicans who are reluctant to change the rules, and we hope they won’t do it. ” While a few GOP senators, including John McCain of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, have voiced reservations about invoking the nuclear option to confirm Gorsuch, none have come out against it. “Feel no guilt,” McConnell told his members about the prospect, according to Politico. If Republicans appear to have the will to confirm Gorsuch by any means necessary, Democrats can at least try to take the sheen off Trump’s victory by painting it as another move flouting institutional norms. “It’s an ugly vote,” Jentleson said. But as polarization and partisanship have steadily overtaken the confirmation process, neither party is innocent. Democrats may have tried to preserve the filibuster for the Supreme Court four years ago, but they knew it probably wouldn’t last. They started the slide toward majority rule for nominees, and next week, they’ll likely make Republicans finish it."
54959,75604,Were College Students Better Off Before Social Media?,Atlantic,Conor Friedersdorf,2017-04-14,2017.0,4.0,,"I never realized how good that I had it. Or so I kept thinking when I returned to the Claremont Colleges this week. I was there for a panel discussion on campus speech that couldn’t have been more timely —  days before, protesters tried to shut down an appearance by Heather Mac Donald, the Manhattan Institute scholar who authored The War on Cops and regularly criticizes the Black Lives Matter movement. But the couple days that I spent wandering around campus, talking with perhaps three dozen students, left me more preoccupied with something I hadn’t fully appreciated. Silicon Valley innovations have changed nearly every community in America. Yet I wonder if residential colleges aren’t among the most profoundly changed. I wonder if social media and surveillance culture especially affect young learners. I wonder if the cost of making mistakes now feels too high to risk them as often. Nearly everyone I encountered at the five colleges was smart, thoughtful, and friendly, or at least  . But across racial, gender, and ideological lines, on gorgeous campuses where folks tend to like their professors and have lots of good things to say about their academic lives and friendships, many described a digital communications culture that sounded oppressive —  and that didn’t exist in the very recent past. I hesitate to draw any sweeping conclusions based on a few dozen undergrads in Claremont. But I am at least struck by how little the radically changed campus communications landscape is explored even as campus speech norms loom so large. Would you help me to remedy that? I have questions for people at all institutions of higher education, especially students at schools where lots of undergrads live on campus. Whether you answer one or all 10, or just share this with college students, I’d be grateful. Answers to any or all of those questions, or any other insights that seem related, are greatly appreciated —  email conor@theatlantic. com, and rest assured that I will withhold all names unless you explicitly tell me that you would prefer that yours be included.

55559,76504,The Nigerian Oil Company’s Missing Billions,Atlantic,,2016-03-18,2016.0,3.0,,", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) “failed to pay” about $16 billion in revenue owed to the state’s treasury, according to an audit. Samuel Ukura, the   issued a report Monday to the national assembly to disclose details about the missing funds. But the NNPC on Wednesday said in a statement the amount was closer to $1. 64 billion. It said the audit failed to account for maintenance fees, a subsidy on oil products, and losses from   theft. NNPC, which is   is obligated by law to transfer its oil revenues to the government, which then decides how much is returned to the company. But an audit of the 2014 figures found a shortfall of $16 billion. Although corruption at NNPC has been blamed for missing funds in the past, revenue loss does indeed begin at the pipes. Poor infrastructure has resulted in people siphoning crude oil from   rusted pipes into drums. These drums are then transported on boats to illicit refineries, from where oil is sold on the black market. “It’s impossible to estimate how much oil has been lost in this manner,” Kolawole Banwo, a senior program officer at Nigeria’s Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, told the BBC last year. “That’s because there is no independent metering facility to measure the quantity of oil that is extracted. ” Corruption in Nigeria’s oil industry, Africa’s largest, is an old problem, and its eradication is a   political goal —  one that has seen few results. Like previous presidential candidates, Muhammadu Buhari ran in last year’s election on an   platform. But Buhari, who is now president, has taken significant steps to crack down on corruption in Nigeria. In February, he fired 26 heads of   companies and federal agencies, and last October he appointed himself, amid criticism, head of the Oil Ministry. He split NNPC into two entities, and plans to further splinter the company to better monitor affairs. But the problems Buhari faces are entrenched. The funds from 2014 aren’t the only time NNPC has withheld payments. A previous audit revealed the company owed $1. 48 billion. That figure itself may be conservative. Lamido Sanusi, the former central bank governor, has alleged NNPC withheld $20 billion it owed to the state. He was fired after making this claim. Similar allegations of corruption —  and equally vast sums —  have been directed at various government agencies and officials. Tolu Ogunlesi, a Nigerian journalist, says he believes Buhari is different in this respect. In an article, he compared Buhari’s present administration with his rule between 1984 and 1985 when he was the country’s military leader. In that period, Buhari waged a “war on indiscipline,” to fight corruption, but that campaign was  . Buhari, who had seized power in a coup, was himself deposed by a putsch in 1985. Ogunlesi says: He is that rare Nigerian phenomenon: a military general with a single local bank account, no foreign accounts or homes, and no known business interests outside of two farms and modest company shareholding."
55701,76687,A Workplace-Diversity Dilemma ,Atlantic,,2016-04-07,2016.0,4.0,,", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Several of my female friends working in various industries have recently expressed a similar disheartening sentiment: “It’s not that I prefer male bosses, but they’re the only ones who give me opportunities and successfully fight for me. ” The first time I heard this, I was outraged, but soon I started to worry if this is a belief that actually undermines female leadership. It’s troubling in a couple of ways, but most of all, how can female managers succeed if those who report to them don’t trust their ability to navigate workplace power structures? Put more pointedly, what if talented employees prefer and benefit from male leadership because professional culture enables men to have an edge in getting things done? One of the common strategies for achieving greater gender and racial diversity in the workplace is to promote more women and people of color to leadership roles, in the hope that such people will promote diversity from within. In theory, women and minority leaders are likely to think about diversity more when making personnel decisions. They’re also thought to be better at identifying talented but overlooked job candidates and may push for workplace policies that could enable those women and people of color to thrive. Is this how things play it out in reality? David Hekman, an associate professor at the University of Colorado’s Leeds School of Business, studies the ways businesses manage their employees, and specifically keeps an eye on gender and racial biases at work. “It always baffled me that my nonwhite and female coworkers would put up with what I perceived to be blatant   comments in the workplace,” Hekman wrote to me in an email. “It also really surprised me when women would advocate to hire a male job candidate when I thought a female candidate was clearly more qualified   …     It struck me that maybe as a white man I was the only one who could advocate for   without suffering major   repercussions, even though doing so was outside my comfort zone. ” So Hekman, along with researchers from the National University of Singapore and the University of Texas, decided to look into these office dynamics. He led a study that surveyed 350 U. S. executives in 26 industries on what happens when women and nonwhite executives advocate for more diversity at their companies. To start, the researchers pored over the peer reports they collected from the colleagues of those executives. They identified a set of behaviors that they thought suggested a commitment to diversity —  understanding and respecting different cultures, valuing working with a diverse group, being comfortable managing people of diverse backgrounds —  and then looked for indications of them in the reviews. Then they looked at performance reviews from the bosses of those executives. They found that white women and nonwhite executives who, in the study’s framework, valued diversity were rated as being less competent and having lower performance. In contrast, white male executives who promoted diversity experienced slightly better ratings: This group was perceived as competent regardless of whether they had made an issue of diversity. In a second study, the researchers asked a group of people to rate hiring decisions. The same dynamic turned up yet again, as participants gave bad ratings to white women and nonwhite managers when they hired white women or people of color, whereas white male managers were not judged harshly for promoting diversity of hiring from their own group. So why is it that white women and people of color are punished for promoting diversity? Hekman says it has to do with social status. White men are a   group, and with that comes the freedom to make bold decisions without fear that they’ll be judged as incompetent. “For the most part, whatever white men do is viewed to be normal, legitimate, and expected,” says Hekman. “So if I as a white man advance diversity, people look at me weird, but they pretty much let me keep on doing it. Sure, I have to endure some teasing, but I don’t lose my social status. I can still talk and voice my opinion on a variety of issues without being stereotyped as incompetent or as someone who is weird or different or illegitimate. ” For anyone who’s not a white man, all of this, for lack of a better word, sucks. It also might explain why some of my friends might prefer white male bosses, because they’re the ones with the most agency. Women and nonwhite executives know there are professional repercussions for promoting other women or people of color, so a (natural) desire for   can keep their hands tied. “As demographically   individuals, women really are damned if they do help other women,” says Hekman. Stefanie Johnson, one of Hekman’s   on the paper and an assistant professor at the University of Colorado’s business school, recommends that companies should be ensuring that a large number of women and minorities are considered for hires and promotion. She thinks   training might help too. Johnson says that having a diversity policy is good, but concrete   actions are important because ultimately, when companies put the onus on their employees to fight for diversity, it might unfairly punish women and people of color. An unconventional policy recommendation, from the National Association of Women and Information Technology, is to put a white man in charge of a company’s diversity efforts, since that person won’t be punished. But there’s just one problem with that. When Hekman shared his research with his peers, they teased him. “Diversity is threatening to most white guys,” said Hekman. “For example, I shared the HBR article” —  he wrote an article about his research in Harvard Business Review —  “with my basketball buddies (who are all tall white men) and the only response I got was ‘Burn that bra, bro.’ Basically, they feel there’s a   competition between races and sexes and so they feel like I am betraying my own tribe. Maybe I am. ” “But,” he went on, “I think it’s the right thing to do, even though it will probably make me have to work harder to maintain my position in the long run. I’m convinced breaking up the old boys’ network is the best thing for society in the long run. ”"
56358,77518,Gary Johnson Is Having a Good Day,Atlantic,Nora Kelly,2016-05-24,2016.0,5.0,,"   I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. If Gary Johnson wants to make it onto a primetime   stage as the Libertarian Party’s nominee, he needs to qualify by polling above 15 percent. If he wants to be the nominee, he needs a strong showing at the party’s convention this weekend. And if he wants a strong showing at the convention, he needs to demonstrate to delegates that he’s their party’s ideal   —  a candidate who can be even a little competitive in a   matchup with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Johnson just got good news: A poll released Tuesday morning shows the candidate with 10 percent of the national vote. How Republican Governors Are Narrowing Clinton’s Choices, The Morning Consult survey puts Clinton at 38 percent, Trump at 35 percent, and Johnson, the   former New Mexico governor who also ran for president in 2012, trailing with 10 percent. For any other candidate, that low number would be a sign that the end is near. But not for Johnson, or other   candidates hoping to make it big in an election year when many voters will likely hold their noses as they cast their ballots. The   figure is close to a personal best for Johnson as a presidential candidate poll analysts note that it is roughly twice as high as Johnson’s figures from the last cycle. Simply being part of the poll represents a gain in Johnson’s quest for   legitimacy. When I talked to him earlier this month, he lamented that he is not often included in surveys. He claimed libertarians face a vicious cycle: Mainstream media does not frequently cover libertarians because they aren’t in polls, and pollsters don’t include the party’s candidates in surveys because they aren’t getting coverage. Libertarian leaders want their candidate on the debate stage alongside   candidates, similar to   nominees of the past like Ross Perot. But to qualify, a candidate needs at least 15 percent of the vote in five national polls chosen by the Commission on Presidential Debates. When I asked the campaign Tuesday how Johnson could bump up his percentage, his communications director, Joe Hunter, noted that the “first step” is getting into polls, “which is finally happening. ” More awareness and more interest around Johnson “will go a long way toward 15 percent,” Hunter said. But Tuesday’s results do not mean Johnson will absolutely get a spot on the stage. Those debate standards are difficult to meet. They will require Johnson to make big gains in multiple polls by the time of the first debate in September —  enough that the commission could be choosy about which surveys it uses and still let him in. He also needs to win his party’s nomination in a few days. Johnson, who   as socially liberal and fiscally conservative, is the presumptive nominee, but he’s got competitors. The former antivirus software mogul John McAfee and the former Fox News producer Austin Petersen are also considered   though the dearth of polling among libertarian voters makes it difficult to assess their standing. Tuesday’s poll isn’t the only one Johnson can point to as he makes his case to party delegates, who are uncommitted. He also came in at 10 percent in a Fox News survey released last week and 11 percent in a March Monmouth University survey. He also won 18 percent of Independents in both the Fox and Morning Consult surveys, the campaign pointed out. This dovetails with Johnson’s contention that his campaign is a home for voters who don’t fit in with the major parties. Johnson surely knows he cannot be too confident even if he wins the nomination, and even if he did give the party a record showing in 2012, winning 1 percent of the   vote. As with any poll, these three have a margin of error of several percentage points it’s unwise to parse the numbers too closely. And the political system heavily favors   candidates. Many voters don’t seem to realize or care that there are other options out there. But in this election, at least, some voters still haven’t made up their minds: Seventeen percent of those surveyed chose “Don’t Know” when asked to choose between Johnson, Clinton, and Trump."

‘I Voted for the Wrecking Ball’: Your Pushback
",Atlantic,Chris Bodenner,2016-11-13,2016.0,11.0,,"Readers across the bitter partisan divide in the U. S. discuss the results of the 2016 presidential election and what it means for the country. (The Atlantic’s overall stance on Donald Trump remains firm.) To join in, especially if you’re a Trump voter, please send us a note: hello@theatlantic. com. We’ve gotten a ton of reader response to the long detailed note from the Southern white guy with a master’s degree who voted for Trump because he wanted to bring a “wrecking ball” to Washington. This first reader, Pamela, scratches her head: I read the Southern reader’s note with great curiosity and found his sentiments very familiar and heartening —  until I realized that I still couldn’t comprehend where a vote for Trump, or a wrecking ball, or a middle finger, fit in. I reread it and had the same reaction. Towards the end, where he references “crazy is,” I was unable to follow him to Trump versus Clinton —  it just didn’t jive with their policies. So, I am left wondering what his vision of the future is and how Trump fits that. It sounds like he leads a pretty decent life in a pretty decent place. Room for improvement, sure, but a wrecking ball? I still don’t get it. This next reader is more forceful in his criticism of the Southern Trump voter: Ok, this has been an interesting reader series, but time to push back. I don’t think all Trump voters, or even most Trump voters, are “racist” in some white supremacist sense. But I do think they are missing a pretty fundamental point. Southern Guy’s description of life paints a picture of a pretty nice world in which people of all colors and creeds have opportunities. I agree. I am a Clinton voter. I stand for the pledge, I decorate the graves of my veteran grandfathers on Memorial Day, and I fly the flag on the Fourth of July. We have a great country that has problems to fix (many of which are really hard issues arising from globalization) but it has also made enormous progress.   So then the question is, why take the “wrecking ball” to it? If these folks could look at their own positions from another perspective, they might realize why people suspect that racism motivated their decisions in whole or in part. It is because the results of wrecking things are a lot worse for nonwhites, women, and LGBT folks than they are straight white guys like Southern Guy and me. I work with a Muslim guy with whom I travel out of the U. S. regularly. He’s an American citizen. The  ’s website said —  in a press release (not a random question) which was not changed even when it was called out —  that he would ban my colleague’s   into the U. S. [CB: Though this morning, Trump surrogate Giuliani backed away from the Muslim ban, telling CNN it’s no longer operative.] If you don’t think that would be possible or legal, read Korematsu [the Supreme Court decision allowing for   internment camps during WWII]. Did Trump mean all that? I don’t know. Would he get away with it? Probably not. But guess what? I don’t really have to worry about it I get to come home either way. My Muslim colleague does have to worry. That is my privilege.    Another reader, Alex, expands on that idea of privilege —  but not in the clichéd way that is bandied about too often, to diminish one’s accomplishments or end a discussion: I am a Clinton voter. I imagine that your Trump voter and I have many different viewpoints, beliefs, and life experiences, but I also believe we would find many areas of agreement. I appreciate and do very much relate with his fairly nuanced views. When faced with the choice of bigotry and authoritarianism, a major factor in making that decision is privilege. (Let’s remember that a large portion of Trump voters are actually college educated with higher incomes, not just poor rural whites who were left behind. [According to exit polling, 49 percent of college grads voted for Clinton, 45 percent for Trump —  and he won the white   vote, 49 percent to Clinton’s 45 percent.) Based on your reader’s note, he seems to be aware of these advantages and does touch on them —  but then moves on. And I don’t just mean the typical liberal attack of “white privilege. ” Your reader is correct that it is used too freely and is not always a fair critique. I am speaking of generic privilege. He is a     white male. Part of the majority. Raised by two good parents. He is privileged. I do not say this in a derogatory sense. I myself am privileged in much the same way (educated Cuban male in a   city, born and raised in Miami). Being privileged, we both have the luxury of making a protest vote with limited consequences —  in all honesty, a protest vote I might have entertained with different candidates on the ballot. But not everyone has that luxury. They are rightly worried of increased discrimination, hate, and distrust directed towards them by their fellow citizens and their government. This next reader, Lauren, describes some of the people who are worried about increased hatred and discrimination in the wake of Trump’s election. She addresses the Southern Guy directly: Thanks for flipping me the bird. Because while you may have thought you were flipping off some corrupt politicians, what you were really doing is flipping off people like me who were voting for the progress you deemed unworthy. I’m not going to call you a racist, bigot,   misogynistic, or an uneducated redneck. There’s nothing in your piece that indicates you appear to be any of those things. But did you consider why those who hold those views have been emboldened by and found comfort with your candidate? Did it give you pause that Trump’s campaign chair was the CEO of Breitbart, a home to the   that often stokes the same gender and racial anxieties that are the lifeblood of white nationalists? Did it give you pause when Trump praised Alex Jones, a man that has denied Sandy Hook even happened causing incalculable pain to the parents that lost children that some now want to deny ever existed? Before you set that wrecking ball in motion, did you consider that many might feel the consequences far more deeply and significantly than you will when the house comes crashing down? You’re not the girls and women who woke up in the morning to realize 100 years after a hard fought right to vote was finally achieved, a woman will still not lead the country we love despite being eminently qualified and securing a majority of the votes —  losing to a man who bragged about sexually assaulting women. [See the new piece from my colleague Uri, “Why It’s So Hard for a Woman to Become President of the United States. ”] In 2016, we still only have less than 20 percent representation in Congress, only 4 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs are women, and we still make [$0. 79 to $0. 95] on the dollar. It’s nice that you appreciate that abortion isn’t going away just because we elected a Republican, but a woman’s legal right to a safe and legal abortion may. This may be something you can intellectually appreciate, but it won’t be you seeking an unsafe procedure or experience the fear of consequences of breaking the law. You will not be the woman who desperately wants a child only to be told that child has genetic abnormalities, and that instead of having a safe and legal medical procedure, you will be forced to maintain the pregnancy until you miscarry, deliver a stillborn or deliver a baby only to see that child die in hours, days or weeks. You won’t be the woman who has to wonder if her medical choice for contraception is going to be overridden by her employer’s religious beliefs. You’re not the Dreamer who was brought here as a child who now fears deportation to a country you’ve never known. Crazy is thinking that those who live in the country undocumented are not already experiencing consequences. Crazy is refusing to recognize that they are continuously paying restitution either by not being protected by labor laws or paying into a Social Security scheme they will never benefit from. Crazy is thinking a wall on our Southern border is going to fix the problem of illegal immigration or terrorism —  or that anyone is arguing for open borders in the first place. You’re not the disabled child who woke up to realize that sometimes bullies win. Another reader, Fleur, looks to the environment: I am an independent and always listen to both sides. I agree with almost everything this man is saying and I appreciate the time it took him to say it so well. But it is not true “that coal  still makes sense. ” It does not make sense. I don’t know how scientists have failed to convince the American citizenry of the extraordinary danger we are in   …     but we have failed. I know about Big Oil etc, but too much of our citizenry does not see the danger and it is getting more horrific by the day. And as always, it is going to hurt the little guys worst of all. Barry worries about the economy: Obama was disappointing on many fronts, but largely the disappointing effects facing wrecking ball man were the product of Republican obstructionism and the Fox News Pravda, Tea Party News Network, whiners such as Wrecking Ball man, who expected the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression, the result of the exact economic politics we have just reelected into power, to magically resolve itself back to 1955 —  all while half the nation was already jamming up the works with the same outlandishly hypocritical “I am not a racist” nonsense applauding inaction. I would believe characters like your reader had they likewise tossed out the   Congress and Senate on its ear   …     but no, not so.   Jonathan takes a conservative approach to the kind of radical change that a Trump wrecking ball could bring to institutions and the status quo: First off, I wanted to applaud you on sanctioning and hosting the sorely needed discussion to find common ground between the Clinton and Trump, left and right camps. To my white, male, Christian friend with the wrecking ball, I want to first express what a shame it is that he feels he has to preface his perspective with a repeated insistence that he is not prejudiced, and that he actively eschews discrimination. In a pluralistic society such as ours, we owe one another the presumption that we are   and tolerant until it is demonstrated otherwise, not the reverse. I would agree with him that our political system and its attendant institutions have grown extraordinarily perverse, and that swift and decisive intervention is necessary. The trouble with adjusting, let alone overhauling, such a monolithic structure is that any such societal paradigm perpetuates itself by convincing its constituent members that there is no viable alternative. Failing that, it menaces extremely adverse consequences to anyone who tries to replace it, and does its utmost to ensure this is the case. We have every reason to believe that our system will make good on its threat to take us all with it. To be sure, that unsettling possibility alone is not reason enough to shrink from confronting a social system, but my question to the Southern reader is what gives you or anyone else the right to indulge your desire to tear the system down at the expense of all those who will suffer immensely in its wake? I don’t mean that to rhetorically imply the absence of a rationale for this, but I ask this sincerely. I’ll update with a response from the Southern reader if he’s game. Beverly anticipates his response: Yes, I know that this is what you shudder to hear: the cry of guilty white liberals who must apologize for their own good fortune. However, a person who has the privilege of turning down Yale also has more responsibility than others for not only knowing, but also facing and interpreting, the history of the country in which he lives. He must know, and admit, that people came from across the sea, and, by virtue of their imagined authority of nation, sovereign, and flag, had the privilege —  yes, privilege, for it was not their right —  of appropriating another people’s land for their own. The past is prologue. He must know, and admit, that fortunes which have been preserved to this very day, were acquired from the forced labors of enslaved people. The past is prologue. He must know the history of   and de jure policies which artificially limit, and continue to limit, the lived spaces, employment, and educational prospects of so many Americans. After all, he admits to “reading a few history books. ” I don’t know what he’s read, but perhaps he’d like for me to recommend a few more. Here’s one more response from the wave of email that’s come into hello@ from Amanda: I respect people’s reasons for voting Trump. I empathize with the concerns of many of them, and I thought the “Wrecking Ball” reader’s essay provided another view into people who made this decision. Then I got to these lines and had to respond: Here’s the recipe for success and comfort in modern America: Stay in school, do your best, stay away from drugs, don’t have kids until you are no longer a kid, don’t break the law. That’s not the recipe for success at all. Talk to people in my generation. I’m 32, at the older age of the millennials. I went to a great, nationally ranked liberal arts college. My friends and I, we followed all your rules, and we do not have comfort and success in modern America. My friends from school don’t own houses, most of us don’t have children, and we’re all struggling to manage paycheck to paycheck. We have master’s degrees, because employers didn’t think our bachelor’s were enough. We stayed in school and then some. I have a J. D. from an Ivy League law school. I make my public sector salary work —  and let’s note that I work in the public sector because it provides me with reasonable hours. My chronic illnesses prevent me being able to work those   law jobs everyone always talks about. We stayed in school. We did our best. We have to put medical expenses on credit cards. I just had to have a tooth pulled because I could not afford the $1300 crown and root canal. I have a hole in my mouth. We didn’t exactly stay away from drugs, but, well, we weren’t addicted to them either. We were lucky, in retrospect. We were privileged here. As for the law, I think the extent of our   is related to the casual drug use, but I haven’t surveyed everyone on this part. You don’t have to worry about the kids part we can’t afford them, and we’re doing everything we can to keep from having them. Your opposition to abortion presumes that the only people who need abortions are careless, are doing something wrong somehow. I respect your views, but I want to point out that, with that line, you evidenced how you don’t understand what is happening in our economy and country. It is not just people mooching off of welfare, downtrodden coal miners, and people like you —  who aren’t rich! But are incredibly privileged. People with this privilege often don’t recognize it and don’t want to recognize it. Your letter indicates your parents probably did well for themselves, enough for them to be comfortable and help you out to. As Americans, we need to be frank and admit that working hard and doing your best are not enough in most cases if you do not come from a   or better background. It’s not just   folks who are getting set back months, or years, by a   car or a medical expense. We did everything (almost) to the letter. So why aren’t we seeing the results? My parents could never afford to help me. I took out loans, I got scholarships, I did what I was “supposed” to do to get ahead. I am drowning in medical debt because of the health insurance situation in this country. I am doing the very best I can and it is not enough. And I know that Donald Trump does not give a shit about any of this and doesn’t want to help people like me. After all, it must be that we didn’t work hard enough! If only I’d worked as hard as Trump and his kids. That’s how reader Ray describes himself in the subject line of the note he sent to hello@. The question Ray closes with is the most compelling: Should you take a gamble with a volatile candidate or one who’s predictably corrupt? I grew up on the West Coast, raised by Indian immigrants, went to a liberal university, and voted liberally on most stances until this election. I am currently working on a   professional degree, so I am not uneducated. My vote for Trump is a protest vote —  a protest that Sanders couldn’t provide. I’m tired of our country being whored out to the highest bidder. I’m tired of people coming into this country illegally, taking away the justice due to those who have waited in line for years to get into this great country. I’m tired of politics as usual. I’m tired of   safe spaces, and the general retreat on being confronted with opposing views. I’m tired of the sense of entitlement present in many of my peers. I’m tired of pretending that the U. S. is   while seeing my friends sipping their mochas in LA, SF, and NYC, ignoring the plight of the “flyover” states. I’m tired of accepting that U. S. politics is an inevitable palace of corruption, with trim made of corporate donations, a carpet of immunity, and a chandelier of complacency. I’m tired of accepting politics as the broken system we see today. As of very recently, I’m tired of   individuals grouping Trump supporters as ignorant, racist,   sexist. I was one of those people casting the judgement before the campaigns began. However, after having changed my opinion —  contrary to late night shows and other   political comedy —  now I’m just uninformed and racist. When I was trying to spread the Wikileaks revelations about the corruption of Clinton, I was wearing a tinfoil hat and was “unrealistic” about the nature of politics. The cognitive dissonance of former Sanders supporters was so strong it just about knocked me off my chair. The media response to Trump firmly solidified my position with Trump. The New York Times, The Atlantic, The New Yorker, and The Washington Post —  all my beloved bastions of journalism —  began a coordinated effort to turn their outlets into the the daily Trump takedown. They firmly stepped into the bubble of  : It is not possible for contradictory views of the 2016 election to exist without being racist or ignorant. Instead, they continued to perpetuate identity politics and wedge issues. Trump supporters couldn’t have legitimate views worthy of discussion, right? They obviously had to be bigots. If you feel that 50 million of your countrymen are racists and ignorant voters, I feel sorry for you. I implore those people to come on down from their towering high horse and talk to the simpletons, racists, and bigots outside of their society. Maybe when they’re trying to tell those simpletons how misguided they are, about how Kansas isn’t acting in its own best interest, the   society can take a moment to fairly consider the simpleton’s argument for but just a moment. That is, before they retreat to a place of intellectual and moral superiority —  again, telling Kansas what’s the matter with it. A political cartoon I saw last week captured my sentiment about the two major candidates in 2016. I view Clinton and Trump as a game of Russian roulette, with each candidate being a different revolver. Clinton’s is fully loaded with corruption, propaganda, and bad decisions as a leader. Trump’s is only half loaded. Which one should Lady Liberty spin and point at her head? This next reader, Nana, also had major qualms with both candidates but comes down on Trump the hardest: I am a cross between your reader Marco [“The Smell of Corruption Emanating From the Clinton Machine”] and your Southern reader [“I Voted for the Middle Finger, the Wrecking Ball”] and, except for a few differences here and there, I could have written the latter’s piece. I am an immigrant from Africa with a PhD in engineering. I have lived in Texas, the Midwest, and now live in a red state in the Southwest. I love this country and, no matter how one voted, I think it is important that we all accept Trump as our   and pray for his success. But I don’t think the primary issue that concerns people who did not vote for Trump is the usual divide between Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and liberals, Red and Blue that often shape our political discourse, although that is what this discussion seems to be devolving into. Like Marco, I abhor the corruption of our politicians and feel a bit queasy about dynastic politics, but I also recognize that dynastic successions are not that uncommon in other areas such sports, media, business, and religious institutions —  and they need not be corrupting. I could quibble with Marco on the extent to which “the smell of” Clinton’s political corruption is somehow worse than Trump’s   corruption in his business life. But I wouldn’t have a problem with Marco deciding to vote for Trump on the basis of those two issues, if those were all we have to consider in selecting a President. Similarly, I share your Southern reader’s frustrations about our inability to secure our borders, or have sensible immigration or health care policies. I understand his desire to vote for “the wrecking ball” to give us a kick. By most accounts, Trump’s victory is largely due to Americans with similar frustrations voting for him. I suspect Romney, John Kasich, the Bushes, and the Republicans that came out forcefully against Trump share much of the concerns of Marco, your Southern reader, and most Americans. Our elections are mostly about our preferences for addressing such concerns. The constant refrain from these Trump voters here is that people are judging them as uneducated, bigoted, xenophobes, or misogynists just because they voted for Trump. If this is happening, it is clearly wrong and we should all push back forcefully against that narrative. But I don’t think that is the issue here. The shock of those who did not vote for Trump, including Romney, Kasich and several Republicans, is about something entirely different, I suspect. People waste no time pointing to Obama’s single comment about some “bitterly clinging to their guns and religion” as ample evidence of his identity politicking or bigotry. Many were aghast at Clinton’s truly deplorable comment describing some of Trump supporters as irredeemable “deplorables. ” And who can forget Romney’s “47 percent” comment that likely contributed to his loss in 2012. Each comment, while deplorable, was made by a politician in an unguarded moment. That doesn’t excuse it. But you know what? Each of them apologized profusely and paid a price. More importantly, not one of them repeated or stood by those comments for the rest of their campaigns. If Trump had made a couple of such unfortunate comments, apologized, and moved on, I would hope we would too. But in Trump’s case something quite different happened. Right from day one, he seemed to have chosen purposefully to use xenophobia and bigotry as tools to sow division. Not only did he repeatedly do this, but based on the evidence we have all seen and heard, I feel comfortable describing Trump as a xenophobe, bigot, and misogynist. Unfathomably, Trump’s campaign seemed to condone support from   even though he has Jewish family members. If he is none of these things as some say, but chose to play a part to win this election, that is even more despicable. Again, it is preposterous to suggest that all Trump voters share these characteristics. However, a not insignificant segment of Trump supporters, by their words, deeds, clothing at campaign rallies, and associations with hate groups, do seem to share some of these characteristics with Trump. It is one thing to vote for a populist or even volatile candidate who rails at the usual suspects of corrupt politicians, out of touch elites, the media, big business, unions, opposing parties and the typical broad groups both sides attack in elections. What is different here is that clearly   and decent voters, some of whom voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012, voted for a candidate that explicitly used bigotry, xenophobia, and misogyny as campaign tools to sow division. Even if you want to blow up the system, you don’t throw your fellow Americans under the bus. That is what is disturbing. Update from Nana: I don’t know if it matters at this point, but here is a point of clarification. Reading my email, I can see how you might think this, but I really do not have any major qualms with Clinton. Moreover, the issues I think need addressing —  border security, immigration, health care —  are universal. Clinton voters also want to see those issues addressed but in a different way. My point to all of us —  and to push back a little at both Lindsey and Robert today —  who from either side seem to be resorting back to the usual “let’s blame the ‘media,’” this election was really about us and our values, regardless of what the “media” did or did not do. There is a larger point to be made to these Trump voters who bristle at being tagged with Trump’s sins of bigotry, xenophobia, and misogyny, and I agree they really shouldn’t be tagged with them. But, if you will notice, none ever say Trump himself is not guilty of those sins. Minus Trump’s bigotry, misogyny, and xenophobia and the willingness to use them in the election, I wouldn’t begrudge any voter for picking him, although I personally wouldn’t for a variety of other reasons. But the choices would not have been that different from your usual suspects. What I think is staring us right in the face but we seem unwilling to confront is the following: Now that he is president, we must move forward and determine how best to live with our collective decision. But picking the Trump we know with his bigotry, misogyny, and xenophobia, smacks of those voters saying, “I don’t commit those sins myself and abhor them, but I will condone them from Trump, wielded in my name against a large segment of my fellow citizens, because I like the benefits we saw from his campaign (e. g. Lindsey) and believe he can solve America’s problems for all our benefits (e. g. Marco and your Southern reader). ” Maybe it’s because of my immigrant perspective, but who wants benefits acquired by those means? What sins in our name will we be willing to accept next month, next year, or during the next election? So far we’ve heard from two Trump voters in great detail: Alan, who’s most animated by identity politics, and our Southern reader who wants to take a “wrecking ball” to Washington. But both readers also had major qualms with the Trump candidacy. Another reluctant Trump voter, Marco, describes his deep aversion to establishmentarianism and dynastic politics —  and doesn’t spare the Republicans one bit: We shouldn’t be asking what happened with Trump. What happened to The Atlantic? I’ve been a reader for years, after abandoning Time and Newsweek because of their   superficiality. The appearance of considered thoughts at The Atlantic is what kept me there. But since you decided to take sides in the presidential election, strident hysterical writing is all I find, especially on November 9. That’s perhaps understandable The Day After, but, folks, the sky won’t fall. It won’t fall because the U. S. government’s institutions are designed to prevent irrational outcomes to a good degree. Trust the system a little, if you learned anything from history. I probably do not feel the pain to the same degree as you do, though I am concerned, and on pins and needles. I admit it: I voted for Trump —  at the limit of my tolerance for bad taste and unhinged statements. But I did so not because I am an undereducated, violent, intolerant,   xenophobe —  as the press has made habit of defining Trump supporters. I have an MBA. I refuse violence and support gun control. And I’m an immigrant, now a citizen after obtaining green cards twice, all by the legal process. I voted for Trump only because of the smell of corruption emanating from the Clinton Machine. That smell is well documented by Wikileaks and Podesta’s emails depicting the Clinton Foundation   State Department connections. To that you can add the past four decades of continuous scandals —  why only them with so many? You get my picture. But there is one more reason to fear their corruption: the history of ALL countries around the world, since WWII, where an immediate relative followed a president or PM (see my list below). In all cases, either the “succession” was made possible by endemic corruption, or advanced it as a result, or both. This is to be expected when the vested interests supporting one person get to take advantage of continued control of the government from behind the scenes by electing the relative. By the way, the Bushes fit that pattern too. I objected to Jeb Bush on those grounds. Democratic institutions can control visible political activity (and will control Trump’s extremes) but they cannot control the invisible quid pro quo that corruption brings. Trump’s lack of institutional backers is the attractive part. If he can just push and deliver term limits and limits on lobbying, as he promised, he will have drained enough of the swamp. Beyond that the Congress can handcuff him as necessary. So, perhaps the sky is not falling and a more reasoned discussion could help your readers, and recover the high editorial standards of The Atlantic. More importantly, you could help voters understand that women can and do make great leaders (Thatcher, Meir, Merkel) but we have to pick those that built their own career on their own ability, not those pushed along by private interests. Let’s hope for a better choice next time. Here’s the list of dynastic world leaders that Marco compiled (I added # ): Did the Democratic Party make a mistake backing another Clinton? Can you relate to reader Marco’s sentiments? If so, does it matter when it comes to backing Trump? Drop us a note if you’d like to respond to Marco. Update from another reader, Rick: “This is the first   argument that doesn’t scare me to death. ” Then let reader Mark try: I would like to point out the obvious: The Clinton dynasty is likely over whenever Hillary is done. The Bush dynasty still has some legs. But the Trump dynasty is just beginning. He gave his children large roles in his campaign and will either give them roles in his administration or will have them overseeing his business. To put it ungenerously, we now have our own Uday and Qusay. A Trump voter describes his worldview in great detail, and despite his blunt quote above, his note is more nuanced and perhaps more relatable than you think: I am Southern. I am white. I am a male. I was raised Roman Catholic and now go to a Methodist church regularly with my wife and kids. I value the 2nd Amendment but do not own a gun. Every male in my family, save me, is currently serving or has served in the U. S. military. I stand at the pledge of allegiance, and stand and sing with the anthem. I live near streets named after Stonewall Jackson and Strom Thurmond and know Tillman Hall was named after a racist populist who carried a pitchfork. Until recently, I attended field trips with my kids to our state capitol where the Confederate flag still flew, and I am genuinely glad we finally took it down. I have a Masters degree. My kids go to public school with kids of all races, colors, and creeds. Our neighborhood has immigrant families,   families, minorities, and   couples. Our sports teams are   diverse, and play beautifully together, on and off the field. I have neither the time, energy, or room in my heart for hatred, bigotry, or racism. I work hard and sacrifice for my family. I expect everyone to do the same and believe most do. I am romantic enough to still believe that America was created and intended to be a meritocracy. I am intelligent enough to understand the realty that not every one starts off in life from the same spot and not all of us will reach the attain the same levels of success —  however you define it. I also know that living right now, right here, is the greatest advantage any man, women, or child in the history of humankind has ever had. I understand a ruling class exists in our country and contrary to what many believe, my white skin does not provide me access to it. I started off with advantages others didn’t —  many of which were afforded me by my parents sacrifices, judgment, and toil. They stayed away from drugs. The waited until marriage to have children. They moved to chase a better life, took night classes at local community colleges to earn credentials. They passed on new cars for used ones, sewed to repair clothes, declined cable television, ate in, not out —  and saved every day and every night. They taught me right from wrong, first impressions matter, there is no substitute for hard work and no limits on achievement. I love working people who answer the alarm clock. I love parents who make sure their kids will have it better than they do. I respect people too busy paying the light bill to keep up with “the news. ” I do not hate on the basis of race, sexual orientation, gender, or faith in any way shape or form. I like liberals, conservatives, and independents. I do not hate Obama or Hillary I do not know them. I did not deny Clinton my vote because she lacks a penis. I appreciate the incredible difficulties that surround an unwanted pregnancy, marvel at foster parents and adoption, but detest even the thought of abortion. But I have read a history book or two, so I get the lessons of prohibition.  I know we can’t just “turn the switch off” on abortion and I know a red herring when I see one. Abortion isn’t going away because we elected a Republican. It just isn’t.        I know the Clintons do not really care about me. I know Trump could not care less. I know Morning Joe will look the same tomorrow and the day after, and Fox News will put even more colorful graphics and pretty anchors on next week. I know Rush is a buffoon, and Al Sharpton is too. I know some schools are better than others, some students are too, and not everyone is destined to Jay Z or Jordan or Bill Gates. I know life has meaning beyond $ and I can be happy with what I have —  and most importantly, ok with what I don’t. I can dream big and one day maybe design a better duck call that gets me my own TV show or make a loom for kids to make rubber band bracelets that makes me a fortune. America fosters those dreams. I voted for the wrecking ball —  and I feel better about it now than I did in the booth.   I love New York —  Gotham, the capital of the world. I watch George Clooney movies and download Kanye —  not because I care about their politics but because O Brother Where Art Thou is funny and “Gold Digger” is a good song. I love visiting Seattle and Chicago, Atlanta and Vegas. I tip well. I am courteous to the airline attendant, the hotel concierge, the blackjack dealer, and the roofer fixing my leaky roof. I try to pay the bills, save a little for college, retirement, the emergency fund. I try to eat better, work out a little, read   watch Frontline, listen to NPR, learn something new every day. I respect, appreciate, and marvel at the success of others of any and every race, religion, and gender. I check out Mother Jones, the Daily Kos, and the Drudge Report. I know my brother in the U. S. Army will die tomorrow so a millionaire quarterback can kneel during the Anthem while my oldest brother, the police officer, will kick in the door of a trailer to get a white kid, an African American kid, an undocumented immigrant kid, out of harm’s way. This isn’t about hate it just isn’t. I know what the Fed is and who created it. I know the Treasury will be led by another JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs suit with an Ivy League degree and a painting hanging on the wall in the Hamptons worth more than I will ever see or know. I know lobbyists will still lobby, and tax money will still fund bridges to nowhere. I know people who know important people will be let in on deals and corruption on both sides isn’t going away any time soon. I know the world isn’t perfect. I know American democracy is far from perfect. I also know it’s the best form of government on Earth —  electoral college and all.   I know a   kid born in obscurity in Hawaii to an American mother and a Kenyan father can grow up to be president and I want to live here, where that can happen. I know our representatives used to be the local banker, insurance agent, hardware store owner, and they used to serve at the expense of their business and then hand off the duty to the next citizen in line. I know we cannot go back to that way of life, that speed of life, that small of a world.   I am for progress, but what I deem the right kind of progress. That’s my right and I exercise it at the ballot box. I am against career politicians owning condos in the Dominican Republic. I am for clean air and water. I am against throwing jobs away in West Virginia when coal still makes sense. I am for Muslims living openly and worshipping as they please. I do not care who you choose to marry or divorce or date or whatever. I will not apologize for the Christmas pageant at the public school or a Christian prayer before kickoff. I am for Israel existing I am for Palestine existing. Peacefully. I am for a safety net for people when they fall on hard times. I am not for government handouts as a way of life. I want everyone —  of all kinds —  pulling on the same side of the damn rope. Pitch in, make this a better place for everybody that obeys the law, pull yourself up by your bootstraps everyday and do some form of honest work. Come here legally, adopt our way of life, learn our language and preserve yours, respect our legal and social traditions and observe yours freely, engage in deliberative thought and debate without risk of being labelled a bigot or a hater because you disagree. I am tired of the machine rolling over us —  all of us.  The Clinton machine, the Republican machine, the big media, investment banking, hedge fund carrying interest, corporatist, lobbying, influence peddling, getting elected and immediately begin fundraising for the next election machine —  they can all kiss my ass. Maybe Trump won’t do a thing to change or fix any of it. Hillary definitely would not have changed any of it. So I voted for the monkey wrench —  the middle finger —  the wrecking ball.   I do not have the time, energy, or opportunity to march through downtown and chant vulgarities or spray paint buildings or set cop cars on fire. So I protest —  and use my voice —  with a ballot. Go ahead: Label me a racist, a bigot, a   misogynistic, an uneducated redneck. But I turned down Yale, motherfuckers I ain’t who you think I am. And while I love grits and pulled pork barbecue and collard greens and cold beer in a bottle, I also love my neighbors of all colors, especially if they can cook. I want a synagogue, a church, and a mosque on Main St. all in a row, getting along and following the golden rule. And we mostly do.   But I have grown tired. I admit, I am tired of arguing with crazy. Crazy is thinking we do not have to secure our borders when people want to kill us because we don’t stone homosexuals or because we let women drive. Crazy is thinking you can live in this country below the radar, illegally, enjoy all we have inherited and worked to grow and preserve, and not make some form of restitution to others that follow the law. Crazy is believing you can get health care for free, cell phones for free, have kids without consequences, drop out of school, join a gang, get a neck tattoo —  and not face consequences. Crazy is treating the same symptoms and never the disease. Here’s the recipe for success and comfort in modern America: Stay in school, do your best, stay away from drugs, don’t have kids until you are no longer a kid, don’t break the law. You might be a   or a welder, a truck driver or a rapper. You might sell insurance, teach school, sell homes, or pave roads. You might become a chef or a mechanic, work with computers or take care of people in a nursing home. You will be able to afford Netflix, have food on the table, pay the rent or own a home, buy a car that runs, not get shot by the police, and probably find some happiness. Nobody will hate you because you’re a girl, or a person of color, or gay or straight, or speak with an accent. We just won’t. We will invite you to the block party, watch our kids swim together at the neighborhood pool, go to work together, study at school together, pray together or not, cheer for the Raiders together, play golf together, argue about politics —  together.   Update: Many readers respond here. So far we have heard from readers —  here and here —  who empathize with the grievances of Trump voters but who couldn’t support the demagogue themselves. Now let’s here from a Trump voter, Alan. He was a very reluctant to back the “deplorable” man but ultimately did so because of the following reasons, detailed below: the “bigot” stigma is tossed around too freely by leftist whites too many liberal commentators are too smug he fears that cisgender men will exploit   bathrooms and, perhaps most of all, he’s outraged and worried about the new campus PC. Here’s Alan (the bracketed notes are mine): Ben is the first writer to, in my opinion, hit the nail on the head. I started out as a Never Trumper and actually still deplore the man. But on Tuesday I voted for him. My wife is   my children ½ white ½ Hispanic. I have nieces who are ½  . I hate bigotry and take it very, very, seriously. So when I hear Charlie Rangel say “bigots no longer use racial slurs they talk about balanced budgets and the line item veto,” it infuriates me. [CB: I couldn’t find a quote similar to that, but Rangel is known for his divisive rhetoric. Update: Alan points to this alleged quote from Rangel from 1994 that he said he paraphrased, but I wouldn’t trust the source, since the alleged quote isn’t really found elsewhere.] Accusations of racism are being thrown about as political weapons (mostly by white liberals) in a way that belittles the seriousness of bigotry. I don’t like the economic policies of Barack Obama, but if I disagree with him and anyone on the left hears me I will immediately be branded a bigot. I also believe that at a time when the economy is soft with    job growth [latest jobs report here] it’s a bad time to have high immigration it drives down wages for all Americans: White, Black, Asian, or Hispanic. My wife’s hometown of El Paso is a perfect example, with high unemployment [higher than Texas but lower than the U. S.] and low wages. I don’t think Obama cares his aim is to change the electorate in a way that favors Democrats and the resulting inevitable ethnic tension plays right into his hands. [CB: Sorry to interject here, but Obama has a longstanding and consistent aversion to identity politics —  something we’ll explore in a future note.] We like to believe the electorate chooses our leaders, but today our leaders are choosing the electorate. It’s   no matter the skin color of those involved. Next, I have an advanced degree and own my own business. I have a very “live and let live” attitude about gay marriage and routinely prepare tax returns for gay couples. But I’m a Catholic and a Texan, so I’m accustomed to being disparaged on the news each night by commenters on the left referring to people like me, who they don’t even know, as hicks, yahoos, and haters (by Chris Matthews, Paul Krugman, Tom Friedman, Bill Maher, Joy Behar). I deplore the thought that men should be allowed in women’s restrooms —  not because I have any problem with those who are biologically male but identify as female (I suspect this relatively small group to be mostly comprised of gentle souls) but I have two young daughters, and I’m terrified of the much larger group of fully heterosexual,   young men (of whom I was a member, around the age of 14) that will be the first into the women’s restroom peeking through the doors on the stalls. But no one, and I mean no one, on the left will even brook a discussion on the topic [Notes discussion here]. How about an accommodation where more   restrooms are utilized? “No, this must be forced upon the haters no matter what. ” Finally, I’m convinced the social justice movement on campuses is the primary driver of the Trump victory. My   daughter constantly hears talk of white privilege and racial identity, of separate dorms for separate races (somewhere in heaven Martin Luther King Jr is hanging his head and crying). She also hears how it’s a microaggression to speak of the U. S. as a melting pot (as a   American, imagine how this makes her feel). I hate identity politics, and I fear for the future of my daughters as a result. When everything is about identity politics, is the left really surprised that on Tuesday millions of white Americans, for the first time ever, voted as “white”? If you want identity politics, identity politics is what you will get. I know many on the left will read this and ask how I could therefore possibly vote for Trump. The answer is that the right didn’t create it the left did. It constitutes the entire word view of the left today. The right is reacting. Maybe now that you see what you have created, you will turn back to promoting a vision of the world where race, gender, sexual orientation, and ethnicity fade away and we all become individuals again. Or maybe I’m just so sick of being called a bigot that my anger at the authoritarian left has pushed me to support this seriously flawed man. What do you think of Alan’s argument? Drop us a note and we’ll continue the debate. Update from Kevin, who thinks Alan “misses the forest for the trees”: “Identity politics” (and   political correctness) makes an easy target for people who are either in, or sympathize with, a ruling majority. Fox News figured that out long ago, and they’ve made bank on it —  War on Christmas, anyone? Against Alan’s point, though, I would argue that identity politics is simply a newer name (and partial aspect) for what we used to call the class struggle: of those who have been historically disadvantaged against those who have unfairly benefitted. Perhaps even many of those who now organize primarily as women,   or Latinos don’t fully realize that their efforts represent the only way the majority has allowed, even partially, a conversation about unfairness that should actually be subsumed under its largest category: the topic of reparations. Here are some statistics from a Forbes (!) article on the gap between minority and majority wealth: The typical black household now has just 6% of the wealth of the typical white household the typical Latino household has just 8% according to a recent study called The Racial Wealth Gap: Why Policy Matters, by Demos, a public policy organization promoting democracy and equality, and the Institute on Assets and Social Policy. In absolute terms, the median white household had $111, 146 in wealth holdings in 2011, compared to $7, 113 for the median black household and $8, 348 for the median Latino household. (All figures come from the U. S. Census Bureau Survey of Income and Program Participation.) This is what is called the racial wealth gap. Even the New Deal and G. I. Bill programs, which led to the housing wealth that forms the majority of whites’ advantage in savings, deliberately and systematically excluded minorities, as   Coates has explained at length in The Atlantic. And of course, Native Americans were the original victims of majority expropriation, while women have been deprived by a parallel type of discrimination that expressed itself mainly through social norms about family structure.   Would Alan prefer an honest conversation about how genocide, slavery, Jim Crow, patriarchal family structures, and New Deal and G. I. Bill discrimination led to the incredible wealth gaps between whites and minorities and women that still persist through multiple generations? Followed by an honest conversation about how the majority can best repair the effects of the unfair advantage it was given —  and still gets? Those are the conversations that have a chance to get to the heart of the matter, and I would hope he would want to be part of them. If we make progress on such larger questions, I can promise him that the identity politics will subside to a matter of festive   coloration, like today’s Polka Festivals and St. Patrick’s Day parades, within a just and multicultural society at peace with itself. Update: Alan has a very thorough rebuttal, and I keep my interjections (via brackets) to a bare minimum this time: Soft Job Market: You picked a single monthly jobs report to contradict my point,  you failed to mention that it takes 145, 000 jobs per month just to keep up with new workers entering the workforce. The unemployment rate is less important, in my view  the view of many others, than the workforce participation rate, which is way down since 2007. Half of this number is from baby boomers retiring, but half of it isn’t. El Paso: You alluded to unemployment in El Paso, which, as I stated, is not (in my view  the view of many others) the best measure. You ignored my comment about low wages in El Paso. The poverty rate there is 20. 1% compared to 17. 5% in all of Texas and 14. 5% nationally. It’s much the same along the entire Texas border. Obama  Identity Politics: In my comments where you interjected your defense of Obama, I had said nothing about identity politics —  that came later. I said he was manipulating border security to increase Democratic voters. Then he refers to those who disagree as bigots (ok, so it does have to do with identity politics). It’s certainly true that Obama typically stays above the fray concerning identity politics, but he certainly doesn’t keep his surrogates from pursuing it. Remember the ridiculous War on Women? [Yep, and I lampooned that terminology at the time.] But then at times, Obama participates himself. Remember his comments regarding poor whites “bitterly clinging to their guns  religion”? Remember his 2010 comments on Univision where he said: “If Latinos sit out the election instead of saying, ‘We’re gonna punish our enemies, and we’re gonna reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us  …    . ”? Remember how, after the floods in Louisiana, it took him a week to visit, pausing his golf vacation at Martha’s Vineyard just long enough to send an advisory to the state to not discriminate against minorities during the cleanup? The media ignored it, no help came, so the “Cajun Navy” took over: [CB: I really wish I could post the handful of photos that Alan attached, but we don’t have the copyright. The four moving photos show white folks helping black folks, and vice versa.] Even your own publication thinks political identity is a problem for the left. Transgender Rights: So you linked to one article [it’s actually an   discussion thread] in your publication about transgender rights. That’s good. But just try that on a college campus, or some workplaces: https:  . ncronline.             https:  . aclu.     ”https:  . archive.   ”>The Fallacy of ‘White Privilege. ’” Money quote: [T]here are a host of privileges that dwarf “white privilege. ” A huge one is   Privilege. If you are raised by a father and mother, you enter adulthood with more privileges than anyone else in American society, irrespective of race, ethnicity, or sex. That’s why the poverty rate among   black families is only 7 percent. Compare that with a 22 percent poverty rate among whites in   homes. Obviously the   home is the decisive “privilege. ” Back to Alan: Summary: So I’m through with “Trumpsplaining. ” The events of the last few days,  the response of the media, have convinced me that the left has simply  . So be it. They’re building a path to   2020. But here’s an event that occurred locally in the last couple of days that I’d like you  Kevin to discuss: Victoria Smith, the daughter of one of the Dallas police officers killed during the July 7 ambush was told she was no longer invited to hit an honorary serve at a volleyball game at Southern Methodist University. In a Facebook post where the   from SMU is reproduced, the college says: ”In light of recent events and diversity within the SMU community, the demonstration could be deemed insensitive”   …     the recent events apparently being the election. SMU is now backpedaling as fast as it can since the news broke. *** Here’s a note (emailed and posted before the updates from Kevin and Alan) from reader D. A. on the perilously close distance between white identity politics and white supremacy: This question may become the biggest one in America politics,  : Is it possible to have a “white identity” politics that is not inherently a politics of white supremacy? The best hypothetical I can think of is this: Suppose you are studying a proposed piece of legislation. First you ask yourself: How will this impact people? Then: How will this impact white people? Now reverse the order in which you ask the questions.  Now substitute any other political identity group for “white. ” Is there a difference between a white person asking: “How will this impact people like me?” vs. “How will this impact white people?” Can we find the line (if it even exists) between white identity politics and white supremacy somewhere in that hypothetical? I haven’t yet. So “white identity vs. white supremacy” will likely be the big American political question of the next decade (unless economic status becomes a more important marker of identity than race). One more Update, if you’re still reading at this point. Molly writes: You didn’t even allow a   to express himself without interjecting your [facts] and your comment about [seeing the latest jobs reports] indicates that you either don’t understand or are not willing to understand the decades of devastation resulting from structural unemployment. Did you read the jobs report, or stop after the first page? Check out the establishment data on page 5. Do note the winners and losers. Since I’m already here on a high horse, I’d love to share my perspective. The best word to describe my feelings is ambivalent, torn between people I love who voted for Trump and people I love who voted for Clinton. Unfortunately, that ambivalence and   need to play devil’s advocate have already made me feel unwelcome by both sides. Currently, my glass case of emotions include: We got ourselves into this situation together. The only way we get ourselves out   …     is together. As brilliant and scathing as Alec Baldwin was with his portrayal of Donald Trump this year, SNL’s “Black Jeopardy” sketch was ultimately the real standout —  for its humor and its humanity: At the onset of our dialogue with Clinton votes and Trump votes —  or at least voters who understand where some Trump voters are coming from —  reader Ben diagnosed what he sees as a shortcoming of the left right now: an   to stigmatize people as bigots for what may just be misplaced or simply misunderstood views, rather than active hatred. (One of the examples Ben cited was the successful effort to get Brendan Eich fired as CEO of Mozilla because he donated to the admittedly awful Prop 8, which banned   marriage in California for a time.) This reader agrees with Ben: He has diagnosed a significant reason people voted for Mr. Trump. I’m a conservative who did not end up voting for him, but like Ben, I thought about it a lot. The left has adopted bully tactics through their control of the media and the universities. Rather than deal with the right’s arguments, they use creative  : racist, xenophobic, homophobic, hicks. I can tell you for a fact, neither myself nor any of my conservative friends and family are any of those things, and yet we’re called that frequently. What in the world? Mrs. Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment and Mr. Podesta’s   that threw Catholics and Evangelicals under the bus are perfect examples of this moral snobbishness. The problem is, we won’t change our minds because you force us to celebrate homosexual unions or call us names in front of the entire nation. If you on the left want to change our minds, you need to understand us, and vice versa. Our country will keep splitting, the less we listen respectfully to each other. People are angry. Unfortunately, the only Republican candidate who showed anger to match was Mr. Trump. And unfortunately that anger morphed into a lot of ugly rhetoric and demagogic stances. Was that inevitable, or could such anger be channeled into something more constructive? Hopefully the actual mantle of responsibility in office will temper Trump —  though a compromising Trump could actually inflame Trumpism, because his supporters will witness how even Trump won’t be able to enact extreme measures like building a wall across Mexico and deporting 11 million illegal immigrants. Circling back to Ben’s argument, this next reader has a line that popped out in particular: “We cannot fight systemic issues by punishing individuals. ” His closing line is also strong, and his overall argument is really nuanced: My name is Dan, and I’ve been following your coverage of the campaign closely this year, especially the Trump Time Capsule series. I greatly appreciate the discussion The Atlantic has been hosting through reader emails and the insights they have produced. Your recent emails from Ben and Adam —  about the backlash against the left’s “bullying” contrasted with the historic and continuing oppression and marginalization of minority groups —  struck a chord. I’ve heard many angry people lamenting that Trump was elected because straight white people could not bear the loss of their privilege. It wasn’t until I read Ben’s email that I realized that the bullying coming from the left is exactly what the erosion of straight white male privilege looks like. We might define privilege as “not having to face injustice because you are treated as an embodiment of your group rather than an individual” (an inelegant definition for what is perhaps an inelegant term). In these instances of public shaming, people whose behavior would previously have been ignored due to their social privilege are instead faced with an unjust reaction because they are treated as the embodiment of straight, white, or male oppression. While these injustices are relatively few compared to the everyday injustices faced by marginalized groups —  for every person who lost their job [because of real or perceived bigotry] how many were never given a chance to be hired? —  they are legitimately unjust. And they must be addressed as a consequence of minority groups gaining social power and the erosion of majority privilege. We cannot fight systemic issues by punishing individuals. I believe we should publicize these cases as concrete examples of systemic problems, but hounding people out of their jobs is unjust and unproductive. Still, this is an issue that can either be addressed with discussion and debate within our newly developing social dynamics, or the privileged can fight back against it by   white supremacy within our society. With the election of Trump, white America has chosen to do the latter because even this small taste of the injustice you might face when you lack privilege has proved far more important to them than equality, justice, and acceptance for their fellow citizens. Or in other words, two wrongs don’t make a right, even if one of those wrongs —  outright bigotry —  is much worse than the other —  an   to label someone a bigot. And the latter is counterproductive to fighting the former. A pastor also responds to Ben’s note: I’m a   Democrat who has been in ministry in deep red parts of Texas for 15 years. Each of the four churches I’ve served has been heavily conservative and heavily Republican. Meanwhile, I have pretty much been in the closet with my political beliefs. There was the year that it was rather obvious, though: I was the only Democratic voter in a primary election. The Republican judges had to go to the back to get the Democratic judges so I could vote. And, my church was the precinct voting place, “Hey, George! Get up here! The pastor needs to vote!” Ben makes an interesting observation, but a large part of the Trump vote simply is from Republicans who assign various reasons for their leanings against Democrats: arrogant, judgmental liberals lying liberals crooked Hillary government “handouts” (except for the ones they receive, of course) baby killing big spending and others. However, all of these are subsumed under the simple fact that a poor Republican candidate beat a weak Democratic candidate. This next reader also has a simple reason for Trump’s success: I was not a Trump supporter, but I voted for him on Tuesday. I’m a big city refugee —  Manhattan, Chicago, and Houston —  now happily living in the rolling hills of rural NE Oklahoma. In trying to empathize with the rationale of Trump supporters, Ben has missed the simplest of all. Every voter wants an honest government, and a government for the people. We all want an end to   . Trump is the outsider, promising to be the outsider, just as Obama did in 2008. Those of us here, who voted for POTUS Obama in  ’12, feel let down. We’ve seen some social progress, but failures everywhere else, and we are willing to give the outsider the benefit of the doubt. Consider this: Oklahoma Evangelicals came out for Trump, actually crowded the polling stations, despite his playboy ways and lewd talk. They didn’t rush to the polls because of the usual divisive social issues they rarely do. They just want someone, anyone, to make a change against politics as usual. But if Trump supporters really “want an honest government,” why would they elect a pathologically dishonest person? Here’s our last reader for now, Sean, who echoes some of the themes above: A little background information: I am a    Wisconsinite that voted for Hillary Clinton. I consider myself a     moderate, simply because I find the idea silly and impossible that one party has the correct answer for every single issue our country and world faces. I’m still processing the events of the election result, but I feel like this is a perfect time to submit my first email to The Atlantic. Although readers Ben and Adam had unique insights as to why some people were compelled to vote for Trump, I respectfully disagree. I think there are two reasons for Trump’s victory: First, I believe it was simply a backlash to the American “system. ” I believe Trump won the election because most people my age and younger have already   with socially progressive ideas but yearned for a change in economic stances and the “status quo. ” Trump represented a change in the political machine while Clinton basically represented more of the same political gamesmanship. Progressive social ideology was not enough for Clinton to court enough voters because again, I think most young voters have already accepted progressive ideas to be the norm. Now, why a lot of my peers think Trump will be a good change to the political machine (which I do not agree with) is a different discussion . .. Second, I think that this is the first time a vast majority of the electorate has ranked a candidate’s message above that candidates “character. ” By that, I mean that a lot of people were willing to bite the bullet for Trump’s glaring character flaws for the chance to try a new approach to the American experiment. In previous elections, it was always assumed that the two candidates would be extremely polished, and would be immediately disqualified for saying some of the things Trump said. However, I think he was able to brush past these traditional political land mines due to an unexpected effect from my first point: a lot of people were sick and tired of traditional politics. They put much more weight into a candidates political message rather than their personal character. Update from Dan, who gets the last word here: Thank you so much for your kind words about my note on feeling empathy for Trump supporters. I do take issue with the implication of what you wrote in the “in other words” section following my note: Or in other words, two wrongs don’t make a right, even if one of those wrongs —  outright bigotry —  is much worse than the other —  an   to label someone a bigot. And the latter is counterproductive to fighting the former. Perhaps I was not clear enough, but my belief is that liberal bullying of perceived bigots is only a tangential effect of progress in dismantling system of social privilege and power. It is not part of the work to dismantle those systems it is merely the result of marginalized people finally gaining the power to express their anger at those who have been collectively furthering their oppression in individually minor ways. It is a problem that will inevitable arise with a new balance of social power, especially without any widespread engagement from the right or even acceptance of the reality of these concrete issues of marginalization and oppression, without some sort of “truth and reconciliation” for American society. It is not actually a part of the work that is being done to address these issues, so I disagree with the implication I see in your comment that this behavior must be stopped before we can continue making progress. If people oppose the dismantling of systems of privilege because of these cases of bullying, and instead support the resurgence of straight white male supremacy, that is a failure on their part. It is a failure of perspective and values and they are responsible for that failure. And that failure of perspective brings me to the email from the person who “voted for the wrecking ball. ” That person knows so many things about this country. That person knows exactly what you need to do to succeed and overcome adversity. That person knows exactly how all their fellow white people feel about marginalized groups and how they would treat marginalized people if those people could only be just a little better. That person does not know what they do not know about the experience of life as a marginalized person in this country. That person does not know that the opportunities his parents and their parents and their parents had to pursue the right kind of life were not afforded to the parents of others. That person does not know that the issues marginalized people complain about are not excuses for a failure of hard work they are legitimate and real challenges that this person has not experienced. That person does not know that it’s not that “not everyone starts off on the same spot” it’s that many grow up constantly being dragged down and boxed in by the people around them. That person does not know that bigoted speech, whether they agree that it is bigoted or not, leads to harmful action. But on that last point, your reader will likely learn better. Because he knows that his “wrecking ball” will leave him relatively untouched. But he doesn’t know that the hateful people swinging this wrecking ball with him are real, not a liberal bogeyman. He does not know that marginalized people are going to be hurt they are going to die because of this. They are going to keep being hurt and keep dying for years because of this. And the people who voted for Trump —  however understandable and relatable their motivations might be —  are responsible for this, whether they know it or not. The   just restored his webpage calling for a ban on all Muslims entering the country. https:  .  Fallows is traveling again, this time in Wyoming, and he’s also busy working on a new piece for the magazine, so he passed along several “powerful” emails from a reader named Vasav who served in the U. S. military and is the son of Indian immigrants. His first note is from a few weeks ago: Yes, let’s not demonize Trump voters as a “basket of deplorables. ” And no, we shouldn’t give in to their demands that sacrifice our basic, democratic tenets. But a widening income gap and a lack of opportunity, a political class more and more removed from the average voter, and the   wars that seem to be the fate of winning the Cold War and our politicians try to ignore come election time —  those are all legitimate gripes that I actually find myself nodding along when Trump talks about them. I would never vote for him or his solutions to these problems. But rather than completely ignore Trumpers, as tempting as it is, they have legitimate gripes that ought to be heard. Their mouthpiece is an oaf and a threat to democracy, women, minorities, and a world order I believe is beneficial to our country and freedom around the world. But their gripes are real, and the price of not listening at all may be more dire than any of us could have imagined. Yesterday, following the stunning news of Trump’s win, Vasav followed up: There is one exceptionally annoying narrative that has started to come down, about how rural voters were “making themselves heard” with Trump. The last couple of emails I wrote to you talked about why there is some validity to the claim that middle America is ignored by coastal elites. And to put it in personal perspective, I am a man of color and child of immigrants who was born on one coast, got college degrees, and traveled to work in one of the bougiest parts of the world on the other coast. It is ridiculous for me to tell a poor kid living in a trailer who has no real path to college in today’s America that he’s benefiting from white privilege. But the flip side is, considering their candidate lost the popular vote, considering in 2012 more votes were cast for Democratic congressmen, and yet despite that the party that has lost raw vote totals controls the totality of two branches of government —  well, it’s ridiculous for anyone to say they haven’t been heard. Republicans have disproportionately controlled the government since 2000. The deck is stacked in their favor. And rural Americans have chosen Tea Party candidates and now Donald Trump as their standard bearer. Everything I said before remains true: There’s a gap that needs to be bridged. I hope Donald Trump can do it. But it should be noted that bridge needs to flow in both directions. It’s not just about listening to the concerns of   whites it’s about listening to the concerns of coastal people of color who are now wondering whether middle America will let us stay in this country. From a personal perspective, I’ve loved and believed in America for a long time, and was inspired that Barack Obama called Chicago his home. Since before I started college in Michigan and just imagined setting foot in the Big House, I believed in middle America. I experienced some racism in the military, but on the whole my love for every part of this country grew. And now I have to ask: Does the America I’ve always loved, and specifically the middle of this country —  the part I’ve defended, gone out of my way to understand, endorsed as a place to live to my skeptical friends —  does the America I’ve literally served and fought for still want me around? It’s hard to look at the results and think the answer is still yes. In another email sent before Election Day, Vasav detailed “some harebrained ideas” for addressing “the fragility of American democracy that is becoming more and more apparent”: In the short term, enforce the Hatch Act. If members of the government are using their professional position to affect the election, they’re not just violating federal law, they are undermining their oath of office: “To protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. ” A series of firings are too close to a purge for anyone’s liking, but there must be teeth to this law. I believe, perhaps naively, that enough of our public servants will actually feel remorse if pulled to the mat and being told their actions question their integrity to their oath of office and their love of country and constitution. Public apologies won’t do much, but a thorough independent review —  as the AG’s office did of Ferguson PD’s emails and correspondence —  will force the country to confront the FBI. There’s no disinfectant like sunlight. Longer term, the gap needs to be bridged. Why is it that growing up in Jersey and now living in Cali, I am far less exposed to Republicans than when I served in the military? Why don’t more liberals join the military? Why do so many Republicans join the government but have no faith in the powers and controls of the federal government as headquartered in D. C.? There is both a   and a geographic segregation in this country. It needs to be addressed aggressively. But how? For one, public service looks a lot worse when you’re part of the economic ladder that expects to go to college and earn a boatload of money from the new economy. We need government officers from everywhere and every breadth of society. Government needs to reform by trying to attract the best talent to civil and military service —  and not just as campaign consultants. For another, Fallows’s series on America by air highlights how hard people are working throughout the forgotten heartlands of this country to remake and rebuild their communities to link into and actively push forward the new economy. Investments in education and infrastructure were a boon to the economy throughout the country in the 1870s and 1950s. We are due for another round so that the centers of growth aren’t just where there’s oil and increasingly elite metropolises. Most importantly, more Americans need to be aware of why and how the levers of power work the way they do, in D. C. and elsewhere. I’m an engineer, with two degrees in the subject and my experience in the military was engineering too. So you know I believe in the value of a technical skill set. But I think every high school senior should learn and debate civics and government. Start with how ours works and has evolved instead of dropping it at the   version that children learn and forget with broad strokes on the constitution. But also how democracy, government and politics works around the world and has evolved throughout history. Talk to them about fascist strongmen, about how and why the classical republics gave way to military dictatorships and then feudal systems, tie it into the changing economics, and include lessons in how a parliamentary system works. And do it at an age where they can actually think and process and challenge and learn to   to our system of government. Finally (and admittedly this is both costly and probably only cosmetic) how annoying is it that the elites of our government sit on the coast, a short train ride away from the elites of our private sectors? Both of our presidential candidates base themselves in our largest city and metro, and naturally the teams they’ve put together have strong ties to NYC as well. It’s literally a morning’s ride on the rails to D. C. I propose Congress and the Supreme Court (and possibly the president) move to either East St. Louis or Kansas City, Kansas. Missouri is a great state that’s both east and west, north and south, Midwest but not. Either side of the state has a large metro that too many of my coastal friends would not be able to find on a map of the U. S. If we moved Congress to the middle of the country, we can both give D. C. voting rights and create a small, federal “District of Lincoln” that forces coastal political and economic elites to worry about their brethren in the middle of the country. Update from Vasav: Chris, I’d like to add one addendum. I just talked with a buddy of mine who I served with. He is, like I was, an officer. Unlike me, he stayed in. Also unlike me, he voted for Trump. I’ll try to keep this short, but he frankly didn’t believe a lot the Trump rhetoric that has me nervous. He also took the time to listen to my concerns and understand how I don’t have the luxury of ignoring that rhetoric. In a small way, Justin restored my faith that, while some Trumpers would not make this country safe for me, there are plenty who would stand by my side if things every really got crazy. A   reader, Ben, tries to understand what drove so many Americans to elect Donald Trump yesterday: So to get it out of the way: I didn’t vote for Trump. So I don’t like the results any better than you and your magazine do. But I did consider supporting Trump here and there, so I think I probably have a slightly    answer to “how could this have happened?” And I really think it’s kind of simple: Some people voted for Trump, but way more people voted for “stop calling me names and being a bully. ” I think the left was right on gay marriage, at least in the sense of “it should be legal if the government is going to have their hands in it. ” But immediately after it became an inevitability, it also became a club: If your pizza   baking   business doesn’t want to be part of it, you get vilified and threatened. If the fringier parts of the left had its way, Brendan Eich’s ouster would have been duplicated a thousand times. I think the left is right that black people are still treated like a subclass and don’t get anywhere near a fair shake. But traveling down the right road, there were plenty of pit stops that signaled that free speech was an acceptable sacrifice. There was a    smattering of clues that private opinions would be dug out at any cost and used to get you fired from your job. The far left took a gamble that calling half the country racist, backwoods, bigoted hicks wouldn’t unite them under literally any alternate flag. It said, “If you aren’t 100 percent with us, you are 100 percent evil” without considering that inevitably this would result in absolutely no motivation for anyone on the right to shift even a little to the left. Give people the impression that you will hate them the same or nearly so for voting Jeb Bush as compared to voting for Trump, and where is the motivation to be socially acceptable with Jeb? The far left took the gamble, and the moderate left backed them up with a range of active support and silence. And somebody popped up who said whatever he wanted. People called him a racist bigot idiot who wouldn’t fit in in San Francisco, and it bounced off. So he’s a racist and a bigot for real. You think people wouldn’t envy his bulletproof vest? If the left had been responsible with its dominance of culture, media, and social mores, this would have been an easy win for them —  more than that, Trump would have never been possible. I would have liked that. At the same time, it’s hard to feel guilty when I see a lot of people who just got done saying “We will destroy everything you believe in and make it impossible to be anything but us” for years and now finding out it backfired. A bully can be right and still be a bully. The bullied can be wrong and still fight back. I hope this lesson is understood and remembered. Disagree with Ben? Or, are you an American who voted for Donald Trump and would like to share your thoughts right now? Please send us a note and we’ll post: hello@theatlantic. com. Update from reader Adam, who has a strong dissent against Ben: I’m a San Francisco native (so yea, a bleeding heart liberal) completing a masters program in Kansas, where I’ve encountered plenty of Trump support, and specifically the sorts of embittered White culture Ben describes. While I’ve met plenty of people on the social   who feel bullied as Ben describes, I do disagree that they have any right to their victimhood —  specifically on gay rights and the harassment of business owners who refused service to gay customers. Ben considers this the left “bullying” the right, but in doing so he overlooks this country’s dark (and RECENT) history of businesses refusing service to minority groups —  a comparatively extreme form of bullying. In the communities I visit in Kansas, it is racial and sexual minority groups who must cope with bullying in the    sometimes physical sense —  far more consequential than the   bullying from the media. Yes, the left is shrill and   and sure, people on both sides of the aisle cross the line. The difference is that fundamentally, the right’s positions on cultural issues is to eliminate the liberties of minority groups —  religious, sexual, racial, and otherwise, whereas even if the left can be bullies, it’s in the name of increasing individual liberties. There are ethically gray areas like abortion, sure, but there’s nothing to debate when it comes about the right to receive service at local private businesses and government institutions (i. e. Kim Davis). So, is it really realistic to expect the left (also flawed humans, mind) to reach out to the right on these issues —  especially when so many in power, and out of it, continue to campaign aggressively to deny liberties to others? There’s simply no equivalency here. Having friends who are    when I hear   rhetoric, I become angry and scared, not put in a place to “hash out differences. ” To Ben’s point: Bottom line, from the standpoint of diplomacy, the left could have done more to court the religious and social  . Maybe won the election. But ethically, it’s the people who hold the myopic, prejudiced, and yes, hateful views who are culpable for this president. I have no sympathy, because the   I’ve met in Kansas? They are smart enough to know better. More of your emails to come. For the time being, be sure to read Peter Beinart’s latest, “After Trump, a Call for Political Correctness From the Right,” which runs through evidence suggesting that Trump supporters, on average, have more bigoted views toward blacks, Muslims, and women. Money quote: In general, conservatives prefer cultural to materialist analyses of human behavior. For years, for instance, conservatives have insisted that economic distress does not cause jihadist terror. The real source, they insist, is Islamic culture. For decades, they’ve argued that economic distress does not cause unwed pregnancy and drug addiction among African Americans. The real explanation lies with inner city black culture. Given those precedents, you would think conservatives would embrace a cultural rather than economic explanation for Trump’s appeal, especially when the evidence points so strongly in that direction. But when it’s whites acting badly, not blacks or Muslims, suddenly economic distress matters a great deal.      Update from Ben, who first responds to me asking if he’d like me to add his last name for the sake of public attribution: I betcha I could get fired for that note if people didn’t read it carefully, and you and I both know nobody does. I don’t think the “I don’t like Trump either, but there’s fundamental problems that exist on both sides that made him possible” message would probably parse well. I like reader Adam’s   and dance around the actual issues I brought up. I mention a pizza place that never refused to serve anyone and a wedding cake shop, and he brings up Kim Davis. For the record I don’t think scorching Kim Davis was bad, and where vital services are at play, I generally agree with Adam. But the general immediate dismissal of everything else I bought up —  firings for private views, freedom of speech on campus and elsewhere being squelched —  is sort of proof of my point. Even without getting into the “let’s change culture to completely cut these people out” aspect being addressed, Adam called everyone on the right a racist bigot who just wants to crush minorities and the LGBT community. That’s his —   and a large portion of the left’s —    reaction for dismissing all of their problems. It’s not just not “courting” that Trump vote. I wasn’t suggesting the left should change their views or be disingenuous. I’m just suggesting that it’s not the best tactic to say: If you are a Republican or conservative in any way, that means you are a homophobic bigot racist. I’m going to immediately assume all your problems are fake and all of your complaints are invalid. I’m going to actively work against you in all things. And again, this isn’t about winning their votes it’s about giving them any motivation to care about anything you think at all. I’m not suggesting the left should have been trying to get Hillary in the White House. I’m suggesting that they should have tried to get Jeb Bush campaigning instead of Trump. But, hey, guy, keep doing the same stuff it’s totally not like you didn’t generate a giant backlash that pushed the worst candidate ever into the presidency or anything. Sorry, rant over. And yeah, the election really sucks. I abstained from the vote for reasons probably obvious to you if you’ve been tracking my personal politics, but I definitely don’t consider Trump to be anything but a horrible outcome."
57561,79023,The Near Certainty of Anti-Police Violence,Atlantic,Ta-Nehisi Coates,2016-07-12,2016.0,7.0,,"   I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Last month, the Obama administration accused Donald Trump of undercutting American legitimacy in the eyes of the world. Trump’s call to ban Muslims wasn’t just morally wrong, according to Vice President Joe Biden, it called “into question America’s status as the greatest democracy in the history of the world. ” President Obama followed Biden by asserting that Trump’s rhetoric “doesn’t reflect our democratic ideals,” saying “it will make us less safe, fueling ISIL’s notion that the West hates Muslims. ” His point was simple —  wanton discrimination in policy and rhetoric undercuts American legitimacy and fuels political extremism. This lesson is not limited to Donald Trump, and it applies as well abroad as it does at home. Last week,    Micah Xavier Johnson murdered five police officers in Dallas. This abhorrent act of political extremism cannot be divorced from American history —  recent or old. In black communities, the police departments have only enjoyed a kind of  . That is because wanton discrimination is definitional to the black experience, and very often it is law enforcement which implements that discrimination with violence. A community consistently subjected to violent discrimination under the law will lose respect for it, and act beyond it. When such actions stretch to mass murder it is horrific. But it is also predictable. To understand the lack of police legitimacy in black communities, consider the contempt in which most white Americans hold O. J. Simpson. Consider their feelings toward the judge and jury in the case. And then consider that this is approximately how black people have felt every few months for generations. It’s not just that the belief that Officer Timothy Loehmann got away with murdering a    Tamir Rice, it is the reality that police officers have been getting away with murdering black people since the advent of American policing. The injustice compounds, congeals until there is an almost tangible sense of dread and grievance that compels a community to understand the police as objects of fear, not respect. What does it mean, for instance, that black children are ritually told that any stray movement in the face of the police might result in their own legal killing? When Eric Holder spoke about getting “The Talk” from his father, and then giving it to his own son, many of us nodded our heads. But many more of us were terrified. When the nation’s top cop must warn his children to be skeptical of his own troops, how legitimate can the police actually be? And it is not as if Holder is imagining things. When the law shoots down  down    children, or beats down old women on traffic islands, or chokes people to death over cigarettes when the law shoots people over compact discs, traffic stops, drivers’ licenses, loud conversation, or car trouble when the law auctions off its monopoly on lethal violence to bemused civilians, when these civilians then kill, and when their victims are mocked in their death throes when people stand up to defend police as officers of the state, and when these defenders are killed by these very same officers when much of this is recorded, uploaded,   tweeted, and broadcast and when government seems powerless, or unwilling, to stop any of it, then it ceases, in the eyes of citizens, to be any sort of respectable law at all. It simply becomes “force. ” In the black community, it’s the force they deploy, and not any higher American ideal, that gives police their power. This is obviously dangerous for those who are policed. Less appreciated is the danger illegitimacy ultimately poses to those who must do the policing. For if the law represents nothing but the greatest force, then it really is indistinguishable from any other street gang. And if the law is nothing but a gang, then it is certain that someone will resort to the kind of justice typically meted out to all other powers in the street.  The Talk is testament to something that went very wrong, long ago, with law enforcement, something that we are scared to see straight. That something has very little to do with the officer on the beat and everything to do with ourselves. There’s a sense that the police departments of America have somehow gone rogue. In fact, the police are one of the most trusted institutions in the country. This is not a paradox. The policies which the police carry out are not the edicts of a dictatorship but the work, as Biden put it, of “the greatest democracy in the history of the world. ” Avoiding this fact is central to the current conversation around “police reform” which focuses solely on the actions of police officers and omits everything that precedes these actions. But analyzing the present crisis in law enforcement solely from the contested street, is like analyzing the Iraq War solely from the perspective of Abu Ghraib. And much like the Iraq War, there is a strong temptation to focus on the problems of “implementation,” as opposed to building the kind of equitable society in which police force is used as sparingly as possible. There is no   out. Sanctimonious cries of nonviolence will not help. “Retraining” can only do so much. Until we move to the broader question of policy, we can  expect to see Walter Scotts and Freddie Grays with some regularity. And the extent to which we are tolerant of the possibility of more Walter Scotts and Freddie Grays is the extent to which we are tolerant of the possibility of more Micah Xavier Johnsons."
57916,79474,What Is Matt Damon Doing on Top of The Great Wall?,Atlantic,David Sims,2016-08-02,2016.0,8.0,,"        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, The poster for The Great Wall, an epic     coming out next February, is remarkable simply for managing to say so much about the film industry today with so little detail. The frame is filled by Matt Damon’s sweaty face, backgrounded by the Great Wall of China, engulfed in battle. “1700 Years to Build 5550 Miles Long What Were They Trying to Keep Out?” the tagline asks. “MATT DAMON,” the billing beneath it seems to reply. An Encouraging New World for Superheroes, The Great Wall may well represent the next step in Hollywood economics: A film made by one of the country’s greatest directors (Zhang Yimou) shot on location in China and telling a story about the Northern Song Dynasty, while starring one of Hollywood’s biggest names. The Great Wall, with a budget of $135 million, is the most expensive Chinese film ever made. As China becomes a bigger and bigger part of the overall   market, it makes sense that Hollywood would produce more films designed to appeal directly to the country’s audiences. But the poster alone has sparked an outcry that the film’s creators should have seen coming from 5, 500 miles away —  especially given all the recent attention paid to the industry’s lack of diversity in front of and behind the camera. The Great Wall is now the most dramatic example of whitewashing: Though it’s rooted in Chinese history and culture, and is made by a Chinese director and studio, the film is already relying solely on the face of a   white American actor to sell its story. Damon is, by all accounts, a   guy with   politics, but he’s already once been embroiled in a debate over Hollywood’s institutional racism after a   episode of his HBO filmmaking show Project Greenlight. Now, less than a year later, the man who lectured the   producer Effie Brown over the limits of diversity in Hollywood is the face of a film that embodies all of the industry’s worst tendencies, by yet again putting a white American actor at the center of another culture’s story. The film’s trailer is by all accounts spectacular Zhang is known as one of Chinese cinema’s greatest visual stylists for a reason. But Damon speaks the only lines, and is the only actor billed, despite the presence of   cinema legends like Andy Lau and Zhang Hanyu. One imagines that in China, the advertising will tell a different story, and the poster won’t be as  . Hollywood has been    featuring Asian actors and locations in many of its recent blockbusters to appeal to a wider market. Transformers: Age of Extinction, the fourth in the   action series, was released to poor reviews in 2014 and was the franchise’s lowest grosser in the United States. But in China, it was the most successful film in the country’s history, partly because its final act was shot in China (including some segments by the Great Wall and the extended destruction of Hong Kong). Iron Man 3 contained an extra four minutes of footage that were only shown in China, including an obvious bit of product placement for the popular drink Gu Li Duo. Both films, like The Great Wall, were partly financed with Chinese money both, of course, featured white American stars (Mark Wahlberg and Robert Downey Jr. respectively). Still, you could be forgiven for thinking a film about the Great Wall of China, set in the 11th century, would rely somewhat less on typical   —  perhaps featuring a diverse ensemble cast. Amid the maelstrom of criticism that greeted the poster and trailer, the Taiwanese American actress Constance Wu (and star of the ABC sitcom Fresh Off the Boat) stood out for her blistering condemnation of her own industry’s approach to telling stories about other cultures. “We have to stop perpetuating the racist myth that only a white man can save the world,” she said. “We don’t need salvation. We like our color and our culture and our own strengths and our own stories. ” Wu correctly poked holes in the pervasive myth that white actors guarantee a better   take worldwide, which is constantly thrown out as an excuse for not putting actors of color in leading roles. Films like Gods of Egypt (which saw white actors playing Egyptians) Pan (where Rooney Mara played the Native American Tiger Lily) and Aloha (where Emma Stone played a   character) were all   bombs, while Star Wars: The Force Awakens (which had a black male lead) and Furious 7 (with an ensemble full of actors of color) were two of the biggest hits of 2015. “Money is the lamest excuse,” Wu said. “So is blaming Chinese investors, [whose] choices can be based on unconscious bias too. ” The Great Wall is not the only upcoming Hollywood blockbuster guilty of blatant whitewashing: Projects like Doctor Strange, with Tilda Swinton playing a Tibetan monk, and Ghost in the Shell, with Scarlett Johansson in the lead role of a film based on a famous work of Japanese anime, have also been decried. Each film might have its own complicated reasons for arriving at said casting decisions: With Doctor Strange, Marvel Studios claimed it was trying to avoid political difficulties with the Chinese government, while the reaction within Japan to the Ghost in the Shell casting news was surprisingly muted, partly because of the intentionally vague portrayal of race in anime. But no matter what the intentions behind its production, The Great Wall feels like a huge step in the wrong direction, a critical disaster waiting to happen no matter what the economic justification for its existence might be. Last month, Marvel and Warner Bros. advertised a slate of highly anticipated films starring women and actors of color at their   panels. China is poised to one day outstrip the United States as the biggest movie market on Earth. If Hollywood wants to keep pace with its audience, it will stop blindly casting actors like Damon and give more chances to performers typically overlooked by the industry."

Please follow the steps below, NEWS BRIEF For Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, their joint campaign stop Monday in Scranton, Pennsylvania, was a play for the swing state’s crucial voters, particularly those from the white working class who Donald Trump has taken pains to attract.  Donald Trump’s Intolerance for Intolerance, But it was also something of a homecoming: Both the vice president and Clinton’s father, Hugh Rodham, were born in the city, a former   and manufacturing hub. Biden has long used Scranton as a symbol of the American dream, and often invokes his early years there as evidence he’s a man of the people. During his remarks Monday, he framed Clinton as a fellow child of Scranton: the product of one of its families, yes, but also of its ethos.  The city “is made up of so many people with grit and courage —  I mean this sincerely, from the bottom of my heart —  with grit, courage, determination, who never, never, ever give up,” Biden said. “They deserve someone who not only understands them, they deserve someone who’s with them. And they deserve someone who’s made of the same stuff. That’s Hillary Clinton. That’s who she is. ” Monday’s rally marked Biden’s first appearance on the campaign trail with Clinton, his former Senate and Obama administration colleague. The two were originally scheduled to visit Scranton before the Democratic National Convention in July, where Biden gave a lengthy address on Clinton’s behalf. That trip was canceled after five police officers were killed in a shooting ambush in Dallas, Texas. During the Democrats’ Philadelphia convention, Trump made a visit to Scranton, where he vowed to restore manufacturing and mining jobs in Pennsylvania. “No state is more central to Mr. Trump’s uphill quest” for the presidency, The New York Times noted this week, though it’s voted Democrat in every presidential election since 1992. The Wall Street Journal recently reported on Scranton’s —  and Pennsylvania’s —  significance going into November: Known as the setting for NBC’s comedy “The Office,” Scranton is the kind of community that is expected to be at the center of the fight between Republican Donald Trump and Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump’s path to the White House depends on winning big margins among white,   supporters to offset a major Democratic demographic advantage among nonwhites, especially in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. Scranton has long been solidly Democratic territory, but Mr. Trump hopes to change that, capitalizing on the region’s economic stagnation and anger over illegal immigration. For Mrs. Clinton, a key challenge will be to prevent further erosion of her support among   whites —  a likely reason Mr. Biden has been tapped to aid her. Biden serves as a useful surrogate for Clinton. He’s “courted” white   voters “with success in his more than four decades in politics,” the Los Angeles Times writes, adding that the vice president targeted these voters during President Obama’s two races. Her choice of running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, was widely seen as an appeal to this voting bloc as well. While introducing Biden, Clinton told   about her family’s history in the city: how she was christened there, how her grandfather worked at the Scranton Lace Company, giving her dad a chance to go to Penn State. Her dad then similarly provided for her. “No matter where life takes me, I always remember: I am the granddaughter of a factory worker and the daughter of a small businessowner and I am so proud of it. ” Then, drawing connections with Biden: “The story of the Rodhams and the Bidens isn’t unique,” Clinton said. “What’s unique is the country where those stories were written. ” She also went after Trump: “Friends should not let friends vote for Trump,” Clinton told the audience, before pivoting to his company’s treatment of its workers. Trump has praised his organization’s   program, though the Associated Press has reported that’s solely for guests of his properties. “If you work for his business —  if you clean the rooms, water the lawns, carry people’s bags, you get nothing,” Clinton said. Biden, too, turned to Trump toward the end of his remarks. He characterized the Republican nominee as a man disconnected from everyday Americans and one incapable of keeping them and their children safe. Biden said he would’ve “thrown my body” in front of his late son, Beau, an Iraq War veteran, before letting him serve under President Trump. “My word as a Biden, no   nominee in the history of the United States of America —  don’t cheer, just listen —  has known less or been less prepared to deal with our national security than Donald Trump,” he said."
58456,80137,How Ransomware Became a Billion-Dollar Nightmare for Businesses,Atlantic,Adam Chandler,2016-09-03,2016.0,9.0,,"        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, In recent months, a proliferation of ransomware attacks has affected everyone from   and   owners to hospitals and police departments. An attack works like this: A virus arrives and encrypts a company’s data then a message appears demanding a fee of hundreds or thousands of dollars. If the ransom is paid in time, the information is restored. “At the heart of this new business model for cybercrime is the fact that individuals and businesses, not retailers and banks, are the ones footing the bill for data breaches,” Josephine Wolff noted in The Atlantic back in June. According to an FBI tally, ransomware attacks cost their victims a total of $209 million in the first three months of 2016, a stunning surge upward from $24 million in all of 2015. However, that figure was based only on the complaints that victims reported to the bureau. In a new report, Datto, a   cybersecurity company, offers an alarmingly higher estimate that accounts for unreported incidents and lost productivity, which costs businesses far more than paying ransoms does. The company’s survey of 1, 100 IT professionals found that nearly 92 percent had clients that suffered ransomware attacks in the last year, including 40 percent whose clients had sustained at least six attacks. The report found that “less than 1 in 4 ransomware incidents are reported to the authorities. ” Factoring in the cost and average amount of time lost to infections —  an overwhelming majority of small businesses hit by ransomware face at least two days of downtime —  as well as the number of businesses affected by them, Datto suggests that the financial impact of this brand of cybercrime starts in the range of $75 billion each year. The company arrived at this figure based on an estimate from the Aberdeen Group, a consultancy, that an hour of inactivity costs small companies an average of $8, 581 per hour. By comparison, Datto’s survey indicated that about   of the IT professionals said the ransoms paid were somewhere between $100 and $2, 000. Overall, Datto estimates that $375 million has been paid out in ransoms in the past year, making lost productivity the much bigger concern. Joe Gleinser, the president of GCS Technologies, an   IT support and services company, walked me through just how   it is for companies to deal with ransomware attacks, which generally starts with the appearance of “unusually named files” or files that suddenly can’t be accessed. “Locking the network down” —  freezing some or all of a company’s systems —  is typically the first step after the attack is recognized, in an effort to stop the damage and look for fixes. “So that’s productivity hit number one,” he said. For a small business, that can mean an entire operation for a larger one, it could mean a section or a division. “Obviously in certain industries that’s a lot more painful,” Gleinser added. “In health care, that can mean patients going untreated. If you don’t have that information, you don’t know what drugs were prescribed and sometimes it’s tough to make decisions. ” Earlier this year, operations at a Los Angeles hospital came to a near halt, leaving staff to use faxes and paper notes to communicate before a $17, 000 ransom was paid. If a business has a     system in place, data may be restored with only some small delays and limited expense. Should a sufficient   not be possible and should the inaccessible files be deemed important enough, the second step is paying the ransom, a practice that the FBI discourages, but says is not illegal under most circumstances. “Paying the ransom is tricky business,” said Gleinser. “You’re dealing with criminals. ” While many ransomers operate quickly, even attentively, that is not always the case. Datto’s survey found that 7 percent of IT professionals reported incidents where data was not restored even after a ransom was paid. But even paying the ransom can be tricky. “If you don’t have Bitcoin right now, you’re probably not going to get it before the timer expires on the infection,” Gleinser said. “Many of these infections, as soon as you start the process to engage with the ransomer   …     you have about 48 hours before the data is   to encourage you to move quickly. ” As one cybersecurity company executive told Business Insider last month, banks have started to keep tens of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin ready in case of an attack. “Buying bitcoin on any one of the U. S. exchanges is a    day wait time, so we’ve been forced into the position of having to stock bitcoin as if it were computer equipment and have it ready for our use,” Gleinser added. And even if a company is prepared to pay, when the deadline arrives, the price can jump, sometime double, triple, or even quadruple, or the data can be rendered permanently unrecoverable. “We’ve seen some clients who had paid the ransom and then immediately get attacked again,” he added. So who is doing this? Ransomware attacks originate largely in Russian or Eastern European outfits, but in recent years, they’ve come from all over the world. Quoting FBI statistics, Gleinser says an average of 4, 000 ransomware episodes now take place each day, mostly with no ideological rhyme or reason. These   attacks have changed a basic business calculus whereby employers and management have started looking outward for threats instead of inward. “We’ve told clients the last 15 years, the number one threat is not the boogeyman, it’s   …     the third party you’ve already given access to your network. Disgruntled staff has by far been the largest security risk our clients have dealt with historically,” Gleinser said. “It’s not definitely true in this day and age. There definitely is a boogeyman out to get these guys. ” With Bitcoin enabling easier and less traceable methods of cybercrime, ransomware attacks will almost certainly not be the boogeyman’s final evolution.

58810,80600,Transparentâ€™s Third Season Is a Powerful Plea for Compassion,Atlantic,Spencer Kornhaber,2016-09-23,2016.0,9.0,,"        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, Have you heard of the Tzadikim Nistarim? It s the Talmudic term for the  36 people whose righteousness sustains the world, ? an  insurance policy ? against the apocalypse, as Transparent s Rabbi Raquel (Kathryn Hahn) explains during a worship ceremony midway through the show s third season.  Who are these 36? ? Raquel asks as congregants link arms in candlelight.  We don t know. Even the 36 don t know. So what is the lesson? The lesson is to treat each other as if we might be one. Or who knows, we might be standing next to one right now. ? It s a tale out of Judaism, but the underlying message is familiar across belief systems. Christianity s Golden Rule gets at the same idea. So does Transparent s poignant and clever third season, which fixates on the notion of reserving compassion and dignity for all whether when dealing with estranged relatives or dominatrixes. The tension of the    Amazon dramedy lies in the fact that its central family, the Pfeffermans, seem unable to muster anything like true kindness for anyone. They wrongly believe happiness must be extracted from others rather than arise from generosity. The 2016 Emmy Awards Point to TV’s Power, The first season humanized a   and deeply flawed Los Angeles family reacting to its longtime patriarch identifying as a transgender woman named Maura. The second season portrayed the Pfeffermans blowing up their lives and using the trappings of social progress as a pretext for selfishness. The third season is gentler yet somehow more piercing: These characters have amassed some wisdom but are still missing the most important lessons. Early on, Maura (Jeffrey Tambor) marvels that she has everything she once hoped for but still burns with the question, Why am I so unhappy? ? Transparent then answers amply. The excellent and tragicomic first episode establishes the season s central struggle while showing a deepened interest in economic disparities and race. Maura is working at a help line for LGBT youths and fields a call from a young trans woman in a poorer part of L. A. They establish a connection but the woman hangs up, sending Maura to break protocol and seek out the caller in real life. By the farcical end of her journey, Maura has collapsed in stress and is pleading to be taken to the richer Jewish hospital rather than the overcrowded county one. It s clear that her supposed humanitarian mission has only been a burden on others, and it s clear that she undertook it more for her own sake than anyone else s. It s a pattern that recurs through the season, as attempts at connection backfire for reasons of selfishness.  I m not your fucking adventure! ? screams Shea, a trans sex worker played with serene confidence by Trace Lysette, to Josh Pfefferman (Jay Duplass) after his offer of friendship has taken on a tinge of voyeurism and disgust. At another point, Sarah Pfefferman (Amy Landecker) realizes that she has never performed a true charitable act in her life according to the Jewish doctrine that says philanthropy is invalidated by talking about it. When Ali Pfefferman (Gaby Hoffmann) goes out of her way to help Josh in a difficult time, he can t be certain that she doesn t have an ulterior motive. And in the masterful finale, set on a cruise ship, the   matriarch Shelly finally gets some encouragement from the one person paid to show her unconditional kindness: a butler, or as he s referred to,  the gay who comes with the room. ? This may all sound bleak and meanspirited, an exploration of human nastiness. But the show creator Jill Soloway s deeply empathetic filmmaking style and her writers  penchant for fine, funny details give the series soul and prevent the characters from tipping over into full monstrousness. The performances are more precise than ever, naturalistically portraying people who are neither wholly good nor wholly bad. Most impressive is how Soloway s team keeps finding fresh angles on the same characters navigating the same big existential questions, whether through novel settings (an abandoned waterpark, a   evangelical service) or points of view (one episode opens through the eyes of a turtle, and another is entirely a flashback to Cold   suburbia). The grace of the show partly lies in the fact that the Pfeffermans are not quite an  : As viewers come to increasingly understand, they have been shaped by inherited trauma and have not quite figured out how not to responsibly enjoy the benefits of social liberation. Always, though, there are perfectly cast secondary characters standing by to give some perspective. In one of the best scenes the show has ever provided, the normally reserved and gracious Rabbi Raquel erupts in frustration at one of the Pfeffermans who s been talking about  spirituality. ?  Can you clarify for me really fast what spirituality is for you? ? she spits.  I can tell you what it s not. It s not changing your mind whenever you feel like it. It s not following your bliss. It s not finding yourself by climbing through your belly button and out your own asshole and calling it a journey. ? The questions of what spirituality actually is goes unanswered. But the show has made the truth of the matter plain enough, and enlightenment feels like something that the Pfeffermans could access were they able to treat others as they so desperately ask to be treated themselves."
59392,81321,How Did Maajid Nawaz End Up on a List of ’Anti-Muslim Extremists’?,Atlantic,Siddhartha Mahanta,2016-10-29,2016.0,10.0,,"When earlier this week, the Southern Poverty Law Center and three other groups released a list of 15 “  extremists,” many of the names came as no surprise. They included Pam Geller, who led the fight against the misleadingly nicknamed Ground Zero mosque, and her ally Frank Gaffney, who has called Barack Obama a   and assailed Grover Norquist as a Islamist agent. Others were more controversial, like Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who is beloved by some as a truthteller and reviled by others as a bigot. But one name in particular stuck out: Maajid Nawaz, a British activist who runs the Quilliam Foundation, which calls itself “the world’s first   think tank. ” (It’s named for Abdullah (né William) Quilliam, a British convert who opened the U. K.’s first mosque in 1889.) Nawaz is a star in certain   circles, thanks to a compelling personal narrative: A   former extremist who spent four years in an Egyptian prison, he has changed approaches and now argues for a pluralistic and peaceful vision of Islam. He stood for Parliament as a Liberal Democrat in 2015, and advised Prime Ministers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and David Cameron. Nawaz’s work has earned him detractors —  critics claim he has embellished or neatened his narrative, some attack him for opportunism, and others question his liberal bona fides —  but calling him an “  extremist” is a surprise. Unlike the likes of Gaffney and Geller, he doesn’t espouse the view that Islam itself is a problem unlike Ali, who now describes herself as an atheist, Nawaz identifies as a Muslim. When I spoke to Nawaz on Thursday, he was both baffled and furious. “They put a target on my head. The kind of work that I do, if you tell the wrong kind of Muslims that I’m an extremist, then that means I’m an target,” he said. “They don’t have to deal with any of this. I don’t have any protection. I don’t have any state protection. These people are putting me on what I believe is a hit list. ” Not that he took well to his inclusion on its merits, either. “I’m the one who’s a Muslim in this!” he said. “I’m listed there with people such as Pam Geller? It’s unbelievable. ” He pointed out that he does things like appear in an Intelligence Squared debate arguing for the proposition —  against Ali, in fact —  that Islam is a religion of peace. (“I lost the vote,” he said, with a tinge of bitterness.) He has also won praise for battling Islamophobes in the press. The report cited several counts against Nawaz. One is that he tweeted a cartoon of Muhammad —  an intentionally provocative act, given that many Sunnis find it blasphemous to depict the prophet, but one that doesn’t fit neatly into the “ ” category. (Most Shiites don’t object at all, but in any case, is simply committing a blasphemous act  ?) A second is that Nawaz visited a strip club in London during a bachelor party, which is true, tasteless, and seemingly irrelevant to the matter at hand. Third is a Daily Mail   about the niqab, or face veil. The report states that he “called for criminalizing the wearing of the veil, or niqab, in many public places. ” Nawaz counters that he only called it inappropriate. But he did write that their should be a “policy” barring the niqab in certain spaces: “Let me make this clear: it is our duty to adopt a policy barring the wearing of niqabs in these public buildings. Here’s my test: where a balaclava, motorcycle helmet or face mask would be deemed inappropriate, so should a niqab. ” The most interesting is the fourth point, because it highlights a peculiar dynamic: The SPLC and Nawaz are each accusing the other of McCarthyism. The report states: In the list sent to a top British security official in 2010, headlined “Preventing Terrorism: Where Next for Britain?” Quilliam wrote, “The ideology of   Islamists is broadly the same as that of violent Islamists they disagree only on tactics. ” An official with Scotland Yard’s Muslim Contact Unit told The Guardian that “[t]he list demonises a whole range of groups that in my experience have made valuable contributions to  . ” Nawaz disputes the claim. Quilliam says the list in question was an appendix to a larger report, and simply a list of British Muslim organizations in fact, he says, the point was to say that such groups should be legal, even if they were extremist, so long as they were not violent. “It wasn’t a terror list,” Nawaz said. “We were saying, don’t ban these groups. We’ve gone through the looking glass. It’s the direct opposite of my life’s work. ” He pointed to an exchange on the floor of Parliament, in which   Minister Gordon Brown cited him in defense of the notion that Islamist parties such as Hizb   with which Nawaz was affiliated in his radical days, ought not to be illegal: Even many of those who have left the groups and feel that they should be exposed are of the view that exposing them is not the same as banning them altogether. Maajid Nawaz, who talked about the matter on “Newsnight,” said: “My ideal scenario would be not to ban the party but it would be that through the   …     power of discussion and persuasion that eventually the party would fizzle out in this country. ” Mark Potok, a senior fellow at SPLC who wrote the report (and has a long resume of similar work on extremists) told me that Quilliam’s list of groups was the linchpin of the case for Nawaz as an   extremist. (Potok also noted that the list was compiled in collaboration with Media Matters for America, the Center for New Community, and ReThink Media.) Nawaz, meanwhile, accused SPLC of “McCarthyism” for compiling the guide. “Who compiles lists of individuals these days?” he said. “Even if someone was an   bigot, there shouldn’t be lists of names of individuals. ” Potok rejected the argument out of hand. “If criticizing any number of people is McCarthyism, then I guess the only answer to never criticize anyone. One can disagree or agree with a particular listing that we’ve made.   …     In some sense, to make a statement like that is to say that we shouldn’t criticize. ” He noted that SPLC was careful never to list addresses or contact information for those it labeled extremists. “Our point is not to make these people targets for violence, Potok said. “The point is to tamp down the really baseless targeting. ” While Nawaz demanded a correction, retraction, and apology, Potok said none was coming. One thing that seemed to particularly irk Nawaz was the fact that the report came from SPLC. While the group is controversial —  and particularly loathed on the American right —  Nawaz’s objection was that he has known and respected their work for years. “It lends the wingnuts a level of credibility,” he said. Yet Potok surely has a point about lists, even if one rejects Nawaz’s inclusion on this particular one. If naming and shaming the likes of Geller and Gaffney is beyond the pale, how should one combat Islamophobia, which is a real and growing problem? Nawaz endorsed the work of Tell MAMA UK, an organization that tracks attacks on Muslims and other incidents of Islamophobia. There are legitimate disagreements about the most effective way of fighting Islamophobia. There are also grounds to argue about whether what Quilliam is doing is truly making much difference. But what makes Nawaz’s appearance on the list so peculiar is that he and SPLC share the goal of fighting back against unfair targeting of Muslims. If even   allies are preoccupied fighting each other about tactics, what hope is there prevailing in the fight against real bigots?"
59881,81963,Is the White House Hiding Secrets About Russia’s Role in the Election?,Atlantic,Kaveh Waddell,2016-11-30,2016.0,11.0,,"A group of top senators is asking President Obama to release more information about Russia’s involvement in the election, hinting that important details are being kept secret. In a letter sent Tuesday and made public Wednesday, seven Democratic senators —  six members of the Senate Intelligence Committee and one member of the Senate Armed Services Committee —  wrote a   letter to the White House. It read, in its entirety: We believe there is additional information concerning the Russian Government and the U. S. election that should be declassified and released to the public. We are conveying specifics through classified channels. The letter was led by Ron Wyden, an outspoken Democratic senator from Oregon who has long been active on technology issues. The other five signatories from the Senate Intelligence Committee included Mark Warner, who will become the committee’s next  . But the list of names had a glaring omission: Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s current   was the only Democratic committee member who didn’t sign the letter. Just yesterday, the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, Elijah Cummings, called for an investigation of Russia’s role in the U. S. election. Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, said she was in support of the investigation. The claim that Russia attempted to meddle in the election has the weight of the intelligence community behind it. In October, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security announced that they were “confident” that the Russian government was behind intrusions into “U. S. political organizations,” likely referring to data breaches at the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Now that the election is over, it’s not clear what effect the release of concrete details about Russia’s involvement would have."
60136,82287,Why Trump and the Tech Industry Are on a Collision Course,Atlantic,Ronald Brownstein,2016-12-14,2016.0,12.0,,"The political gulf between Donald Trump and the   community he has summoned to a meeting in New York City on Wednesday might be comparable to the technological distance between the latest   smartphone and a Commodore 64 personal computer. While Hillary Clinton, by most accounts, did not stir up as much enthusiasm as President Obama did among this group, the resistance to Trump across the technology industry was widespread and powerful —  whether measured by votes, campaign contributions, or endorsements. The list of   notables who endorsed Trump essentially began and ended with Peter Thiel, the PayPal   and libertarian investor who also bankrolled the lawsuit from wrestler Hulk Hogan that bankrupted Gawker Media. Democrats: Trump Must Divest From His Hotel or Breach His Lease, The barriers between Trump and the technology world span both values —  the industry emphatically leans left on social issues —  and interests. Trump’s hostility to immigration, opposition to free trade, and resistance to replacing fossil fuels with renewable sources to combat climate change all clash directly with the constellation of technology industries that rely on importing talent from around the world, sell their products across the globe, and have invested heavily in developing   alternatives to oil, gas, and coal. Tech leaders are also bracing for Trump to attempt to unravel the   rules that Obama’s Federal Communications Commission adopted, and to push against the privacy standards many industry leaders have sought to maintain. During the campaign, Trump in turn lashed Apple for manufacturing too many of its products overseas. Stephen Bannon, the former chief executive of Breitbart —  who has emerged as the ideological synthesizer of Trump’s worldview —  has touted Democrats’ courtship of the technology industry as evidence the party had abandoned heartland workers for coastal elites. As Bannon recently told The Hollywood Reporter, “They were talking to these people with companies with a $9 billion market cap employing nine people. It’s not reality. They lost sight of what the world is about. ” Trump and most leaders in the tech community start from an inimical view of what makes the economy prosper. While Trump presents the economy essentially as a   competition —  with immigrants and foreign trading competitors in effect taking opportunities from   Americans —  the tech industry’s dominant view is that more openness to ideas, people, products, and markets ultimately creates a widening circle of growth. The technology giants face their own questions about inclusion of racial minorities and women, and whether, as Bannon questioned, their   products are generating good jobs for the many or just wealth for a few. But they are virtually united in believing that Trump is trying to restore an economic order that is irretrievably past. Trump “holds a totally antithetical worldview to most people there,” said a political operative who works closely with technology companies and who asked not to be identified. “That’s not to say he is entirely wrong and they are entirely right. But he is the personification of the mythical past. Basically from 1947 until 1965, during that period of time, things were pretty sweet if you were a white, straight,    guy.   …     It felt dominant and it was. But [among technology leaders] there is a very strong belief that we are not going back to the economy the way it was. There is definitely a belief that is not going to happen, and that it is not going to look and feel like it did. ” Across this DMZ of mutual suspicion, financial support for Trump from the technology industry barely registered as trace amounts. The industry is usually thought of as leaning left, but even compared with Mitt Romney’s fundraising among techies in 2012, Trump’s cratered. The Center for Responsive Politics, on its authoritative OpenSecrets. org website, tracks contributions from individuals and political action committees from all major industry sectors. Among the companies the Center includes in the Internet sector —  firms like Google, Facebook, and Amazon —  Clinton and the super PACs supporting her outraised Trump and his affiliated PACs through  . Clinton’s haul was far greater: $5. 6 million compared with just $54, 472 for Trump. (Final figures through Election Day aren’t available yet.) That’s an advantage of nearly 103 to 1. Four years ago, Obama’s advantage over Romney among these firms was much more modest, at just under 3 to 1. In the Center’s larger grouping of firms involved in electronics manufacturing and equipment —  companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Cisco, and Oracle —  Clinton outraised Trump by about 22 to 1: $10. 7 million to $483, 313. In 2012, the Center’s figures show, Romney and his affiliated PACs actually outraised Obama and his allies among these firms, $8. 6 million to $8. 3 million. That means even Romney outraised Trump from these companies by nearly 18 to 1. Individuals from firms identified in the   industry gave the Clinton campaign about $1. 1 million —  and Trump less than $46, 000. Romney, a former investor himself at Bain Capital, also outraised Obama among venture capitalists. The striking things about these numbers is not the level of support for Clinton very few technology executives made the massive personal donations to political action committees supporting her that she received from wealthy executives and entrepreneurs in some other sectors. Instead, the notable point is the minuscule support for Trump, who not only faced policy conflicts with tech leaders, but was also hampered by his almost complete lack of personal relationships with them. Among both the internet and electronics manufacturing and equipment firms, Trump was significantly outraised not only by Clinton, but also by Republican primary rivals Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, and Jeb Bush —  all of whom obviously stopped collecting money long before Trump did. In the increasingly dispersed geographic clusters of technology manufacturing and digital design, the voting results were nearly as lopsided. Looking at the results by county, Clinton won about   of the vote in San Francisco and Kings County (Brooklyn) about   in San Mateo (Silicon Valley) and Denver and just under   in Suffolk (Boston) Multnomah (Portland) Santa Clara (Silicon Valley) and King (Seattle). She won almost exactly   of the vote in Travis County (Austin). One of few emerging technology nodes that Trump carried was Maricopa County (Phoenix) where the staunchly conservative and older eastern suburbs tipped the balance. An analysis of the election results by metropolitan area —  rather than by county —  that was conducted by my colleague Richard Florida and his associates at the Martin Prosperity Institute adds to the picture. Florida and his colleagues found that in a regression analysis designed to isolate the impact of different social and economic factors on the results, “Clinton support was   …     much greater in metros with larger concentrations of     investment, and   industry, while Trump votes were negatively correlated with each. These correlations are all stronger for 2016 than they were in 2012. ” In fact, subsequent analysis by Florida and his associates, conducted for The Atlantic, found that Clinton carried 18 of the 20 metropolitan areas with the highest amount of   investment. The only exceptions were the Dallas and Houston metro areas —  though in each case Clinton comfortably won the county directly centered on the city itself. The 18   metropolitan areas that Clinton carried —  a list topped by San Francisco San Jose Boston New York Los Angeles Washington, D. C. San Diego and Seattle —  collectively account for over 85 percent of the nation’s total   investment. In all these ways, the   industries accustomed to thinking of themselves as visionaries shaping an increasingly digital, globalized, and green economic future expressed their resistance to Trump —  a presidential candidate who, in his pledge to “make America great again,” chose as his model a   century economy that relied more on manufacturing and   extraction, and less on immigrants and imports, than today’s economy does. Trump, for his part, may see the socially liberal,   tech community as an ideal foil: a prominent industry he can confront for his   largely   base with very little risk, because he has so little support in it to lose. Wednesday’s meeting will offer the first indication of how these clashing perspectives will converge —  or, more likely, collide —  over the next four years.

60755,83083,Official: Top Clinton aides also handled ‘top secret’ intel on server,Fox News,Catherine Herridge,2016-02-11,2016.0,2.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160211081742/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/11/official-top-clinton-aides-also-handled-top-secret-intel-on-server.html
"," EXCLUSIVE: At least a dozen email accounts handled the “top secret” intelligence that was found on Hillary Clinton’s server and recently deemed too damaging for national security to release, a U. S. government official close to the review told Fox News.   The official said the accounts include not only Clinton’s but those of top aides  —   including Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, Jake Sullivan and Philippe Reines  —   as well as State Department Under Secretary for Management Patrick F. Kennedy and others.  There is no public evidence they were authorized to receive the intelligence some of which was beyond Top Secret. A second source not authorized to speak on the record said the number of accounts involved could be as high as 30 and reflects how the intelligence was broadly shared, replied to, and copied to individuals using the unsecured server.  “My contacts with former colleagues and current active duty personnel involved in sensitive programs reveal a universal feeling that the HRC issue is more serious than the general public realizes,”  Dan Maguire,  a former strategic  planner with Africom, and with 46 years combined service, told Fox.  “Most opine they would already be behind bars if they had apparently compromised sensitive information as reported. ” Without access to the actual   Maguire said it was hard to ascertain what damage might have been done by the disclosure of human spying intelligence and secret material.  “Either way, the intelligence community is undoubtedly conducting damage assessments and evaluating the viability of any ongoing operation that may have been exposed to unauthorized personnel. The vulnerability of HRC’s server to foreign government hacking cannot be overlooked   even the DCI, John Brennan, has been the target of hackers,” he said. Former U. S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey told Fox, “It is counterintuitive to suggest that they (Clinton’s aides) all had authorization and access through a   server to information of that sensitivity. ”   The State Department recently confirmed that the messages in question include the most sensitive kind of intelligence. On Jan. 29, Fox News first reported that some emails on Clinton’s server were too damaging to release in any form. The State Department subsequently announced that 22 “top secret” emails were being withheld in full these were the messages being handled by more than a dozen accounts. Pressed on whether a damage assessment was being done, State Department Spokesman Mark Toner said, “To your broader question  —   what is being done to    as you said spillage  —   I can’t speak to those efforts today. We’re aware obviously of those concerns.  We are taking steps, but I don’t have any more details to provide. ” Aside from this week’s letter confirming the FBI investigation is focused on Clinton’s server, the Bureau has not publicly acknowledged whom it has contracted or interviewed.  Kennedy recently told the House Benghazi Select Committee that he knew about Clinton’s personal email from the beginning, but did not understand the ”scope” of its use for Clinton’s government business.    Kennedy’s testimony now appears to conflict with emails released through the Freedom of Information Act that show he routinely sent and received government business from the Clintonemail. com account. Toner said Kennedy learned about Clinton’s arrangement later. “He did not have knowledge of the computer server that she had set up [for] personal email or computer server she’d set up at her residence,” he said. However, on the official State Department website, Patrick F. Kennedy’s biography says that he has worked for the department since 1993 and, in his current position as Under Secretary for Management,  he is responsible for the “people, resources, budget, facilities, technology, financial operations, consular affairs, logistics, contracting, and security for Department of State operations. ”  Catherine Herridge is an   Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.

"," Hillary Clinton is facing Republican criticism for seeming to take a sharper tone on terrorism as she leaves the primary race behind  —   not only in her willingness to invoke the term “radical Islamism,” but her calls for a more aggressive   campaign and her criticism of Gulf allies. Republicans specifically pointed to the contrast between her    strategy detailed Monday and her stance just six months earlier during a primary debate in New Hampshire.  At that forum, she voiced utmost confidence in the Obama administration’s approach for confronting ISIS and pursuing political transition in Syria.   “We now finally are where we need to be,” she said at the time. “We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS which is a danger to us as well as the region, and we finally have a U. N. Security Council resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria. ” On Monday in Cleveland, however, she said while the Obama administration’s coalition effort in Syria and Iraq has made gains, more needs to be done to combat the growing threat around the world. “As ISIS loses actual ground in Iraq and Syria, it will seek to stage more attacks and gain stronger footholds wherever it can, from Afghanistan, to Libya, to Europe,” Clinton said. “The threat is metastasizing. ” The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage → She also called for an “intelligence surge,” along with renewed efforts to work “  ” with allies to dismantle networks that move money and fighters. She added, “Here at home, we must harden our own defenses. ” On another front, Clinton took a firm line on Gulf allies, saying “it is long past time for the Saudis, the Qataris and the Kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations. And they should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path towards extremism. ” Presumptive Republican rival Donald Trump fired back, noting her family foundation’s ties with those same allies runs deep. Saudi Arabia reportedly has donated millions to the foundation. Trump said on Facebook: “Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation want women as slaves and to kill gays. Hillary must return all money from such countries!” Meanwhile, Clinton also responded Monday to Trump’s criticism that she doesn’t use the term “radical Islam”  —   by openly addressing the religious factor.   “To me, radical jihadism, radical Islamism, they mean the same thing. I’m happy to say either but that’s not the point,” Clinton told NBC News. Trump later claimed credit for Clinton using that terminology  —   but contrasted it against the language she used during the primary campaign last year. During Monday’s speech, he read aloud part of a November 2015 tweet from Clinton that said: “Let’s be clear: Islam is not our adversary. Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing to do whatsoever with terrorism. ” Trump said Monday, “Hillary Clinton, for months, and despite so many attacks, has repeatedly refused to even say the words ‘radical Islam. ’” The dynamics for Trump have not changed as much as they have for Clinton as the candidates shift from primary to general election. On the Democratic side, the former secretary of state spent much of the primary race battling allegations from her left flank that she took too hawkish a view toward foreign intervention while in the Obama administration. In the December debate, she was responding to criticism from   Martin O’Malley about “traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy. ” Now, Clinton turns to the general election trying  —   like Trump  —   to assure the country that her administration would be tough on the terror threat. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest on Monday denied that there was any daylight between Clinton and Obama in how they now describe the threat. “She is somebody who agrees strongly with the president’s approach to ensuring that we are not giving legitimacy to a terrorist organization that would love to advance the narrative that they are somehow holy warriors advancing the cause of Islam by waging war against the United States. That is an utterly baseless myth,” he said. He later added, “I am confident that she agrees 100 percent with the president’s approach to fighting ISIL and strongly supporting this goal of making clear that Muslims in the United States should not be stigmatized or marginalized. ”   "

"," It is remarkable that Abraham Lincoln never delivered a Fourth of July speech. The closest he came was on July 10, 1858, in Chicago during one of the famous   debates, when Lincoln spoke of the Founders as “iron men. ” He remarked how, every July 4, Americans celebrate those “iron men” and their extraordinary achievement, because we are “historically connected” with it. Lincoln meant this literally. He was speaking to those who were old enough to remember the Founders from their youth and those descendants of the Revolutionary generation. But then Lincoln spoke about another set of Americans, the ones whose families came here after the great Revolution was over. In a word, immigrants. Of these, Lincoln said: “If they look back through this history and trace their connection with those days by blood, they find they have none. They cannot carry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us, but when they look through that old Declaration of Independence, they find that those old men say that, ‘We hold these truths to be   that all men are created equal,’ and then they feel that the moral sentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men, that it is the father of all moral principle in them, and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh, of the men who wrote that Declaration, and so they are. ” And so we are. None of us fought at Bunker Hill or Lexington or Concord. None of us endured famine, cold, or the impact of a musket ball. None of us signed our names to a document that made us traitors, fit to be hung. Yet, despite all that, we are still Americans, and the Fourth is still our celebration, because we hold dear the “moral sentiment” for which those iron men fought and died  —   “That all men are created equal. ” Lincoln would fight and die for it, too. Lincoln reassures us that this alone is enough to form that “historical connection” with men who in all other things bear no relation to us. Or, as he puts it: “That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and   men together, that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world. ” As this speech was delivered in response to Stephen Douglas, a congressman from Illinois, Lincoln connects the “electric cord” in the Declaration with the question of slavery. “If one man says [the Declaration] does not mean a negro, why not another say it does not mean some other man?” In a few short paragraphs, Lincoln eviscerates Douglas’ contention that the ideals of the Declaration were reserved for only the true descendants of the American Revolution. It is remarkable that there was a time when Lincoln’s idea, now so central to our American mindset, was not dominant. And yet we find our present culture riven by a hypersensitive strain of identity politics. We are told, even by some who belong to Lincoln’s party, that we should provide this group of Americans with one kind of government handout and that group with another. We are told that we must “speak to” a certain group of Americans in a certain way or else lose their vote. We are told that skin color or sex  determines whether a group is more or less deserving of government perks. If one disagrees, one is shouted down as a racist, bigot, or chauvinist. Yet Lincoln would disagree. The Founders would disagree as well. And so must all whose connection with that great and glorious generation of “iron men” consists of embracing an ideal that was meant to be taken literally namely, that all men are created equal. But it is not enough to believe this. We must do more than reread those words this Fourth of July in between the barbeques and fireworks. We must do what the Founders did, and what Lincoln did in his own time, and fight against the insidious notion that those words mean other than what they say. Lincoln believed the Founders asked this of him and his generation. It is what the Founders ask of us still.

","Biles added a third gold medal to her rapidly rising haul on Sunday, easily capturing the women’s vault final. The    helped the ”Final Five” to team gold and also dominated the   competition last week, averaged 15. 966 on her two vaults on Sunday to become the first American woman to win the event at the Olympics. Minutes after Biles picked up the first vault gold medal ever by an American female gymnast, British star Max Whitlock earned his second gold of the day  —   and the second ever for his country in gymnastics  —   when he won the pommel horse to back up his victory earlier in the afternoon on floor exercise. While the day may belong to Whitlock, the games belong to Biles. Her score was more than .7 better than silver medalist Maria Paseka and bronze medalist Giulia Steingruber of Switzerland, showcasing the gap between Biles and the rest of the world. Going last among the eight female finalists, Biles drilled her Amanar  —   a round off onto the block followed by 2 ½ twists  —   and put up a 15. 9 to take the lead. Needing only to land her second vault to win, Biles was near perfect. Her score of 16. 033 for her ”Cheng” was the best of the night. Biles’ three golds in Rio are also the most by a female gymnast from the U. S. in one Olympics. The gold also gives Biles 17 world championship or Olympic medals, the most ever by an American woman. She will get a chance to stand atop the podium again when she competes in the balance beam finals on Monday and the floor exercise final on Tuesday. India’s Dipa Karmakar made history by being the first female gymnast from her country to compete in the Olympics and make an event final by finishing fourth. Oksana Chusovitina’s seventh trip to the Olympics ended with a   finish for the    from Uzbekistan. Chusovitina said afterward she’s already planning to train all the way to the 2020 games in Tokyo. Whitlock became the first gymnast from Great Britain to win Olympic gold by edging Brazil’s Diego Hypolito in the men’s floor exercise final. Whitlock’s score of 15. 633 was just enough to edge Hypolito, who finished with a 15. 533. Arthur Mariano of Brazil earned bronze for the host country. American Sam Mikulak finished eighth, his routine disrupted by an explosion from the rowdy crowd inside Rio Olympic Arena, which burst into applause when Mikulak  —   going last  —   made a mistake to assure the Brazilians of two medals. Mikulak said he ”got pretty rattled” by the noise. The Americans did receive a jolt of good news for the U. S. men’s program, which finished fifth in the team competition and failed to pick up a medal in the   last week, when Alex Naddour picked up bronze on pommels behind Whitlock and rival and teammate Louis Smith. Surprisingly, the Americans’ spot in the mix at the top has been taken by the Brits, who have revamped their program in recent years, winning a team bronze in London four years ago.

","Represented by the Pennsylvania branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, the six refugees sued Lancaster schools in federal court, saying they were dumped in a disciplinary school and are being denied access to a quality education. The students range in age from 17 to 21, and hail from Somalia, Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and Burma. “[The] Plaintiffs are refugees who have fled war, violence, and persecution from their native countries,” reads a statement from the lawsuit. “Having finally escaped their turbulent environment to resettle in America, these young immigrants yearn to learn English and get an education so they can make a life for themselves. ” The refugees hoped to enter McCaskey High School, known for its superior academic program, but instead were sent to Phoenix Academy, an alternative high school for “underachieving” students in the district. Phoenix students are subject to   banned from bringing personal belongings like watches and jewelry and forced to wear colored shirts that “correspond with behavior. ” U. S. News and World Report’s 2016 rankings show Phoenix Academy has a graduation rate of 54 percent, and its 458 students perform substantially below the state average on standardized tests. More than 90 percent of the students come from poor families, and there are just 11   teachers at the school, according to the magazine. “Our clients have already experienced much trauma and loss before arriving in this country,” Reggie Shuford, executive director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania, said in a statement. “Rather than helping them make the difficult adjustment by providing educational resources required by law, the school district has denied them an education completely or forced them into an alternative school, where they are often bullied and don’t learn. ” Officials for the school district say the six students were sent to Phoenix for a special program geared towards their needs. “[The District] believes the lawsuit is without merit,” Superintendent Damaris Rau said in a statement. ”We are confident we are doing an excellent job supporting our refugee students who often come to school with little or no education. ” A special ”acceleration program” at Phoenix was created for   students, both refugee and   which gives them the opportunity to earn credits toward a high school diploma by the age of 21, Rau said.   At Phoenix, the students receive various services including remedial services, English classes for Second Language Learners, after school programs, job and computer skills as well as mentoring services, Rau added. Earlier this week, some of the students testified about their educational experience in an Eastern District of Pennsylvania courtroom. Khadidja Issa, who arrived in America from Chad with her family by way of their home country Sudan, said on Tuesday school officials told her she “was too old for school” and should get a job instead. “I responded that I didn’t want a job without an education,” she said. Issa, who lived in a refugee camp from the age of 5 to 17, also said that she found the search procedure invasive while attending the school. “I have been to school before and I’ve never seen a place where they pat you down in order to enter school, and they do it every day,” she said."

","After Trump issued a series of tweets early Tuesday morning during which he called the Times a ”failing” paper and cancelled the meeting, Trump and the Times appeared to reach some sort of détente by late morning, when Trump tweeted ”The meeting with the @nytimes is back on at 12:30 today. Look forward to it!” Trump met with several Times reporters and columnists as well as the paper’s top brass, touching on topics from climate change to whether he favored a further criminal investigation of his general election opponent, Hillary Clinton. During the campaign, Trump had repeatedly said he would consider appointing a special prosecutor to look into alleged misdeeds of the Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s use of a private email server. ”My inclination would be for whatever power I have on the matter is to say let’s go forward. This has been looked at for so long, ad nauseum,” Trump said, according to a series of tweets from a Times reporter who was in the room. Trump also discussed putting    adviser and real estate developer Jared Kushner in charge of a hypothetical Middle East peace negotiation, and he defended embattled chief strategist Steve Bannon. Bannon has been under fire for days by those who claim he represents or encourages the   ” ” or ”White Nationalist” movements. ”If I thought he was a racist or   or any of the things, the terms we could use, I wouldn’t even think about hiring him,” Trump said.

I cancelled today’s meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice, ”It’s not a group I want to energize,” Trump said of the fringe groups. ”And if they are energized I want to look into it and find out why.” Trump also said he believed ”there is some connectivity” between humans and climate change and said he was keeping an ”open mind” on the topic    a stance that puts him at odds with many of the Republican voters who cast ballots for him just two weeks ago. TRUMP WON’T PURSUE CHARGES AGAINST CLINTON, AIDE SAYS, The respectful interview marked a stark contrast from the earlier    during which Trump and the Times issued dueling statements  —   Trump on Twitter, the Times in an article  —   regarding who was to blame for the breakdown of the initial sitdown. It was the latest salvo in a war of words that’s raged between the two titans since Trump declared his candidacy for president in June 2015. “I cancelled today’s meetings with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice,” Trump tweeted at 6:16 a. m. He continued in another tweet: “Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes. In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!” Eileen Murphy, the senior vice president of corporate communications for the Times, said Trump’s tweets were the newspaper’s first indication that the meeting had been canceled. She also disputed Trump’s version of events. “We did not change the ground rules at all and made no attempt to,” Murphy said in a statement issued in an article on the company’s website. “They tried to yesterday  —   asking for only a private meeting and no    segment, which we refused to agree to. In the end, we concluded with them that we would go back to the original plan of a small    session and a larger    session with reporters and columnists. ” The session with the Times followed a reportedly contentious  —   and totally     —   Monday meeting with representatives and anchors of the major television networks. Fox was included in that meeting. It was also the first time Trump and a representative for the Times had spoken since a Sunday piece by the Times’ public editor, Liz Spayd, excoriated the paper’s coverage of the election. Spayd wrote the paper had received one of the largest influx of letters to the editor since the   terror attacks. And readers were not complimentary of the Old Gray Lady. “The number of complaints coming into the public editor’s office is five times the normal level, and the pace has only just recently tapered off,” Spayd wrote. “  …    Many people are commenting on the election, but many are venting about The Times’ coverage. ” Spayd did not reply to requests for comment from FoxNews. com on Monday or Tuesday. After he railed against the Times’ allegedly changing the terms of Tuesday morning’s meeting, Trump sent a tweet alluding to the public editor’s article. “The failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. I can fully understand that  —   but why announce?” Trump tweeted. Ahead of Trump’s meeting with the paper, the Times also issued a blistering editorial on Tuesday, claiming a “tide of racism,   and xenophobia” had “swept the country since the election of Donald Trump, whose campaign stoked these views  …    ” Fox News’ Serafin Gomez contributed to this report.

","President Barack Obama surprised an emotional Joe Biden Thursday with a farewell tribute where he presented the vice president with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Obama gave the entire Biden clan a glowing tribute, including his children, grandchildren and wife, Jill Biden. He described Biden and Jill as ”an   love story” and affectionately called Biden his ”brother” and a ”lion of American history.” Biden laughed and clapped along with the President’s remarks and reacted with shock when Obama ended his speech by giving Biden the medal.  ”To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretense, service without   and to live life fully,” Obama said. ”As one of his   colleagues in the senate who happened to be a Republican once said, ’if you can’t admire Joe Biden as a person, you have got a problem.’ He is as good a man as God ever created.” Obama said that he added an additional level of veneration to the medal for the first time in his presidency. The last three presidents awarded this level to Pope John Paul II, former President Ronald Reagan and General Colin Powell, Obama said. After the President awarded him the medal, Biden gave an emotional speech that he started in true form: with a joke, ribbing his chief of staff Steve Ricchetti for misleading him to get him to the surprise event. ”Steve Ricchetti, you’re fired,” he laughed. ”I had —  I had no inkling,” Biden continued. ”I thought we were coming over, Michelle, for you Jill, Barack and I to  —   and a couple senior staff to toast one another and say what an incredible journey it’s been.” Watch below:  "

","Four Republicans senators hailing from states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act fired a shot across the bow    in the form of a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( )    against the changes to the program that were included in draft House Obamacare repeal legislation. ”While we support efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and make structural reforms to the Medicaid program, we are concerned that the February 10th draft proposal from the House of Representatives does not provide stability and certainty for individuals and families in Medicaid expansion programs or the necessary flexibility for states,” the letter, signed by Sens. Rob Portman ( ) Shelley Moore Capito ( ) Cory Gardner ( ) and Lisa Murkowski ( ) said. If Republicans lose three votes in the Senate, their Obamacare repeal bill is doomed. There are 20 Republican senators representing Medicaid expansion states, and how to handle the issue has become a flashpoint in the Obamacare repeal debate.  GOP lawmakers have floated freezing enrollment on the expanded Medicaid programs before winding them down. The Feb. 10 draft bill would scale back the expansion in 2020, allowing the states to continue covering their expanded populations but with far less funding to do so from the federal government. More generally, Republicans are seeking to transform the Medicaid program into a block grant, meaning the states would get a lump sum instead of a match rate that allows the funding to adjust according to the program’s costs. States would be allowed to accept the block grant on per capita basis, meaning that the sum would be determined per person and would rise if more people enrolled. Even still, a per capita cap would result in $584 billion in cuts in federal funding for the program over 10 years, according to a slide show by health care policy experts presented to governors last month. GOP leaders have stressed that the Feb. 10 draft was a work in progress and that they were considering other changes. However, they have held more recent drafts under lock and key, with the intention of unveiling the final bill this week. Reports Monday sourced to those who have seen more recent forms of the legislation suggest some changes have been made, but it’s unclear what adjustments have been considered on the Medicaid proposals. Republicans have reportedly backed away from changing the way that   plans were treated in the tax code    which was framed as a crucial revenue booster for the bill’s Obamacare replacement elements    suggesting that major cuts to Medicaid will be needed to pay for the tax credits for individual insurance lawmakers are considering.

","White House staffer Ivanka Trump responded to critics Tuesday by saying she did not know what they meant when they said she was “complicit” in her father’s presidency. ”You hear the phrase ‘complicit’  —   that Jared and Ivanka are complicit in what is happening to the White House. Can you just weigh in how you feel about that?” CBS’ Gayle King asked Trump. “There have been articles, there have been parodies. What do you think about that accusation?”  “If being complicit is wanting to, is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact, then I’m complicit,” Trump said, using a definition that does not describe the word “complicit. ”  “I don’t know that the critics who may say that of me, if they found themselves in this very unique and unprecedented situation that I am now in, would do any differently than I am doing,” she continued. “So I hope to make a positive impact. I don’t know what it means to be complicit, but I hope time will prove that I have done a good job and much more importantly that my father’s administration is the success that I know it will be. ” Complicit, as King used it, refers to the criticism that Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, have failed to steady President Donald Trump’s tumultuous White House.  Kushner and Ivanka Trump were skiing in Aspen, Colorado, for example, when Trump offered conservative Republicans in Congress his support for removing Obamacare’s Essential Health Benefits during the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. Those EHBs include maternity care, the removal of which many assumed Ivanka Trump would lobby against, given her advocacy on issues like paid maternity leave and a tax deduction for child care expenses.

","BEIJING (AP)  —   The sister of President Donald Trump’s    Jared Kushner has been in China courting individual investors with a   federal visa program that provides a path toward obtaining U. S. green cards. Kushner’s sister Nicole Meyer promoted One Journal Square, a Kushner Companies’ development in Jersey City, at an event Sunday at the Four Seasons Hotel in Shanghai, according to participants. The pitch seeks to raise funds from Chinese investors through the U. S. government’s   visa program, which allows permanent U. S. residency for those who finance projects that create a certain amount of jobs. The event was organized by   immigration services company QWOS and Kushner Companies, according to an advertisement on the Chinese company’s website, which says the project is seeking $150 million from 300   investors. Kushner, a senior adviser to Trump, stepped down as chief executive of the Kushner Companies in January and has sold stakes in several properties to help allay concerns about conflict of interest. His family’s promotional efforts in China come amid widespread criticism of the   visa program, which has grown popular among wealthy foreigners seeking to move to the U. S. but faces allegations of fraud and misuse. Critics say many of the investments purportedly aimed at assisting poor areas of the U. S. have instead wound up going to projects in more affluent neighborhoods, while many programs have been badly hit by fraud scandals. U. S. lawmakers have been weighing proposed changes to the program, which would likely affect companies such as Kushner Cos. should it want to raise funds from such investors. Earlier this month, Congress extended the   program in its current form through Sept. 30. Staffers at QWOS’ offices in Beijing and Shanghai either refused to comment or did not answer repeated calls. The Kushner Companies declined comment. Blake Roberts, an attorney at the law firm of WilmerHale, which is Kushner’s personal counsel, said Kushner has no involvement in the operation of Kushner Companies. Roberts said in a statement that Kushner has divested his interests in the One Journal Square project by selling them to a family trust of which he, his wife and his children are not beneficiaries, a mechanism suggested by the Office of Government Ethics. “As previously stated, he will recuse from particular matters concerning the   visa program,” the statement said. Now led by Kushner’s relatives, the Kushner Companies had earlier been negotiating with China’s Anbang Insurance Group to provide what could be hundreds of millions of dollars in equity for redevelopment of a Manhattan office building. Those negotiations, which had drawn criticism from lawmakers and government ethics experts, ended in March. Critics saw it as a potential attempt by China to curry favor with the White House. The Chinese company’s advertisements for the Journal Square development described the project as “Kushner 1,” with punchy subtitles declaring that it has “government support” and is “founded by celebrity developers,” without elaborating. Bi Ting, a    woman who attended the Shanghai event, said having the name of the U. S. president’s    associated with it was “a bonus for the project. ” Bi said Kushner’s sister Meyer spoke for more than 10 minutes, describing the history of the Kushner family and the highlights of the project. Meyer spoke to the audience in English, aided by a translator, and didn’t take any questions, Bi said. The proposed   investment would account for around 15 percent of the total investment of $976 million required for the project. According to QWOS’s advertisements, the development comprises two   towers of 1, 476 luxury apartments, as well as commercial and retail space. Another person who attended the forum in Shanghai, who would only give her surname, Wang, said people in the conference said that Trump’s    was a shareholder of the Kushner Companies, but “he has already quit. ” “I don’t know if the connection with the president is good or not, it’s hard to say,” added Wang, who is from Shanghai. The other participant, Bi, who is pregnant, said she was considering immigrating to America to give her child an academic environment that is “more relaxing where one can pursue real interests and where the child can do something that they really want to do. ” Organizers prevented reporters from attending the event, saying it was a private function even though it is publicly advertised. On Saturday, Meyer spoke at a similar promotional conference in Beijing, details of which were first reported by the Washington Post and the New York Times. ___, Associated Press researchers Fu Ting in Shanghai and Henry Hou in Beijing contributed to this report.

The 2013 statistic, which is the most recent available, reveals that the relationship between the county’s approximately 7, 000 residents and the government is more complicated than standoff leader Ammon Bundy admits in front of television cameras.  According to a Times story on the sagging economy in Harney County, government jobs at prisons, schools and the very wildlife refuge occupied by Bundy and his brigade form the life blood of a community that once leaned more heavily on private industry. Today, the Times reports that 60 percent of the income in the county comes from ”the public sector.” The state of Delaware could fit four times comfortably in the sprawling lands that make up Harney County, which once leaned heavily on the timber industry for good paying jobs.

","ALBUQUERQUE, N. M. (AP)  —   An antiquities dealer who inspired tens of thousands to search the Rocky Mountains for $2 million in hidden treasure now leads an increasingly desperate mission to find one of his fans. Forrest Fenn has been flying out in chartered helicopters or planes, searching remote stretches of the upper Rio Grande for any sign of Randy Bilyeu, now missing in the wild for more than three frigid weeks. Fellow treasure hunters also are searching for Bilyeu, who was last seen on Jan. 5 while trying to solve Fenn’s mystery. ”Every time we go out and don’t find Randy it’s discouraging but we’re not going to give up,” Fenn told The Associated Press. ”There are still places out there that I want to look.” Fenn, an eccentric    from Santa Fe, has inspired a cult following since his announcement several years ago that he stashed a small bronze chest containing nearly $2 million in gold, jewelry and artifacts somewhere in the Rockies. He dropped clues to its whereabouts in a cryptic poem in his   memoir, ”The Thrill of the Chase.” The hidden treasure has inspired thousands to search in vain through remote corners of New Mexico, Yellowstone National Park and elsewhere in the mountains. Treasure hunters share their experiences on blogs and brainstorm about the clues. The mystery has been featured by national media, igniting even more interest. Fenn gets about 120 emails a day from people looking for his   box, and believes 65, 000 people have searched for the stash, some using family vacations to venture into the woods. ”The hope of finding the treasure is one thing, of course, but there’s a sense of adventure when you get out in the mountains and in the sunshine and the fresh air,” Fenn explained. ”One of my motives was to get the kids off the couch and away from the game machine.” But the search can be risky: Some have forded swollen creeks in Yellowstone and were rescued by rangers. A Texas woman spent a worrisome night in the New Mexico woods after being caught in the dark. Others have been cited for digging on public land, and federal managers have warned treasure hunters not to damage archaeological or biological resources. No ”Fenner” has been in a more dangerous a predicament than Bilyeu, a    grandfather who moved to Colorado two years ago to follow this dream. Family and friends say he bought a raft and set out on Jan. 5 after scouting for two weeks along the river west of Santa Fe. He had a GPS device, a wetsuit and waders, and brought along his little white dog, Leo. More than a week passed before a worried friend reached out to his   in Florida, Linda Bilyeu, who filed a missing person’s report on Jan. 14. His raft and dog were found the next day. Bilyeu left maps with markings in his car that fellow treasure hunters are using to narrow their search. He also left a sandwich, suggesting that he hadn’t planned to be gone long. The New Mexico Search and Rescue team and state police scanned canyons and mesas along the river by air and on foot, even bringing in dogs to sniff for clues, but suspended their efforts after several days. ”Unfortunately, we just don’t have anything to go on right now,” State Police spokeswoman Sgt. Elizabeth Armijo said. ”If someone were to find clothing or footprints or just something that might be indicative of the hiker, then we would have an area to go to. But we just have not found that yet.” The treasure hunters  —   led by Fenn  —   have not given up. ”We know that Randy studied this area very well. He even noted that certain areas were dangerous when the weather was bad and he had done quite a bit of research,” said Sacha Johnston, a treasure hunter helping to coordinate searches. ”He wasn’t just randomly kayaking down the Rio Grande one day. He knew where he was going. He had a plan.” Fenn never meant for his treasure hunt to be easy: His poem points searchers to somewhere beyond ”where warm waters halt . .. in the canyon down . .. too far to walk . .. below the home of Brown.” Getting out would be dicey as well, he wrote: ”. .. from there it’s no place for the   end is ever drawing  ’ll be no paddle up your   heavy loads and water high.” This was all supposed to be fun, of course. Now the search for Bilyeu is taking an emotional and physical toll on Fenn, who spends his days organizing, hiring aircraft, and worrying. His fans stand ready to admonish anyone who dares blame Fenn for Bilyeu’s disappearance, saying they’re all responsible adults. Fenn, for his part, has issued plenty of warnings, along with more clues. Among them: He says there’s no point to searching in winter, when snow would hide the treasure. He also said ”the treasure is hidden higher than 5, 000 feet above sea level,” but it isn’t buried, nor in a graveyard, ”nor associated with any structure.” And he has no plans to reveal its location. ”There have been too many people looking,” Fenn said. ”It would not be fair to them if we shut the thing down.” ___, Follow Susan Montoya Bryan on Twitter: "

","At a certain point you have to wonder what they did. Because at this point it seem like God is just f ’ing with the GOP. Like pulling wings off a fly. As you can see in the live election results data to the right, Ted Cruz looks like close to a lock to win the Kansas caucus. Only 25% of the precincts have reported so far. But he’s had roughly 50% of the tally consistently all the way so far. Unless the distribution of the returns is wildly uneven it’s hard to see how he doesn’t win. (So far no returns appear to be in from greater Kansas City metro region.) That will be Cruz’s fifth win so far. And it does not seem improbable at all that he could win at least one more. (Just as I typed this, the first 5% of precinct results came in from Maine. He’s winning there too.) GOP strategy to date has been to try to engineer the departure of enough candidate that sane Republicans are basically forced, compelled to vote for Marco Rubio. But it’s not happening. Another candidate may be picking up enough traction to give at least some level of a fight to Donald Trump. But it’s Ted Cruz! So maybe they’ll have to steal the nomination from both Trump and Cruz!

","I have a hard time remembering another political upset quite as big as Bernie Sanders totally unexpected victory last night over Hillary Clinton. Ironically, the best analogy I can remember is Hillary Clinton’s victory in New Hampshire over Barack Obama in 2008. To bring us back to that moment just over eight years ago: Barack Obama had just scored a not totally unexpected but still stunning victory over Clinton in Iowa. The New Hampshire polls swung heavily in Obama’s direction. It looked very much like Obama was about to all but knock Clinton out of the race. It was a string of days with immense drama and a mounting mood of poignance as Clinton soldiered on in the face of what seemed like the shattering end of her presidential ambitions. There was a much discussed moment on the trail over the final weekend where she teared up discussing why she was running for president. As I said, the New Hampshire campaign drew to a close in a climate of ecstatic expectation on the Obama side and a mix of funereal poignance and foreboding among Clintonites. Much like last night, the apparent losing campaign did not make much of an argument that the polls didn’t show the reality of the situation. Both, I think, expected to lose. And yet, in a totally unexpected reversal Clinton won   much, I suspect, to her own campaign’s surprise. There’s never been a totally adequate explanation of what happened. Were the polls simply wrong? Or did they miss a major shift in opinion in the last couple days over the weekend. In the pollsters’ defense, that was about as politically volatile a moment as you can imagine.  As we know, Clinton won and dramatically shifted the narrative of the campaign. She didn’t win in the end. But she changed what looked to be a quick knock out end to the 2008 campaign into a lengthy,    slugfest that was about as lengthy and intense as any primary battle we’ve seen in the modern presidential selection process era.  This win does not have those kinds of implications. Sanders would need to follow up with comparable victories in states like Illinois, Ohio or Florida to fundamentally shift the nature of the race. But this does force us to take a good look at the current polls in those states and see if there’s something not unique to Michigan which caused them to be so far off the actual result.

","For all the intensity and escalation of the last 72 hours, the biggest tell isn’t the canceled event in Chicago, the protestor rushing the stage in Dayton or the stunning announcement from Trump this morning that he wants to cover the legal bills of the supporter who sucker punched a protestor late last week in Fayetteville. The biggest tell is hiding there in plain sight and yet oddly out of view. Donald Trump realized that he needed to tamp down the heat of his campaign going into last week, not to forestall violence or do the right thing but for a very specific tactical reason. He is on the brink of securing the Republican nomination. But to have a nomination that is worth anything he needs at least the acquiescence of GOP party stakeholders. He told us as much. Thus the repeated calls to unity, the more sedate debate performance and even the rather bizarre invocations of the ’two Donald Trumps.’ But that’s not how it’s ended up. And it’s important to consider why. As I noted after last Thursday’s Republican debate, Trump was notably more subdued and (to use that comically nonsensical adjective) presidential, particularly toward his rivals and with regard to mainstream Republican issue touch points. But he was the same Trump on two issues   protestor beatings and Muslims. Last Saturday he was pressed for the first time in a high profile setting on the rally violence by CNN’s Jim Acosta. On Thursday the Fayetteville ’sucker punch’ video emerged, capturing in an escalated and more visually arresting form what has been simmering at his rallies for weeks. This generated a more defensive and aggressive stance from Trump which emerged simultaneous to the debate and after it. It also escalated what had been smatterings of Black Lives Matter protestors at event after event to the much larger and more organized protest we saw in Chicago when Trump took the fateful step of organizing a rally in a major city in a blue state at a racial diverse urban college campus.  In the 36 hours since the Chicago blow up we’ve seen the chilling incident in Dayton where an   protestor tried to rush the stage while Trump was speaking, Trump attacking ”communist” Bernie Sanders, equating his protestor opponents with ISIS terrorists and threatening to send his supporters to Sanders’ rallies if Sanders doesn’t stand down. (Needless to say there is no evidence whatsoever that Sanders is involved in organizing or encouraging any protests at all.) The most recent   is Trump telling Meet the Press this morning that he wants to pay the legal fees of the man who sucker punched the protestor in Fayetteville (and later said that killing might be necessary next time.) It may seem like I’m saying that Trump lit the fire but is now unable to put it out. But I’m not. It’s not that simple. What we can see now is that Trump can try to ’pivot to the general’. But the primaries will follow him there whether he wants them to or not. Trump saw the tactical need to shift gears, as many of his fair weather supporters and opponents expected he would. But the momentum of events proved stronger. At a deeper level still, the cycle of reaction, revanche and provocation seems to be operating within Trump himself.  Yesterday I noted this article in the Times which looked at the backstory to Trump’s presidential campaign. This wasn’t just Trump’s once a decade flirt with running for President, finally taking the plunge. It was a product of a half decade in the making quest to gain power and respect in the world of politics. According to the Times, Trump’s humiliation at the hands President Obama and Seth Myers at the White House Correspondents Association dinner in 2011 played a key role in galvanizing this drive for power and respect. There was the additional irony that this potent confrontation occurred only hours after Obama gave the final okay for the bin Laden compound raid and while he waited to hear the fate of that mission. Journalists look for defining moments and often   them. This isn’t a criticism I’m sure I do the same myself. We can’t know just what role that dinner roasting played. But the reference, along with the events of the last 72 hours, bring a more general pattern into focus. We’ve discussed before that Trump has crystallized and made himself the leader of the revanchist core of the contemporary GOP, a group of people who are overwhelmingly white, largely older and believe that their country and a range of social realities they cherished have been taken away from them. They want both back. Jamelle Bouie writes that ”white voters hope Trump will restore the racial hierarchy upended by Barack Obama.” I am not sure I would phrase it quite so starkly. But I’m also not sure why I wouldn’t. Race is at the core of what we are seeing unfold. Indeed, I’ve made similar arguments myself. What has only fully come into focus for me over the last week is that Trump is not only leading this but embodies it as well.  Trump was born very rich and ascended on his own to the level of the fantastically rich. He has achieved much but only known levels of privilege and entitlement few of us can imagine. And yet the early embrace of birtherism, the sting of the humiliation at Barack Obama’s hands, the palpable psychic energy he derives from ramping up a climate of racial confrontation all suggest he is animated, even driven, by the same rage at upended privilege and cultural and yes racial loss as his followers.  All of which is to say that it is not that Trump can’t control the beast he’s unleashed. He cannot control himself because the same psychodrama and politics of resentment that is playing out among his followers is playing out within himself. Trump can pivot to the general all he wants. But the primaries will follow him there. Indeed, he will bring them. Josh Marshall is editor and publisher of TalkingPointsMemo. com. "

","Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) on Monday brushed off Donald Trump’s threat to file a lawsuit over reports that Cruz may gain delegates won in the Louisiana primary by Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) who has since dropped out of the race. ”I’m always amused when Donald doesn’t know what to do and so threatens lawsuits,” Cruz said when asked about the potential lawsuit during a press conference in Wisconsin. ”Who cares? He can threaten whoever he likes,” the Texas senator continued. ”I think the American people are getting tired of it.” Cruz said that Trump does not know how to create jobs or keep America safe and ”instead he yells and screams and curses.” ”It’s all a bunch of noise,” he added. Following a report in the Wall Street Journal that the five delegates that had been awarded to Rubio in Louisiana would likely align with Cruz, Trump complained that Cruz was trying to ”steal delegates” in a primary the real estate mogul won. Trrump then suggested he would file a lawsuit in a tweet, although it’s unclear who specifically he would sue. During his Monday press conference, Cruz also addressed Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal’s (R) decision to veto a ”religious freedom” bill that civil rights groups characterized as  . Cruz said Deal’s decision was ”disappointing” and lamented that ”it wasn’t long ago that religious freedom enjoyed bipartisan support.” The Republican presidential candidate was also asked about calls for the Republican National Convention to allow attendees to carry guns. Cruz said that he hadn’t ”reviewed” a petition to allow convention attendees to openly carry firearms, noting that the Secret Service has ”the principal decision making concerning security.”  The Secret Service has said that firearms will not be allowed at the convention."

","It’s been a consistent feature of recent US presidential elections that they are less about persuasion than mobilization of relatively stable political coalitions. There is a thin segment of    voters but it tends to be as little as five percent and seldom more than ten percent of electorate, and only those in a handful of swing states really drive the campaigns’ attention. Because of this, the campaigns are largely talking past each and that is by design. But watching last night’s victory speeches I realized that this general election is likely to take that model to an entirely new level. As I mentioned in this post last night, on its own terms, speaking to his own audience, most of Trump’s speech and QA were very strong. He was brimming with confidence, on point. His message about bad trade deals and stagnating wages and NAFTA fit together like a nicely ordered package with strong appeal to the people who now actually make up the Republican coalition, as opposed to the people who did in the 1980s. The border wall, while mentioned, had receded to the background. It made me go back to what I started wondering months ago about whether Trump might have significantly more crossover appeal than people realize. Then he came back with the demeaning and crass attacks on Hillary as little more than a gender affirmative action candidate. ”Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don’t think she’d get 5% of the vote. The only thing she’s got going is the woman’s card.” When your top surrogate’s Republican wife visibly grimaces at your remark you know it’s bad news for a wide swath of the electorate. Trump can’t not be Trump, a point I want to return to. But for now I want to make a different point.  These two candidates aren’t just appealing to different demographics or voting coalitions. They’re operating in what almost amounts to two different political universes. In linguistic terms it is almost like two mutually unintelligible languages. I guarantee you that everyone who has voted for Trump in any primary so far loved those remarks. They hate Hillary. They hate ’political correctness’. More than anything else they love provocation itself. But this kind of talk, while a single instance itself, reminds us that Trump has already all but disqualified himself with huge swaths of the electorate. It’s like a long fingernail drag over the chalkboard for a significant majority of voters. Trump has a 70%+ disapproval rating among women roughly 80% disapproval among Hispanics and the list goes on and on. At the moment he’s even doing fairly poorly among whites! But we should expect those numbers to rise significantly as Republican partisans unify around Trump.  Meanwhile Clinton is talking about opportunity, inclusion across racial groups and the gender divide. It is a message framed around inclusion for rising groups, young people and incremental improvements in the safety net and wages for those just hanging on in the 21st century economy. It really amounts to a simple continuity message with the Obama presidency. What he did. My point isn’t to pump this agenda. This is an ideologically agnostic point. It is to point out how it is virtually incomprehensible in the Trump universe. Gibberish or nonsense in a worldview based on reclaiming things your supporters believe were or are being taken away from them by others, and a powerful leader reclaiming what you lost from domestic newcomers and foreign adversaries. They’re just categorically different, not just in policy terms, but in language, manner of acting in public, concept of leadership. Everything. They’re mutually incomprehensible, seemingly indifferent to what folks on the other side of the divide even think. Think about it this way. Can you imagine Trump and Clinton actually debating or discussing a specific issue? Let alone engaging in a formal debate? What worries Republicans profoundly and has Democrats what I would call cautiously ecstatic is that if both candidates are doubling down on these portions of the population   Clinton’s chunk looks significantly larger than Trump’s. The biggest driver in November may turn out to be gender. But seen through a racial prism, which seems more likely: that Trump will significantly drive up the white vote or that Clinton will significantly drive up the minority vote? Trump seems dramatically less popular with Hispanic voters than Romney and it is difficult to see him making up much of that ground. Remember too that there are fewer white voters in 2016 than there were in 2012.  One of the things Democrats often forget is that demographics only get you so far. They give advantages, sometimes profound advantages. But you still need a politics to win elections. Trump, though, is fencing himself into a demographic playing field that may for once make that important political wisdom meaningless. Unless you manage turnout levels of white men at significantly over 100% it is very hard to win a national election with just those voters if you make everyone else hate you.

70131,100090, Climate Scientists Are Worried Their Link To Weather Satellites May Be Choked Off,Buzzfeed News,Dino Grandoni,2017-02-16,2017.0,2.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170216010311/https://www.buzzfeed.com/dinograndoni/noaa-weather-spectrum
"," When cyclones barrel along the Pacific and tornadoes rage across the Midwest, satellites eye the tempests and send   weather data earthward. But the weather science community is worried they won’t always get those crucial views and other data, because of a proposed auction of one scientific band of the radio spectrum that’s under consideration by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Just a bit of radio interference can throw off calculations used to make accurate weather predictions that are “extremely sensitive” to even small temperature differences, said Jordan Gerth, a researcher at the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of  . “Even 2 or 3 degrees can be the difference between a rapidly growing thunderstorm and one that’s not going to pose a threat,” Gerth told BuzzFeed News. Right now, the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) system beams weather images and other information to terrestrial dishes  —   primarily, to those at a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) facility on Wallops Island in Virginia. Isolated off the state’s Eastern Shore, transmissions to the island usually go off without a hitch. But three times in 2015, portions of photographs of weather events  —   including Hurricane Patricia, the   intense tropical cyclone ever recorded  —   were blacked out. Interference in the electromagnetic spectrum  —   the invisible corridor by which everything from radio broadcasts, to cell phone calls, to television signals are delivered to devices through the US  —   was the culprit. “That interference was traced to a commercial operator in an adjacent band,” Mark Paese, deputy assistant administrator for satellite and information services at NOAA, told BuzzFeed News by email. Scientists studying climate change and other Earth systems rely on these eyes in the sky to do their work. But the community fears interference with satellite signals may get worse. That’s because a private company called Ligado Networks is seeking permission from the FCC  —   the federal agency responsible for allotting slices of spectrum  —   to share the band of radio frequencies that NOAA relies on to communicate with the GOES satellites. Right now, that band of spectrum acts as a buffer between Ligado’s existing network and channels NOAA uses to retransmit   satellite images and other data to weather centers around the country. Protecting those channels is crucial to the transmission of weather observations to not only NOAA itself, warn experts, but also to dozens of private firms and academic institutions, like the University of Wisconsin. “We need to be able to get the data in the timely matter,” Gerth said. But the company pushing the proposal argues that its plan, instead of interfering with the delivery of weather information, will actually help get that data to thousands of other scientists who currently don’t have access to it. Or, in the words of Reed Hundt, a former chairman of the FCC appointed by President Bill Clinton and a member of Ligado’s board of directors, “Ligado is going to democratize weather information. ” Ligado’s proposal stems back to 2010 when the Obama administration, in a push to increase internet access in the US, asked agencies to find 500 megahertz to share with private companies. When finished, the initiative would nearly double the amount of spectrum available to businesses. NOAA, scientists say, had done its part in response by giving up 50% of its spectrum in the 1670 —  1710 megahertz range, and redesigning its GOES satellite in the process. In November, NOAA put the latest satellite in the GOES series into orbit. That spacecraft is capable of sending back images with four times the resolution of other GOES satellites. “We did not push back on that,” Alexandra Shultz, director of public affairs at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) which represents Earth and space scientists in the US, told BuzzFeed News. “Until now, there hasn’t been something so crucial that we felt the need to actually protest. ” But Ligado’s proposal is for the FCC to auction off the rights to share the 1675 —  1680 megahertz range with NOAA. In addition to satellite images, the agency currently uses a channel at the edge of that band to relay data from thousands of stream gauges nationwide. Stream gauges, which measure the height of bodies of water in lakes and rivers across the country, are crucial to predicting floods and calling for evacuations. Ligado says it has a solution to the problem of interference: It proposes that whichever company wins the the bid for the spectrum band must black out its network around NOAA sites, including the one on Wallops Island, so that weather satellite signals can reach government dishes unimpeded. But those blackout zones do nothing for the 100 or so universities and private firms with their own dishes to collect satellite weather data. For that, the company says it has a novel solution: Build a portal on the Internet where anyone can see NOAA’s weather satellite data transmitted to Wallops Island and other protected ground stations. Plugged in online, not only can the institutions that currently use GOES data get access, but other places with small budgets, like startups and secondary schools, can use it too. “You never know who’s going to come up with what idea when they just have the data in their hands and they can play with it, like modeling clay,” Valerie Green, executive vice president and chief legal officer at Ligado, told BuzzFeed News. “If you open it up to more people, you’ll inevitably get more innovation and more science. ” Ligado has built a version of such a web portal and said its idea has received a warm reception among some scientists, including those at George Mason University, which received a grant from Ligado to test the prototype. “We anticipate that the data stream from Ligado will help us develop new tools to help students and scientists better understand weather,” Jim Kinter, director of the Center for    Studies at George Mason. But others in the Earth science community are skeptical of distributing the information online. “How do you ensure the quality of that data?” Shultz of AGU said. “How is it stored? How is it archived? Who has access to it? Who ensures continuity to it? Who ensures its security?” Ligado has attempted to make other inroads in the climate science community, sending representatives over the past eight months to two meetings of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) which represents weather, water, and climate scientists. But relations appear strained. In December, a joint letter from AMS and AGU to the Obama administration’s commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, accused Ligado of questioning “the Earth science community’s understanding of physics. ” “Such communications suggest that Ligado is dismissive of these issues and not a good faith partner in our effort to protect the nation’s severe weather forecasting capabilities,” wrote Keith Seitter and Christine McEntee, the executive directors of AMS and AGU respectively. It may be a while before the spectral scuffle is resolved. Ligado first submitted its proposal to the FCC, known for its lengthy deliberative processes, in 2012. In April of last year, the FCC issued a public notice about the proposal, asking scientists and others concerned to comment on it.

70161,100124," Betsy DeVos’s Brother, The Founder Of Blackwater, Is Setting Up A Private Army For China, Sources Say",Buzzfeed News,Aram Roston,2017-03-03,2017.0,3.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170303050355/https://www.buzzfeed.com/aramroston/betsy-devoss-brother-is-setting-up-a-private-army-for-china
"," Erik Prince  —   founder of the private military company Blackwater, financial backer of President Donald Trump, brother to the new Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and frequent Breitbart radio guest of White House power broker Stephen Bannon  —   has been offering his military expertise to support Chinese government objectives and setting up two   training camps in China, according to sources and his own company statements. The move could put him at odds with Trump, who has often taken a hard line against China, and could also risk violating US law, which prohibits the export of military services or equipment to China. Former associates of the    Prince told BuzzFeed News that the controversial businessman envisions using the bases to train and deploy an army of Chinese retired soldiers who can protect Chinese corporate and government strategic interests around the world, without having to involve the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. In December, Frontier Services Group, of which Prince is chairman, issued a press release that outlined plans to open “a forward operating base in China’s Yunnan province” and another in the troubled Xinjiang region, home to the mostly Muslim Uighur minority. “He’s been working very, very hard to get China to buy into a new Blackwater,” said one former associate. “He’s hell bent on reclaiming his position as the world’s preeminent private military provider. ” In an email to BuzzFeed News, a spokesperson for Frontier Services Group provided a statement and strongly disputed that the company was going to become a new Blackwater, insisting that all of its security services were unarmed and therefore not regulated. “FSG’s services do not involve armed personnel or training armed personnel. ” The training at the Chinese bases would “help   personnel provide close protection security, without the use of arms. ” “Mr. Prince and Mr. Trump know each other and share mutual respect,” the statement added. White House spokespersons did not respond to emails requesting comment for this story. Frontier Services Group trades on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and its largest shareholder is an investment fund owned and controlled by the People’s Republic of China, CITIC. Until last year Frontier claimed to be merely a logistics and transportation company, steering clear of Prince’s specialty of providing private military capabilities for operations  —   though last March The Intercept news organization ran a story saying that Prince, sometimes using his role at Frontier, was pitching security and paramilitary services. In the story, Frontier denied the company was involved. When Frontier later told its board it was shifting into security services  —   largely to assist China’s international development policy  —   the development disgusted two American executives at Prince’s Hong Kong company. Gregg Smith, the former CEO of Frontier, said he was ready to quit last March if Erik Prince was not removed from the company. Then, at a board meeting late that month, he said a company official made clear that Frontier would be providing security services in support of Chinese government objectives. “That was the final straw,” he told BuzzFeed News. Retired US Admiral William Fallon, a Frontier board member, was at the same board meeting. He resigned too when he heard that the firm was providing security services. “That wasn’t what I signed up for,” he said in an interview. President Donald Trump has talked tough about China. To be sure, he recently reaffirmed that the United States will formally recognize only mainland China and not Taiwan, a crucial point for Beijing. But Trump has installed a sharply   critic as the head of his National Trade Council. Before winning the presidency, Trump called China an “enemy. ” Trump adviser Stephen Bannon, who interviewed Prince on Breitbart frequently, predicted last year that the US will be at war with China “in the South China Sea in five to 10 years. ” And even if no hot war breaks out, many experts believe Trump is gearing up for a trade war with the country that manufactures much of the world’s goods (including some Trump brand products.) During the campaign, Prince donated $100, 000 to the Trump Victory Committee, which supported both Trump’s election bid and the Republican Party. Jeremy Scahill, a journalist who has long covered Prince, recently wrote that the businessman is advising the Trump Administration. Just four days before the election, Prince gave an interview to Breitbart radio, part of the media empire that Bannon used to run, in which Prince pushed an unfounded theory that the NYPD had been about to announce arrest warrants in the Clinton investigation but was blocked by the Justice Department, and that Hillary Clinton had been to a “sex island” with a convicted pedophile “at least six times. ” Prince’s bizarre claims were prominently displayed on Breitbart’s website leading up to the election and were widely distributed on right wing websites. Now, however, Prince’s new business foray could put him at odds with Trump. Former executives said that Frontier’s “forward operating bases” will be training former People’s Liberation Army soldiers to work as discreet   soldiers for hire. The former associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Prince “is making Frontier Services a   private military company. ” As of the summer, this person continued, “the plan was to set up   training facilities specifically to train the Chinese. ” Another former ally of Prince said: “The idea is to train former PLA soldiers in the art of being private military contractor. That way the actual Red Army doesn’t have to go into these remote areas. ” Asked about Frontier’s claim that Prince was planning “unarmed” security projects, both sources dismissed it, and emphasized that was not their understanding. It is “ridiculous,” said one. “Are they using sonic weapons,” joked the other. “Is it psychic powers?” Prince is best known as the founder of Blackwater, a private military company  —   Prince objects to the term “mercenary”  —   that did phenomenal business during the war on terror. The firm was frequently embroiled in scandal: Four of its employees were killed in Fallujah in 2004, leading to a Marine Corps onslaught on the city several former employees pleaded guilty to arms violations in a lengthy investigation and still others were convicted in a wild shooting spree in Baghdad in which 17 civilians were slaughtered. Typically, Prince has been involved in ventures that he claims are in line with US foreign policy goals. He has reportedly helped the United Arab Emirates set up a military unit of former Colombian soldiers pushed for an   operation in the Puntland region of Somalia and tried to sell a mercenary operation in Nigeria. The current China plan appears to be different. China is widely understood to have interests that are adversarial to the US, and the two powers compete for world influence. And US law bans US citizens from exporting   services or equipment to the country. Frontier’s December press release said the Yunnan base would “allow FSG to be able to better serve companies in Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia. ” The Uighur region, which would be home to the company’s second base, abuts Afghanistan. According to the press release “these bases will provide training, communications, risk mitigation, risk assessments, information gathering, medevac and joint operations centers that coordinate security, logistics and aviation. ” The press release said the company was “expanding its security offerings” to include “training for personnel,” as well as “Personnel Protection” services, which is industry jargon for providing bodyguards. The December press release did not state that the security offerings would be unarmed. Frontier’s expansion into China, its December press release said, was designed to help clients take advantage of China’s new development plan, “One Belt One Road,” a massive program that many experts believe aims to increase Chinese economic and political sway. China expert Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute said US regulators would likely take a dim view of security operations in China’s Uighur areas. “It’s at odds with the American government view that we don’t want to help the Chinese oppress the Uighurs in Xinjiang. ”  "

71134,102000, Tesla’s Valuation Could Overtake Ford Any Day Now,Buzzfeed News,Matthew Zeitlin,2017-03-29,2017.0,3.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170329195313/https://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/tesla-is-close-to-overtaking-ford-as-americas-second-most
","’Here’s the market valuation of Ford, in light blue, and Tesla, in black, over the last 12 months, up to the close of trading Tuesday’] Tesla, the   electric car company that sold about 84, 000 vehicles last year, is now worth about as much as Ford, which sold 6. 7 million cars in 2016 and turned a $4. 6 billion profit. Valuations for the two companies converged in recent months, as Ford slid and Tesla surged. By Wednesday afternoon, Tesla was worth $45. 2 billion and Ford’s was valued at $46. 6 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Tesla could overtake Ford any day now, and become America’s second most valuable car company. GM, the current number one, is worth about $54 billion. How wildly optimistic are investors about electric cars? Based on its current market price, Tesla is worth about $600, 000 per vehicle sold in 2016, while Ford is worth about $7, 000, according to calculations by Barclays analyst Brian Johnson. The stock market, of course, is supposed to reflect how investors rate the future of a company, not its past. On that front, Tesla, founded in 2003, has plenty of reasons for optimism. The company is right at the front of the two biggest trends in the industry: electric engines and   cars. And its revenues are heading up, fast: in 2016 it brought in $7 billion, up 73% on the year prior and up almost 1600% compared to four years ago. Ford’s revenue barely moved in 2016 and is up about 14% since 2012. Analysts expect Tesla’s revenues to keep surging as it releases more affordable models  —   their best guess is the company could sell $19 billion worth of cars in 2018, according to data collected by SP Global Market Intelligence. Ford, on the other hand, is expected by analysts to see its revenues fall slightly in the same period. Ford, like other major carmakers, is making sizable investments in   technology and electric vehicles, but none have captured the imagination like Tesla. Imagination or not, Ford is in good shape to benefit from lower gas prices, as buyers move away from sedans and towards Ford’s more profitable SUVs and trucks. But it’s easy to see why investors have a crush on Tesla. If the future of of transport involves a network of   electric cars, powered by batteries that charge with solar power, Tesla has set itself up to benefit from it. The company is rushing to build a giant battery factory, and now owns a major solar power business as well. Tesla stock has risen 22% in the last year, and 714% in the last five years. Ford shares, on the other hand, have fallen by 11% and 5% in the last 1 and 5 years respectively. Tesla also earned the endorsement of another massive technology company on Tuesday, when Tencent, the Chinese internet conglomerate that runs the social network WeChat, bought 5% of the company. Tencent is a “new adherent” of the “Tesla cult,” Johnson wrote. Some still have their doubts. Hedge fund manager Jim Chanos has long questioned Tesla’s business prospects, and those of its recently acquired solar energy business, Solar City, saying that the   car company would constantly have to take new money from shareholders to fund its losses. Johnson said in February that the jump in Tesla stock (the shares fell after the election and started rising again in December) had “less to do  …    with anything around the   financials, and more to do with the nearly superhero status of Elon Musk. ”  "
71484,102906, This Is What It’s Like When You Need To Leave Home And Can’t Afford The Rent,Buzzfeed News,Hannah Al-Othman,2017-04-08,2017.0,4.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170408165350/https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahalothman/this-is-what-its-like-when-you-need-to-leave-home-but-cant
"," Tens of thousands of young people could be put at risk of homelessness as a result of government changes to welfare payments to   leading charities have warned. From this month onwards young, single people aged between 18 and 21 will no longer automatically be entitled to claim housing benefit. The government said it made the change to avoid paying out money unnecessarily to those who are able to live at home with their parents. The policy applies to any future claims for universal credit, the single monthly payment that people who are entitled to government benefits receive, but will not affect those already in receipt of housing benefit. There are exceptions, such as for young people who are orphans, have children of their own, or have been in care  —   and the government says it will still pay out to those for whom it is “inappropriate” to live at home. The   exemption does not specify exactly what home circumstances would be deemed inappropriate, but housing charities said they fear that asking young people to go away and prove their situation may lead to them being turned down by private landlords and left with nowhere to live. A government spokeswoman said young people will not have to provide excessive evidence to prove their circumstances, but charities have expressed concerns that some of the most vulnerable  —   such as LGBT teenagers or young people who are being abused  —   may not want to disclose the reasons why they can no longer live at home. Homelessness charity Centrepoint has warned that the policy could put up to 9, 000 young people at risk of homelessness, while Welsh charity Llamau predicts that by 2020 as many as 11, 000 young people across the UK could be affected. Research from   University also suggests that if just 140 young people are made homeless by the policy, the resultant costs will wipe out any savings made on housing benefit. Frances Beecher, Llamau’s chief executive, told BuzzFeed News: “Most of my concerns are around the fact that this was done as a way of saving money without actually looking at the detail. “   there will be an increasing amount of young people made homeless or placed in dire circumstances as a result of this. “The government say they have all these exemptions, but the reality is that this is particularly discriminatory against      from disadvantaged backgrounds, those who don’t have the safety net that their   peers have. “They won’t have an automatic exemption to go and prove to a private landlord they will get housing benefit they will have to prove their exemption. Many landlords have difficulty accepting young people anyway, because of the difficulties of holding down jobs  —   young people can’t claim the same living wage as the rest of adulthood, they do exactly the same job, have the same level of responsibility. It seems ridiculous. ” Beecher said that many private landlords are reluctant to keep properties open while someone proves their housing benefit will be paid. She added: “The reality is you can have all those exemptions but you also have to have young people being savvy enough to fit the exemptions. Most of us love our families, we protect our families. Expecting a young person to say ‘My mum or my dad can’t cope’ or expecting them to disclose a level of abuse is difficult when all they know is they really don’t want to live at home. “[Politicians] are making the job harder all because we have a government blind to how many people live, and that situation is getting worse. We’re deliberately kicking a generation to the curb. ” The homelessness charity, which supports vulnerable women and young people across Wales, is urging the government to rethink the decision and has launched a petition to put pressure on  . BuzzFeed News spoke to five young people who explained why they left home in their teens and how having a financial safety net helped them to get back on their feet. Catherine Geddes, from Bradford in West Yorkshire, left home when she was 15 years old. She spent time on the streets, but with the support of youth homelessness charity Centrepoint, Geddes, now 23, was able to turn her life around and now lives independently. Speaking to BuzzFeed News, she said she believes the government has made the wrong decision in taking away automatic entitlement to housing benefit from     . “I was about 15 and my mum kicked me out because I had severe mental health problems. I had severe anorexia and bulimia, I would   lots, I was drinking a lot,” she said. “I had two younger siblings in the house, so she said I had to leave. I had years and years of bad relationships with my dad as well. “I was   for ages  —   I tried to go to the council but because I was that age they wanted to put me into care. I wasn’t happy with that, so I was a   I was street homeless for two weeks. ” Geddes, who eventually found a place and relied on government support to help her get by, said it is “not realistic at all” to expect all young people to live at home until they are 22. “No chance, absolutely no chance,” she said. “People I’ve met have been in such vulnerable situations, and if they can’t stay at home they won’t. Because of family breakdown, parents who are abusive  —   alcoholics, drugs addicts, lots of reasons. Once it gets to that point, you can’t live in your family home any more. ” Geddes said that proving their circumstances may be too much for some vulnerable young people who find themselves homeless. “It’s the most scary, unstable, horrible experience that people go through. It’s absolutely going to be detrimental. Already you’re very vulnerable, very, very upset  —   the added stress would have made my mental health problems worse. “It’s hard enough as it is, and there’s no way that people aren’t going to slip through the net and be picked up by all sorts of bad people. ” Geddes urged the government to rethink its decision and offer more support to young people: “We’re the future, and we deserve to be supported as much as anyone else from a more stable background. We’re still human beings and have feelings and emotions. “We’ve just fallen on hard times and need someone to pick us up and put us back on track again. ” John Morris was 15 years old and living in Cambridge when he was forced to leave home. He spent time on the streets, and slept on a friend’s sofa for a month before finding his own house, using housing benefit to help with his rental costs as he studied at sixth form college. Now 24, Morris lives in Nottingham and has a university degree and a good job in politics  —   but without housing benefit he thinks his life could have been very different. He told BuzzFeed News: “I have five siblings and we were split up by social services, but because I was 15 I was old enough to do what I wanted, so I went back to my mum because they couldn’t stop me. “She got increasingly worse mentally and kicked me out. I went to live with my uncle, who then kicked me out. I ended up on the streets but thankfully a friend’s family found me and put me up for a month. ” Morris said a charity called Stonham Housing helped him to find somewhere to live. “I lived there off housing benefit between 16 and 18 while I was at sixth form,” he said. “Without housing benefit I’d have been on the streets  —   there was no other option. I ultimately would have ended up on the streets I wouldn’t have got to university, I wouldn’t be working in politics. “It was a critical moment in my life  —   I was so close to going the other way. If I didn’t have that support from the government there’s no way I could have managed to make a better life for myself. ” Morris also urged the government to rethink the changes to the housing benefit system. “It should be the business of government to ensure young people thrive,” he said. “Removing a valuable asset for young people who are most vulnerable is a massive failure. People who need housing benefit at that age will have nowhere left to turn. ” Indigo Azidahaka, 19, is transgender and has not told their mother, who is very religious. Azidahaka left home at 16 and spent some time   before moving into supported accommodation. When they left to move into privately rented accommodation with friends their housing benefit was stopped as they had to make a fresh claim, and Azidahaka, a student and a musician, has since fallen into more than £1, 000 of debt. With a   college course to contend with, and suffering from mental health problems, Azidahaka had no way of clearing the debt, so their bandmates encouraged them to start a crowdfunding page to help pay off the arrears. Azidahaka told BuzzFeed News: “I was 16 when I left home. I had been living on and off with friends anyway. I had a very complicated relationship with my mother, and my dad died when I was 10 years old. “I’m not out to my mother  —   the reason for that is that she’s very religious. When I was growing up, if there was a lesbian couple on TV and they kissed, my mum would say ‘That’s disgusting’ and change the channel. I know for a fact that I couldn’t come out to her. “In the housing project that I lived in there were a ton of people who had to leave home because they were gay or because they were queer. “I don’t think it’s my mother’s fault that I had to leave she doesn’t really believe in mental illness, but she definitely does suffer mental illness. “It made living with her very difficult  —   emotional and physical abuse  —   and it got to a point where I just left because I couldn’t take it any more. We had one final argument and I left. “I ended up   and living with my boyfriend at the time who was also quite abusive, so that didn’t go great. ” Azidahaka moved to a housing project called The Foyer, in Manchester, and later moved out to live in a privately rented house in the city with two queer friends, who lent them the money for a deposit. “Now my housing benefit has been stopped and I’m in debt over £1, 000,” Azidahaka said, “and I will keep getting to debt until I get housing benefit again. I have no way of paying it off. “How is a    in   education meant to pay off this debt and afford a place to live? When they’re estranged from their parents, how are they supposed to live? “Housing benefit is essential, otherwise I don’t have a place to live. The government don’t care about young people, they don’t care about anyone who isn’t rich. They’re making it harder and harder for young people. “It’s making young people turn to drug dealing. I know people who have had to do sex work because they’ve not had any way out. That’s all they can do to keep themselves afloat. “It makes it harder to get a job too, if you’re queer too. Transphobia is a constant thing, it’s happening every day  —   I’ve been attacked in the street. Something needs to happen to stop that. And I have a personality disorder, BPD, which comes with a lot of horrible stigma. “My friends have had to talk me out of harming myself in the past. It’s such a horrible feeling that you can’t support yourself, that you have to rely on other people. ” Lauren Paterson, now 27, moved into hostel accommodation in her hometown of Burnley, Lancashire, when she was 15 years old, as she was not getting on with her mum and felt she could not stay at home. After a battle between the Department for Work and Pensions and social services over who would provide for her, she was allowed to live independently. Paterson managed to get her own place and survived on just £45 per week in housing benefit. She later moved to Luton, where she lived in shared accommodation as it was all her budget would allow, and she was once attacked by one of the other residents. Paterson later moved back to Burnley and now lives her partner James and their two children. She has a good relationship with her mum, which Paterson said has improved considerably since she gained her independence. She told BuzzFeed News: “Me and mum never got on and my dad was ill and I ended up going into a hostel. “Because my mum had removed me out of year 11 for home schooling there was an argument between social services and the DWP, and there was a massive appeal. I think I only won it because I’d just lost my dad. “They paid me £45 a week —   I don’t know how I was supposed to live off that. There wasn’t enough support and I’ve constantly been in debt all my life. “But if I hadn’t had that housing benefit I think I would have really gone down a bad route. When you’re in a hostel you get into a wrong crowd  —   a few of my friends turned into really hardcore druggies. I could have gone through that route. “If you’re forcing someone who doesn’t get on with their parents to stay at home, they don’t know what predicament they’re putting themselves into because they can’t afford a house. You could push them into all sorts of things  —   unsafe shared housing, girls going into trafficking. It’s scary, I get scared for some kids out there. I was lucky. ” Paterson also said she believes it isn’t necessarily beneficial for young people to stay at home beyond their teens. “Me and my mum get on a lot better now. I’d don’t think we’d have the relationship we have today if I’d gone back home,” she said. “I’m so grateful that I was stubborn and didn’t go back home  —   me and my mum wouldn’t be as close as we are today. “What the government doesn’t realise unless they’ve been in that situation is that it can be good for young people to move out. I don’t think people will be independent financially or mentally if they stay at home until they’re 22. ” Maddison Jo   20, from Cardiff, recently left home after her family’s private landlord decided to sell their home. She now lives independently, after finding her own place with the help of the charity Llamau. She claims housing benefit and has been able to continue studying beauty and nails at college. She told BuzzFeed News: “Our landlord wanted to sell  —   we were privately renting. My mum left and went to live with her cousin, and I was still behind gathering all my stuff. “I was   from my friends’ houses to my aunt’s house  —   because I go to college it was really stressful. “Housing benefit is really important to me. Jobs don’t give out a lot of money, not enough hours to earn the money you want. “It’s a big deal  —   a lot of people would have nowhere to live. I would have had to drop out of college without it, to figure out what I would do next and where I was going to live. “Other young people who may be going through the same situation as me, we rely on it, we’re not with our families. It’s really hard, so it’s good for us to have that extra help. ” A DWP spokesperson said: “Many young people setting out in work can’t afford to leave home and live on their own straight away, so this policy will ensure young people in the benefit system face the same choices as those who work. “We have put in place a wide range of exemptions to ensure that vulnerable people are protected. Crucially, the policy will not affect those who are unable to live with their parents, as they will be able to continue to claim support for their housing costs. “We recognise that young people may not have documented evidence that proves they are unable to return to the parental home. In these cases their extenuating circumstances will still be taken into account. ”  "

Upwards of 10 people have so far been arrested on suspicion of helping the men, some of whom officials say belong to a   gang in Orange County. “We’re extremely encouraged as of today,” Hallock said.  The men are believed to be living out of a white GMC van, which was reported stolen on Saturday. A man matching Duong’s description responded in south Los Angeles to an online ad to buy the van, then disappeared with it while out on a test drive, Hallock said. Stolen Vehicle ACTUAL 2008 White GMC Savana Utility Lic: 8U66466   may have been removed, It was clear the men received some kind of help in their escape, Hallock said.

The exact nature of the relationship remained unclear, and Hallock said Ravaghi denied providing the men with tools. She was still being questioned Thursday afternoon.  Nayeri is facing kidnapping and torture charges, according to court documents. In October 2012, prosecutors said he and two other men went into a couple’s home and drove them into the desert.

72079,104736, Twitter Confirms: Algorithm Coming To Your Timeline,Buzzfeed News,Alex Kantrowitz,2016-02-11,2016.0,2.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160211092722/https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/time-is-a-construct-anyway
"," Twitter is introducing an algorithmic component to its timeline that will, at times, reorder tweets, prioritizing them based on what Twitter thinks people most want to see. Twitter confirmed the changes today, which were first reported by BuzzFeed News last week. It won’t be a   change. The   tweets will make up the first few messages people see when they fire up Twitter. A    action will, as usual, bring up more tweets in Twitter’s standard   order. The algorithm will be   at first: Users will have to turn it on themselves initially. However, Twitter says it will turn the feature on for everyone in the “coming weeks. ” There will be an option to turn it off. “Today, we’re excited to share a new timeline feature that helps you catch up on the best Tweets from people you follow,” Twitter said in a blog post. The algorithm will feel heavier to casual users, and lighter to power users. Its implementation is thoughtful, meant to make Twitter more attractive to broader audiences while not ruining the core experience for its power users. Though not a full rethinking of Twitter’s feed, this new timeline will certainly reorder tweets. It will show, in some cases, tweets the algorithm determines people should see instead of simply the most recently published ones. As BuzzFeed News noted in July, Twitter’s fast flowing feed can cause people to miss some of the best content on the platform. “It was very good and clutter caught up with it,” Nate Elliot, then vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research, said at the time. Implementing an algorithm, even this light one, should help users find some of the good tweets they missed. Twitter’s Moments, which curates stories made up of tweets, is also meant to address the clutter problem. Same goes for While You Were Away, the module that sometimes appears on the top of the feed. The new algorithmic elements in the timeline will essentially be a blown out version of that module. And though the algorithmic parts will be optional, there’s precedent to indicate most people will just stick with the filtered stuff. Facebook, for instance, gives its users an option to sort their News Feeds by “Top Stories” or “Most Recent” posts. But the Most Recent section is essentially an afterthought a buried feature. On Friday, following the BuzzFeed News report, speculation about future plans sent Twitter users into a frenzy. The hashtag #RIPTwitter trended, as people expressed fury with the notion that Twitter would do anything to disturb the   order of their feeds. The firestorm drove some Twitter employees to defend the company: Tech Twitter is in rare form tonight  …     Seriously people. We aren’t idiots. Quit speculating about how we’re going to ”ruin Twitter” It didn’t seem to help: . @jeffseibert well you guys have a pretty awful track record these past few years so it’s more conditioning than jumping to conclusions. @jeffseibert Is everyone who works at Twitter really this clueless about their own users? @jeffseibert Well, like, maybe, if you gave some transparency as to what you were doing with the product I’ve used for 9 years. .. Wow people on Twitter are mean, Heh, I’ve been on Twitter since 2009, and I think this is the first time one of my Tweets has gone beyond my immediate network. In shock a bit. After the hashtag #RIPTwitter trended, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey responded with a tweetstorm: Hello Twitter! Regarding #RIPTwitter: I want you all to know we’re always listening. We never planned to reorder timelines next week. Twitter is live. Twitter is  . Twitter is about who  what you follow. And Twitter is here to stay! By becoming more  . Look at ”while you were away” at the top of your TL. Tweets you missed from people you follow. Pull to refresh to go back to  . I *love*  . We love the live stream. It’s us. And we’re going to continue to refine it to make Twitter feel more, not less, live! Twitter can help make connections in   based on dynamic interests and topics, rather than a static   graph. We get it. Thank you all for your passion and trust. We will continue to work to earn it, and we will continue to listen, and talk! While Dorsey’s tweets calmed things down, this statement was not quite a denial. And today the company made it official: an algorithm is coming to the timeline. And despite the dramatics on Twitter, not everyone hates the change. Advertisers, for the most part, love it. At least in theory. And advertisers are Twitter’s customers, so their opinion matters a lot for the product’s direction. Multiple advertising executives told BuzzFeed News that compared to Facebook, Twitter’s smaller user base makes its ad space less attractive. And the conventional wisdom is that Twitter is smaller to a large extent because it’s just too hard for casual users. So, if Twitter can help those casual users see the best stuff going on right now, every time they open the app, the bet here is that it can convert them into repeat users. The bet here is that an algorithm will help it grow because, well, machines know better than people.   "

"," Aaron C. Smith, 23, was charged with fatally shooting Gregory Gunn, 56, on February 25. Smith was arrested Wednesday, with his bond set at $150, 000. The Montgomery Police Department told BuzzFeed News the Alabama State Bureau of Investigations (SBI) is currently looking into the case, and they were unable to comment further. SBI did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment.  Bailey told reporters Wednesday that he and the SBI “agreed that if there were probable cause that a crime had been committed then an arrest would be made. ”  “After meeting extensively with SBI agents, we have concluded that probable cause exists to make an arrest in this case. ” The shooting occurred, Bailey said, after Smith was seen by neighbors reportedly stopping to talk to what he called a suspicious person. The person was later identified as Gunn, though why he was thought suspicious remained unclear. Montgomery Police Chief Ernest Finley said in a news conference Friday morning that a struggle took place between Gunn and the officer, which lasted as they moved down the block.  Neighbors said they then heard multiple gunshots and Gunn yelling for help and calling for his mother, AL. com reported. Gunn was believed to have been armed with a stick or “painting pole,” Finley said. Smith is white and had reportedly been an officer with the department since 2012.

Around a dozen protestors held signs saying “Justice For Gunn” and “Black Lives Matter. ” Some publicly called for white police to no longer patrol predominantly black neighborhoods. The protest reportedly caused the meeting to adjourn early. Bailey concluded his announcement by addressing “rumors” circulating in the press and on social media that he deemed “completely untrue. ”  "

"," The Council on   Relations on Tuesday filed two lawsuits  —   one a    —   against the federal government for placing citizens on its terror watch lists without due process. One    plaintiff, identified as Baby Doe, was “seven months old when his boarding pass was first stamped with the ‘SSSS’ designation, indicating that he had been designated as a ‘known or suspected terrorist,’” one suit, filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, said. “While passing through airport security, he was subjected to extensive searches, pat downs, and chemical testing,” the suit said. CAIR legal director Lena Masri told BuzzFeed News that the lawsuits were filed on behalf of the “thousands upon thousands of Muslims” placed on watch lists. The class action suit seeks monetary compensation. Another suit demands the plaintiffs are removed from the lists a court ruling that the watch lists are unconstitutional and official notice when people are placed on watch lists and an explanation. “The terrorism watch lists are premised on the false notion that the government can somehow accurately predict whether an innocent American citizen will commit a crime in the future based on religious affiliation or First Amendment activities,” Masri said in a statement. The lawsuits state that the FBI and Justice Department nominated 227, 932 people to the watch list in 2009. In 2013, that number more than doubled to 468, 749. Citizens are not notified that they have been placed on the watch list, and often only realize it when “they feel the web of consequences burdening their lives and aspirations. ” The lawsuits also state that Dearborn, Michigan, a city of fewer than 100, 000 people that has a prominent Muslim community, “contains the   concentration of Americans on the federal government’s watch list. ” According to the website maintained by the federal government’s Information Sharing Environment  —   created by federal law in 2004  —   the Terrorist Screening Center’s watch list “supports the ability of front line screening agencies to positively identify known or suspected terrorists trying to obtain visas, enter the country, board aircraft, or engage in other activity. ” The description goes on to note that the TSC is “dedicated to ensuring the data it stores is maintained in a manner consistent with protecting the privacy and civil liberties of Americans. ” The lawsuits include testimony from each plaintiff’s experience being on a list, detailing alleged efforts to recruit informants and detainment inside cells in what the suit calls unlivable conditions. Osama Ahmed, from Wayne County, Michigan, was 18 years old when he was stopped at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in February or March 2011. Federal agents confiscated his cell phone and USB drive and subjected him to six or seven hours of interviews without granting him a phone call, according to the lawsuits. A few days after he was released, federal agents showed up at his home. In a video recorded by CAIR, Ahmed said the agents asked to interview him alone. They took him to a Mongolian BBQ restaurant, and tried to convince him to work overseas with the federal government as an informant. “They were telling me stuff like, ‘We’ll teach you how to skydive,’ and, ‘You can use whatever weapon you want,’” he said. “It made me feel betrayed by my own country that I was born and raised in,” he added. “I just wanted my name off that list. ” According to the lawsuit, Anas Elhady, 22, is “routinely referred to secondary inspection, handcuffed and detained” by U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CPB) when he attempts to   the country from Canada. In May 2015, Elhady was detained for six hours at a border stop at the Bridge Port Entry of Detroit. “After the CPB officers confiscated Mr. Elhady’s jacket and shoes, they detained him in a small, freezing cold holding cell with bright lights,” the lawsuit reads. He eventually lost consciousness, and officers called an ambulance to take him to the hospital. Elhady was handcuffed to the stretcher. A nurse asked him why his lips had turned blue, and when he told her, she approached one of the border protection agents. “He shut her down,” Elhady said. “He told her to shut up. ” “The government has engaged in a   delusion that being placed on a watch list is not a big deal,” Gadeir Abbas, one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs, told the AP. “The goal is for the   to affect every aspect of these people’s lives. ” BuzzFeed News has reached out to the FBI for more comment.

"," It was 8 p. m. on a rainy Thursday night in Manila. Clad in a sleek black dress with    sleeves, Angel Panitan waved her ID in front of a uniformed guard in the lobby of the Raffles Building in the   Philippine district of Pasig. The guard nodded in recognition without looking at Angel’s card, which showed not just the female name she’s been known as since 2007, but the male name she was given legally at birth. Angel walked confidently to the elevator bays and greeted several   including a woman she manages. At the reception desk, Angel asked me to wait on a tan   bench where some trainees were chatting jovially in Tagalog about getting their IDs, while Angel spoke to her compliance officer to get clearance for me to go inside. Security is tight in call centers, since companies are worried about protecting client data, but after a few minutes, Angel returned and motioned for me to come through. In the Philippines, transgender women get no recognition from the national government, let alone legal protections. They cannot change their names or gender markers on any legal documents, even if they have sex reassignment surgery. There are LGBT employment protections in some areas of Manila, but not in Pasig, where Angel works. Even when these protections are applied to transgender women in the Philippines  —   such as in one case when a trans woman was barred from using the women’s room at work and filed discrimination charges  —   they are officially classified as homosexual men. Yet, against these odds, Angel is the boss. The    manages 29 call center agents and a rotating crop of trainees at TREC, overseeing the quality of their work, taking particularly difficult calls called “escalations,” and reporting to the center’s United States office. And she isn’t alone. In the Philippines, call centers have become havens for   people, a place where they can experiment with their gender presentation and identity. Since most of the labor takes place over the phone, employees assigned male at birth may adopt traditionally feminine names, take on a “female voice,” or wear women’s clothing while talking to customers, a freedom that would be impossible in most other industries in the country. For decades, beauty parlors were a rare refuge where   Filipinas could openly work, at the expense of low wages. But today “call centers are the new beauty parlor,” said Naomi Fontanos, the head of a major Philippine transgender organization and herself a former call center worker. Call centers emerged in the country in the   and eventually displaced India as the industry’s global leader. Companies like IBM, JPMorgan, and eBay have set up customer service operations in the Philippines as descendants of American colonization, Filipinos often speak English with lighter accents and have greater access to American culture than Indians, who were colonized by the British. There are now more than 1 million call center workers in a country of 98 million, and the industry accounts for an estimated 10% of the Philippine economy. Because trans women in the Philippines are legally classified as men, there are no reliable statistics to quantify their numbers in the industry. But Emmanuel David, an assistant professor in women and gender studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder, is working on a book about the subject and confirms their substantial presence in these companies. In one of his interviews, one woman even claimed that 3 out of 4 workers in her company are trans. According to David, this is because trans women talk among themselves and congregate in workplaces that have a reputation for being  . David said that trans women act as “emotional  ” who become indispensable for livening up overnight shifts and dealing with the Western customers they cater to. And because customers only hear them on the phone, those who would balk at being served by a trans woman are none the wiser. Since women are often perceived as more comforting than men, presenting as women on the phone can actually advance call center workers’ careers. In fact, Angel said that many call center employees she knows first took on a female persona while on the phone with customers  —   long before they personally identified as trans. What’s more, success at work can give those with nascent trans identities the confidence to present as women in real life. “In call centers, we are embraced and celebrated not because of our gender and who we are,” Angel told me, “but we are equally treated because of what we produce and perform in the company. ” The call center industry has thus not only promoted transgender women, but actually shaped their identities in fundamental ways. Today, many of the most prominent trans leaders in the country are former call center workers. “Trans women often don’t enter the call center as trans,” David said. “The wages help enable and produce that identity. ” Angel did not grow up thinking she would be a call center worker, just as she didn’t grow up thinking she was trans. In the 1990s, in the rural province of Pangasinan, 125 miles north of Manila, Angel thought of herself as bakla, an indigenous identity that Filipinos think of as   distinct from either boys or girls. Angel offered details of her childhood as she walked through the main call center floor, an open space with a low drop ceiling, bathed dimly in fluorescent light. (Unlike typical American workspaces, the walls were painted teal and the cubicle dividers were fuchsia, reflecting a Filipino taste for bright colors.) “My brother played with cars, but I stole my sisters’ dolls,” Angel said. “That was when I started to think I am bakla. ” Feminine boys don’t face as much stigma in the Philippines compared to the U. S. because of its long indigenous history of   people. People assigned male at birth who grow up to identify as bakla are typically permitted to have feminine mannerisms and sometimes even wear girl’s clothes or accessories  —   but can’t grow their hair long or wear dresses, which would risk having them be mistaken for girls. “Even when I was a kid, my family really knew that I’m bakla. I’d rather wear girls’ than boys’ tops,” Angel said. However, her mom did not allow her to wear dresses or skirts and pressured her to wear men’s clothing when she became an adult. Angel presented as male the first time she entered the call center industry in 2005, like the vast majority of workers who now identify as trans women. And it was actually on the phone that she was first perceived as a woman, by American customers calling from abroad. “I have a feminine voice,” Angel said, “so customers kept calling me ma’am during training. ” That was when Angel’s supervisor started allowing her to use a female alias, first Madison, which rhymes with her legal name, and then eventually Angel, the name she now uses both in and out of work. That first experience of being affirmed and treated seamlessly as a woman by American customers profoundly influenced her desire to identify as a woman in the rest of her life. “I realized how much I enjoyed being feminine,” Angel said. “And I discovered there was a big advantage as a woman over the phone. When a man is irate I can be sweet to them, and women customers are nicer to their own gender. ” She also noted that because homophobic customers would often ask for another agent if they detected a gay man’s voice, which could lead to a bad evaluation, workers are forced to affect conventionally male or female voices. It’s often easier for bakla to shift to a female voice rather than affect a masculine male voice, and a portion of those   people then go on to identify as transgender women. Eventually, Angel’s wages and financial independence also enabled her to dress as a woman. “When I’m earning, I have my own money, that’s the time I’m buying my own clothes, so my [men’s] underwear becomes panties,” Angel said. She met other trans women who told her about using oral contraceptives to increase her estrogen levels. “That’s when I started transitioning,” she said. “I like to dress, I like to wear women’s clothes. And then I really lived like a woman. ” Call center work has given Angel the financial freedom to determine how to dress and look, away from the pressures of her family. Because of trans people’s lack of legal rights in the country, there is no   medical care available to Angel, so she takes oral contraceptives to get her estrogen. Angel also takes Androcur, a medicine used to treat advanced prostate cancer by blocking testosterone production, that’s available over the counter in the Philippines. Angel’s income has also allowed her to obtain feminizing surgeries and treatments that she couldn’t have afforded without her call center wages. “My birthday present to myself the first year I started working at the call center in 2005 was a nose job,” she said. Since then, she’s had collagen injections on her forehead, cheeks, chin, breasts, and hips, as well as a “ ” for her nose job. “All of the trans women I know have had procedures done to their hips, chest, or face,” she added. These procedures have added up to several thousand dollars, which Angel saved from her $   income at the call center. Before the advent of that industry, the only other jobs where Angel could have presented as female were in the beauty industry, where she would have been fortunate to earn $150 a month as a hairstylist or makeup artist. Angel’s mother wanted her to be a teacher, but she wanted to be able to dress in feminine clothing and go by her chosen name at work. “When you’re a [male] teacher in the Philippines, you have to dress in men’s clothes,” she said. “You have to be a man. I don’t want to become a teacher, because what would I wear? Slacks, polo shirts? I don’t see myself dressing that way, so I said no!” Angel thrives as a call center worker, having been with her company for eight years and promoted several times. She started out as a regular worker, fielding customer service calls for Verifone, a company that makes credit card machines. These days, she serves as one of two team leaders who manage Verifone’s   account. Unlike some of University of Colorado professor David’s subjects, Angel works in an environment without a particularly high proportion of trans women. There are three other trans women she’s aware of at TREC, who, along with her, account for just 1% of the company’s   workforce. But this makes it all the more striking that she’s a   manager, as she leads a team that consists exclusively of cisgender men and women. Not only that, but she does so in a country that has the greatest gender parity in the   region, with a greater proportion of women in most government and professional sectors compared to the U. S. Angel’s status as a trans woman does not seem to have hurt her prospects. Being trans may have even boosted Angel’s career, as she has carved out an enthusiastic and entertaining presence in her company. “I’m quite active in   events. I can really be relied upon for my creativity for things like pageants, sports fests, and Christmas parties. I’m always visible in those occasions,” she said. “But it’s also about my performance, my attendance and punctuality. ” Bakla have a long reputation in the Philippines as entertainers  —   singers, dancers, and comedians. They’re thought to be funny, dramatic, and relentlessly energetic, great qualities to have on shifts that last through the night. (Most of the employees at TREC work during American business hours, 9 a. m to 5 p. m. ET, which corresponds to 9 p. m. to 5 a. m. in the Philippines.) But Angel is also quick to distance herself from some of the stigmas associated with bakla, even those who now identify as trans. Because bakla and trans women often have limited employment options, they have a reputation as sex workers. “I know a lot of prostitutes,” Angel said. “They’re graduates of schools. They’re graduates of some courses. It’s a waste. ” Government estimates put the number of sex workers in the Philippines as high as 800, 000, many of whom take on this type of work because of poverty and a lack of employment opportunities and, consequently, face violence and discrimination. There are no reliable statistics on how many of these workers are transgender. Angel was particularly critical of trans women who do sex work and spend their earnings on luxuries like Louis Vuitton bags or fancy clothes. “Do they have savings?” Angel asked. “They bought that very expensive bag. How about their family? Is their family still eating? I know these people, and I know they’re not wealthy. Useless extravagance, just to buy something expensive. ” While she spoke, I couldn’t help but think that her dismissal of sex workers reflected her own anxieties about her status in Filipino society. The relatively high wages in call centers may shield trans women there from the conditions that precipitate sex work, but they still run into economic difficulties. According to David, the women he interviewed had mixed experiences when it came to hiring and promotion, and many have not been as fortunate as Angel. “A lot of those I spoke with were in   positions, although a number I did speak with were managers or supervisors, but that’s after many, many years of being there. They didn’t just magically appear in those leadership positions,” he said. Based on his interviews, David believes that trans workers still encounter significant obstacles in promotion and regularly perform functions that are not strictly part of their job, like the organizing or entertaining that Angel described. However, David conducted the bulk of his interviews between 2009 and 2012. Conditions could have improved since that time. For her part, Angel feels that working at TREC shields her not just from the requirement to wear men’s clothes, but from other forms of discrimination that are common with trans women in the Philippines, such as verbal harassment and outright exclusion from public spaces. People may question or deny her gender identity outside the walls of the call center, but within its confines, Angel feels confident and secure. At 10 p. m. and in full makeup, Trixie Maristela languidly entered Starbucks in the posh district of Bonifacio Global City wearing an orange sleeveless dress, after taping a segment for a news documentary show. She has become one of the Philippines’ most recognizable trans women, having recently won Miss International Queen, the most   international pageant for trans women, which is held annually in Pattaya, Thailand. Her success has led to a talent contract from Viva, one of the country’s foremost talent agencies and film production companies. Sitting across from me, Trixie looked like someone out of anime, with her long false lashes, prominent eyes, and slim nose. Her success has come seemingly overnight. Less than a year ago, she was a call center worker like Angel. From town festivals to schools, television to companies, pageants are ubiquitous in the Philippines, especially as Filipina women have excelled in major international pageants  —   like Pia Wurtzbach’s controversial win in this year’s Miss Universe.   “gay” pageants are known as venues for bakla and trans women to not just display their beauty, but also impress and entertain. In a televised pageant in 2014, for instance, Trixie was asked why she should win the crown. She replied in a mix of English and Tagalog: “Aside from the undeniable fact that I look gorgeous today, I slept for eight hours and it’s plainly visible that I’m very fresh. The others look haggard. That’s all. Thank you. ” “The pageant culture and the call center culture are intertwined,” David said. He spoke to several women who supplemented their income through beauty pageants, as Trixie and Angel both have. “Sometimes they’ll even hold pageants in the call center,” David added. “It’s like a company picnic. People want to go to work and have fun and not feel stressed out. Stuff like that can relieve stressful situations. ” Trixie worked as a multilingual senior business analyst for Accenture, one of the largest business process outsourcing companies in the world, a job she quit when she won a prestigious local pageant, Miss Gay Manila, this past June. That win led to her invitation to participate in Miss International Queen. Trixie credits her call center work, especially her mastery of English, as a big asset in her pageant success. “In the call center industry, it’s a must that you know English language,” she said. “In most beauty pageants if they hear you speak impeccable English it’s a plus factor. So it helped a lot. ” Trixie also traces the origins of her trans identity to the early days of her call center work, while she was still in college in 2006 at the University of the Philippines, Diliman, the most prestigious public university in the country. As a European languages and literature major, Trixie was exposed to gender theorists from the West, wrote her college thesis on transgender representation in the films of Pedro Almodóvar, and joined an LGBT student group. “That’s how I learned about the differences between gays, bisexuals, and trans,” Trixie said. “Before that I just used the term bakla to refer to all of them. ” Trixie’s early experiences in the call center industry weren’t as positive as Angel’s. “Back in college the environment wasn’t so great,” she said. “I had a problem using the female restroom because they didn’t understand the term transgender yet. Back then, one company told me, ‘We can accept you but you can’t   you have to cut your hair, you have to wear business attire for males.’ I was surprised because, for some companies, it’s more important for you to dress up based on what they think you are instead of who you think you are. ” Trixie said that she applied to Accenture in 2011 and was told she couldn’t use the women’s restroom. She refused to work there because of the policy, and she ended up taking a job offer elsewhere. “Using the female restroom is very important to me,” she said. “It’s only when I reapplied in 2013 that their policy had changed. ” Over email, Accenture’s managing director of global inclusion and diversity, Nellie Borrero, responded to Trixie’s account by writing in part: “Gender identity and gender expression have been included in our global policy since 2010 and we are making progress putting this into practice across our local offices. ” She noted that they’ve made yearly progress in rolling out   bathrooms, while taking local regulations and leasing restrictions into account. Though not directly confirming Trixie’s experience, Borrero and Accenture’s own diversity documents show that   policies take time to implement, which may account for the difference between her experiences in 2011 and 2013. “In being a company that is incredibly diverse,” Borrero wrote in conclusion, “we strive to accommodate transgender employees and visitors by finding solutions that are safe, convenient and respectful. We are committed to progressing as we continue to be strong advocates for inclusion. ” Indeed, a section of Accenture’s policy documents details the prohibition of “harassment on the basis of gender identity and gender expression in all countries, including where there is no protection under local laws. ” Extending   policies developed in the United States to Filipino workers, even when there are no local laws that prohibit discrimination, is starkly different from other Philippine professional sectors, where those who are legally born male are routinely required to wear masculine clothes and have little legal recourse if they’re discriminated against for presenting as female. Angel herself isn’t entirely free to fully identify as a woman, even at her   workplace. Companies must conform to government policies, and because Angel can’t change her legal name, her birth name still appears on her company ID. An even bigger issue in her    life is that while there is one   restroom inside TREC, common men’s and women’s rooms are shared among several companies in her building and are controlled by building management. Because Angel is not in full control of her breaks, she has no choice but to use a restroom that does not conform to her gender if a   happens to be using the lone unisex restroom at work. “I was caught once and the guard took a picture of me, then asked me to pay a fine,” Angel said. “After that I stopped going to the women’s room. I have to go to the men’s room now if the single bathroom is taken. ” Trans women have grown increasingly intolerant of discrimination after exposure to   companies at call centers. Despite her celebrity, Trixie herself, along with fashion designer Veejay Floresca, was denied entry into Valkyrie, a   nightclub in the Taguig district, last June and posted about her experience on Facebook. She joined several leaders of trans organizations in the Philippines in a meeting with Valkyrie management  —   Naomi Fontanos from GANDA Filipinas, Dindi Tan from the Association for Transgender Philippines, and Meggan Evangelista from Babaylanes Inc.  —   all of whom are former call center workers. The group convinced Valkyrie management to lift their    policy and formulate training guidelines for their employees. “My vision is to make the trans community empowered and that later on there would be no more Valkyrie issues,” Trixie said. “I’m not really looking for special treatment, just for trans [people] to be respected and not necessarily be assimilated, but for their talents and skills to be distinguished and to be recognized as well. ” Unlike Trixie and Angel, who like wearing dresses and skirts, Giles Po  —   a manager for Sutherland Global Services, another multinational call center  —   met me before work wearing a gray   jeans, and canvas sneakers. Sitting at Starbucks on a sunny and humid afternoon, her hand brushed against her long, thick hair as she waved hello to a group of men  —   presumably    —   a couple of whom said hello back. With a touch of lipstick on and no other makeup, she smiled widely, revealing a mouthful of braces. Sutherland’s clients include large internet companies like eBay and PayPal, and Giles specifically directs    logistics and operations for a team that does customer service for eBay in the U. K. She is legally assigned male but often perceived as a woman, though she doesn’t care what gender people think she is  —   she even finds it “validating” when people get confused. “It’s fine with me if people are going to call me gay, if they’re going to call me transgender, or whatnot,” Giles said, her   rings rapping against the table. “As long as there is dignity when they address me as a person, because what I would like to make sure is that when I face people, they’re going to see me as a person, not anyone else, not any other thing. ” Unlike Angel and Trixie, who are firm in their identities as trans women, Giles’ gender identity is harder to describe. She is routinely perceived as a cisgender woman by strangers, but moves and speaks in the theatrical and flamboyant manner associated with bakla. She has not taken hormones or undergone feminizing procedures, nor does she want to. She is also fine with using the men’s restroom. Giles’   position frustrates people like Trixie, who want trans women in the Philippines to enjoy the same rights as they do in the United States and believes that complacency hinders progress. She echoed the sentiments of a number of   trans women I’ve met, who view Giles’ position as uneducated and provincial. “Many Filipinos, they’re not as educated about the West,” Trixie said. “They don’t know about the rights that Americans have, and they don’t understand that if you feel yourself to be a woman, you can live your life as a woman even if you are transgender. ” For his part, researcher David is concerned that over time, trans women will increasingly distance themselves from bakla, and that gains trans women make in terms of respect and rights may not eventually apply to more marginalized, less respectable gender categories. If trans women in the Philippines are able to win legal recognition that will allow them to legally change their names and gender markers on government documents, they can live as women without having to disclose their trans identity, and be treated better compared to bakla. “Many trans women position themselves as the good citizen worthy of rights,” David said. “And that positioning is sometimes done by distancing themselves from people who are seen as uneducated, or not decent, or loud, or engaged in sex work. ” Though she herself is clear about her transgender identity, Angel doesn’t believe that bakla will be unduly marginalized even if trans women continue to gain rights. “I think it’s always going to be more acceptable for Filipino families to have a bakla rather than a trans family member,” she said. While the existence of people like Giles who confuse gender categories might make it more difficult to define and obtain rights for trans women, Angel believes that there’s room for multiple identities to thrive. “I have many different friends: gay, bisexual, and trans. I think we can all be happy together,” Angel said. On her day off, Angel sat in a modest room in Pasig, in the house of a former  . She was living cheaply as a boarder instead of getting her own apartment, because she hopes to someday start her own handbag business. Her mother was still a   bus ride north, and her three other siblings were either working abroad or in other parts of the country. They have an ongoing group chat on Facebook, where they say hello and post pictures almost every day. She showed me pictures of her family as we sat together on the bottom of her bunk bed, with boxes of her clothes piled on top. Outside of the workplace, Angel revealed more of the struggles and indignities she and other trans women have to bear in Philippine culture. Even as she experiences a certain amount of social acceptance, and her company allows her to work and even to be a manager, Angel still encounters many obstacles in her daily life. The pervasiveness of Catholicism after the Philippines’ centuries as a Spanish colony has made Filipinos deeply conservative in certain ways, particularly in their family structures. A clear example of this contradiction between social tolerance and institutional discrimination is Angel’s relationship with her   Marvin, whom she’d been dating for two years. Marriage and children are still generally considered to be default conditions in the Philippines, and a wedding wasn’t possible for the two of them  —   trans women are recognized as men legally, and   marriage isn’t legal. Furthermore, Filipino children are expected to obey their parents even as adults, and Marvin’s Catholic parents would never allow him to be in a permanent relationship with Angel, who they saw as bakla. Marvin himself had expressed doubt about their future. “My boyfriend always reminds me that he will someday get married to someone else,” Angel said, her usually confident voice tinged with melancholy. Marvin wants to have children, she said, and that’s why he thinks they can’t be together forever. Angel also said that it’s common for men in the Philippines to marry “real” women, but continue to see transgender women as mistresses. Since it was her day off and she wanted to relax, Angel and I decided to get massages in the posh Taguig district at The Spa, a popular establishment that has several branches all over Metro Manila. We filled out forms with our information and health waivers they didn’t ask us for identification. Then the receptionist asked us to sit down. Angel and I sat on wire mesh lounge chairs as the women whispered among themselves, something about showers. Eventually, a woman in a black suit who looked like she was in charge motioned me over to talk. She asked us if we could shower separately, rather than using the common facilities for women. I asked her why we couldn’t use the women’s locker room. “I think your companion  …    Angel? Is she  …    a girl?” the manager asked. “Yeah,” I replied. “So she can share the steam room with other  …    ” “Yeah, she can share the steam room with other women. ” “Yeah, because  …    so it’s all right. ” It’s only then that the manager allowed us to go to the women’s side of the spa facility. After our massages, Angel and I had dinner at Abe, a restaurant that serves regional Filipino food. “What I really felt was shame,” Angel said between bites, referring to the manager’s invasive question. “So I just tried not to pay attention. The truth is, I was shocked. ” She described another incident, at a restaurant and bar called Aruba in 2007. She was with a school friend who was visiting from Canada along with four of their other schoolmates, but the security guard refused to let Angel in because they have a    policy. “They told me I couldn’t go in, but there was a dog inside,” she said. “My friend told them, ‘What’s the difference between that creature and my friend? ’” Earlier this month, Angel told me that, under immense pressure from his parents, Marvin broke up with her. “He exchanged me for a real woman,” she chatted me in Tagalog over Facebook. “It’s heartbreaking but true. ” She added that Marvin wanted to keep seeing her in secret but she refused. Even though Angel has been discriminated against numerous times for having a body that doesn’t match people’s perceptions of womanhood  —   and even though the discrimination she faces would likely be lessened if she passed more as a cisgender woman  —   she has no plans to undergo genital surgery. “I’m happy with that part of my body the way it is,” she said. “I know trans women who’ve had surgery and haven’t been satisfied, so many of us don’t want to have surgery. It’s too big of a risk. ” Angel has been really happy with her sex life and doesn’t want to potentially compromise it just to fit society’s expectations. However, she admitted she would have to think twice if the law changed and the Philippine government made genital surgery a condition to be legally classified as a woman  —   still a requirement in many U. S. states  —   which would shield her from much of the discrimination she experiences. Angel expressed resentment that there’s a possibility, even a likelihood that genital surgery will become a government requirement. “Change of name and gender marker shouldn’t be that hard to achieve,” she said. Angel believes that the government simply needs to consult Western clinical studies on gender identity and expression to come to the conclusion that surgery shouldn’t be required to be legally classified as a woman. Angel looks up to Trixie as an example of an ideal trans woman who has used her newfound celebrity for greater rights and recognition of trans women in the Philippines. “I’m lucky that now, if I go to a place like Valkyrie, I will not be discriminated against because of women like Trixie,” she said. In particular, Angel admires the way Trixie has handled herself both in her politics and in her life, as the beauty queen has been the subject of numerous interviews and TV segments since her win at Miss International Queen. Angel knows that Trixie has a longtime partner, Art Santa Ana, and spent a period of time several years ago hiding her trans status for the sake of his family. “I understand why she did that,” Angel said, “and I envy her for having a boyfriend who is willing to publicly say he is with her. ” Most of all, Angel admires Trixie for changing perceptions of trans women in the Philippines as they move away from the legacy of their bakla identity and conduct themselves with grace and dignity. “Trixie is an activist by means of giving education to people. She doesn’t go to the streets,” Angel said. “That’s the right way for people to see trans people. We’re not just the stereotype, working on the street or at the salon. We’re normal. We’re educated. We’re respectable. ” ●   "

"," “I know what I’m good at, and I know what I’m not good at. I’m not so sure Donald knows what he’s not good at,” Cuban said on 77 WABC’s Bernie and Sid.  Cuban said Trump was good at putting his name on big buildings and licensing his name on hotels, but it isn’t clear how much money that has made him. “He’s good at that. Whether or not that’s made him a billionaire, I don’t know,” Cuban said. “He’s not transparent enough for us to actually know. ” Cuban said he went over Trump’s FEC filings and saw Trump was “horrible” at many aspects of business.  “I think he’s good at real estate I do give him a lot of credit there. I think he’s good at branding real estate,” he said. “I don’t think he’s very good at brands for non —  real estate products. And, to me, it’s more a reflection of desperation. “So when you’re putting your name on steaks, and you’re putting your name on water, you’re putting your name on playing cards, you’re putting your name on all this nonsense, right? You’re not gonna make big bucks, no matter what. It’s not like Trump Steaks were gonna make him $100 million. It’s not like it was gonna make him $5 million. ” “I asked, ‘What the hell are you doing?’ Are you that desperate for money?’ Seriously,” Cuban said, saying Trump couldn’t say no if someone was going to write him a check. Later in the interview, Cuban said he has more money than Trump.  “It’s not even close, I do,” Cuban said. “Before all the Trumpians jump on me on who has more money, the reason I know is when you file your federal election campaign reports, you have to list all your cash and liquid securities and bonds. You have to list them one by one. So we know without any question that as of May 27, Donald doesn’t have more than $165 million in cash and securities and bonds. “And trust me, I’ve got a lot of more than that in cash, securities, and bonds,” he continued. “And so you know, I’m willing to bet dimes against dollars that that’s pretty much what he’s got. ”  "

","  A Michigan judge on Tuesday threw out the murder convictions of a Detroit man who, at age 14, pleaded guilty to killing four people  —   acts that a professional hit man took credit for years ago. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy also agreed to not   Davontae Sanford, now 23. She based her decision on a lengthy report by the Michigan State Police detailing a yearlong reinvestigation of the Runyon Street quadruple homicide that was completed on May 20, 2016. The report, which prosecutors plan to discuss in greater detail on Thursday, alleges that former Detroit Police Deputy Chief James Tolbert committed perjury when he testified that Sanford drew a diagram of the crime scene in its entirety, including the location of the victims’ bodies, during his interrogation. Sanford’s confession, however, had raised several red flags. He told the police that he carried out the crimes with three other people, all of whom had alibis. He also gave police the location where he said he tossed the gun, but it was never found. Finally, Sanford told police that before the shootings he and his accomplices plotted the murders at a Coney Island restaurant, but it had been closed for years. Still, in 2007, Sanford pleaded guilty and was convicted at age 15 of the killings, ultimately serving more than nine years of a   to   sentence despite a professional hit man, Vincent Smothers, coming forward and taking responsibility for the slayings just two weeks after Sanford was sentenced. Smothers also led police to the gun used in the Runyon Street killings, which turned out to be a perfect ballistics match. He also insisted Sanford played no role. Despite the inconsistencies and Smothers’ confession, Sanford tried unsuccessfully to reverse his plea, claiming his confession was coerced by police and that he only said what he said because the    thought it was the only way he would get to go home. However, it wasn’t until last month, when Worthy’s office received the final report on the Runyon killings from the state police, that authorities agreed to drop the charges. Sanford’s legal team lauded his exoneration. “After 3, 185 days of prison time for a crime he did not commit, Davontae finally got justice today,” said Megan Crane,   of the Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth at Northwestern Pritzker Law School. “Davontae and his family, and many lawyers, have fought long and hard to show the truth in this case. We could not be happier that this day is finally here. ” She also applauded the Michigan State Police for a “truly extraordinary” reinvestigation of the Runyon Street murders and Sanford’s innocence. Crane told BuzzFeed News that Sanford’s case “is a powerful illustration of a series of systematic failures of our criminal justice system. ” On his false confession, Crane said “it will happen again unless changes are made. ” “We are pleased that Davontae Sanford finally will have this injustice corrected, albeit nine years too late. This has been an extraordinary case in which the guilty party took responsibility, but the justice system took many years to acknowledge the complete breakdown that allowed for Davontae to sit in prison for nine years,” said David Moran, director of the Michigan Innocence Clinic. “Davontae can now return to his family and, for the first time in his adult life, live as a free man. ” BuzzFeed News reached out to the Michigan State Police about the report on the Runyon Street killings, but did not immediately hear back. “No one can give Davontae Sanford and his family back the nine years he has spent in jail for a crime he did not commit, but the court’s decision today corrects a grave injustice,” said Heidi Naasko, pro bono counsel for the law firm Dykema Gossett PLLC. “The entire legal team is thrilled that he will not spend another day in prison for a crime he did not commit. ” Davontae Sanford’s sister, Deshonda Davis, also reacted to the news of her brother’s imminent release from jail on Tuesday.

According to reports, a suicide bomber ripped open a gate to the mausoleum around 11 p. m. allowing a second bomber and nine gunmen to storm the entrance and open fire on security forces and pilgrims visiting for    the holiday that marks the end of Ramadan. Police said a third bomber was killed before he was able to set off his explosive. The holy site also came under rocket fire during the attack claimed by ISIS, according to Reuters. About two hours after the attack started, police said the situation was under control and that all 12 attackers involved in the incident had been killed, the AP reported. The bombing comes after nearly 300 people were killed Sunday in an ISIS attack in Baghdad, the deadliest bombing in Iraq since the U. S. invasion in 2003. During Sunday’s attack, two car bombs went off in predominantly Shiite areas  —   one in the commercial district of Karrada and the other in an area north of the capitol.

"," San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick stirred controversy in a preseason game against the Green Bay Packers on Friday night when he remained seated during the national anthem. On Saturday Kaepernick said he refused to support a country that he believes oppresses black people and other minorities. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick said during an interview with NFL Media. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder. ” Kaepernick added that he did not tell his team or anyone else of his decision ahead of time. “This is not something that I am going to run by anybody,” he said. “I am not looking for approval. I have to stand up for people that are oppressed. ” In a statement sent to BuzzFeed News, the 49ers said that all players have the right to exercise their freedom of expression: The    said that he spent a lot of time considering when, and how, he would make a stand for racial justice. “I felt that I needed to understand the situation better,” he said in his statement. Kaepernick joins a growing legion of athletes who have taken a stand against police brutality, racial profiling, and the extrajudicial killings of unarmed black people in the US. In 2012, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and several other Miami Heat players took a photo in black hoodies as a tribute to Trayvon Martin. Two years later, Cleveland Browns wide receiver Andrew Hawkins drew fire from the Cleveland Police Department when he wore a   calling for justice for Tamir Rice and John Crawford III to practice. Most recently, several WNBA teams were fined, and individual players penalized, for wearing Black Lives Matter shirts. The president of the WNBA later rescinded the disciplinary measures. Some people on Twitter expressed their disdain for Kaepernick’s decision. But others applauded his decision and pointed out that it’s his constitutional right to not stand. Kaepernick signaled he knew his silent protest could trigger outrage that may prove harmful to his career or financial interests. “If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right,” he said.

"," WASHINGTON  —   The North Carolina voting restrictions struck down by a federal appeals court earlier this summer will remain off the books for November’s election, following a Supreme Court order on Wednesday. The closely divided justices denied North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory’s request to halt enforcement of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals decision striking down five voting restrictions while the state seeks Supreme Court review of the decision. Among the provisions in the law that the appeals court has ordered the state not to enforce are limits on the type of photo ID required for voting reductions to the amount of early voting in the state and elimination of   registration,    provisional voting, and preregistration that allowed   and    to indicate an intent to register when they turned 18. McCrory asked that the justices allow the state to enforce three of those provisions  —   the voter ID provision, the reduction in early voting, and the elimination of the preregistration  —   this election while seeking Supreme Court review of the 4th Circuit’s ruling. The Obama administration and organizations that had sued the state over the law opposed the stay request. Justice Clarence Thomas would have granted the stay as to all three provisions. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito would have granted the stay as to all of the provisions except for the preregistration provision  —   which would have had little to no effect at this point on this year’s eligible voters. In other words, as to the voter ID and early voting parts of the law, there was a   split on whether to grant McCrory’s request and allow the state to enforce those provisions this fall. It takes a majority of the court to grant a stay, however, which meant that five justices would have needed to have voted for a stay in order for it to be granted. Notably, no justice provided a   “courtesy” fifth vote in support of the stay request  —   a move that Justice Stephen Breyer did take earlier this month when a the case of a transgender student presented the same scenario: four justices willing to vote for a stay, which is all that would be needed for the court to take the appeal when the cert petition is before the justices but not enough justices to grant a stay while that appeal is decided. In such circumstances, a justice can  —   as Breyer did in the earlier case  —   provide a “courtesy” fifth vote in order to allow for a stay while the cert petition can be considered. On Wednesday, however, none of the four other justices  —   Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan  —   did so, leaving the 4th Circuit’s injunction against North Carolina’s voting restrictions in place. In a statement, McCrory took aim at his opponent for the governorship, Attorney General Roy Cooper, along with the “four liberal justices” voting against McCrory’s request. “North Carolina has been denied basic voting rights already granted to more than 30 other states to protect the integrity of one person, one vote through a   voter ID law,” McCrory said in the statement. “Even without any support from our state’s attorney general, we were pleased that four justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, agreed with this right while four liberal justices blocked North Carolina protections afforded by our sensible voter laws. ” 			North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory’s request before the Supreme Court related only to three of the five provisions of the law at issue. This story initially stated that all five provisions were a part of his request.

","’ A new study shows that the sugar industry paid scientists in the 1960s to downplay the link between sugar and heart disease  —   blaming saturated fat, instead.’ ’ Big Sugar did this by exploiting growing concern over coronary heart disease.’ ’ When the evidence started to mount that sugar was bad for heart health, the SRF launched a campaign to drown out sugar’s critics.’ ’ The SRF paid three Harvard scientists to publish a 1967 literature review that would discredit studies that showed a link between sugar and heart disease, while demonizing saturated fat.’ ’ As a result, dietary recommendations at the time (and until recently) focused on reducing fat intake to prevent heart disease.’ ’ But in reality we now know that moderate amounts of saturated fat and added sugar can be part of a healthy diet.’ ’ FYI, the food industry playing a role in nutrition research isn’t an old timey practice that stopped in the ’60s.’ ’ You can read the Sugar Association’s statement in response to the UCSF article here. ’] The research is the result of a review of hundreds of internal documents and correspondence from the SRF. In a 1954 speech to a sugar industry association, SRF’s president Henry Hass proposed they capitalize on nutritionists’ suggestion that there might be a link between Americans’   diet and these high rates of heart disease. What better time to shift the blame to saturated fats, while making sugar look like a delicious   ?  According to the study, the sugar industry would go on to spend the equivalent of $5. 3 million in 2016 dollars on their campaign to get Americans to replace fat calories with calories from sugar. “At last people who never had a course in biochemistry are going to learn that sugar is what keeps every human being alive and with energy to face our daily problems,” Hass said. But Dr. Donald Hensrud, Medical Director of the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program, told BuzzFeed Health that we shouldn’t exonerate saturated fats completely, because they do play some role in heart disease. It’s just that scientists now understand that the impact of saturated fat on heart health is more complex than we previously thought. For example, we now know that cholesterol levels are strongly influenced by genetics. And Hensrud explained that while moderate consumption of saturated fats in an otherwise healthy and balanced diet is probably fine for many people, a diet heavy in the saturated fats found in red meat and dairy to the exclusion of   fats (i. e. the unsaturated fats in avocados, nuts, nut butters, etc.) would not be good for your cholesterol. The mingling of food industry interests with scientific research seriously undermines public health, says Nestle: “Food company sponsorship, whether or not intentionally manipulative, undermines public trust in nutrition science, contributes to public confusion about what to eat, and compromises Dietary Guidelines in ways that are not in the best interest of public health. ” When BuzzFeed Health asked Dr. Yoni Freedhoff, assistant professor of family medicine at the University of Ottawa to explain this, he said that “Recent research indeed points to the opposite finding. ” Hensrud told BuzzFeed Health via email that the “relationship between sugar consumption and increased heart disease has become clearer over the years. ” He pointed to a 2014 study that the American Heart Association cites as the foundation of their sugar recommendations which “observed a significant relationship between added sugar consumption and increased risk for cardiovascular disease mortality. ”   "

","’Read the order:’] A federal judge in Texas has blocked the Obama administration’s federal policies protecting transgender students and workers, issuing a nationwide injunction against enforcement of the policies regarding restroom use. U. S. District Court Judge Reed O’Connor in Fort Worth issued the order sought by Texas and 10 other states on Sunday. The states sued the Obama administration in May over its guidelines regarding accommodating transgender students in restrooms and facilities at public schools. The 11 states had asked O’Connor to suspend Obama’s policies  —   largely an interpretation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972  —   in a hearing held on Aug. 12. “Defendants have conspired to turn workplaces and educational settings across the country into laboratories for a massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights,” the states’ complaint stated. In his   order, O’Connor ruled that the states had standing to bring their lawsuit because the administration’s “Guidelines are clearly designed to target [their] conduct. ” The court found that the Obama administration’s actions likely violate the Administrative Procedure Act for failing to follow proper notice and comment procedures under the law because, the court found, the policies are “legislative and substantive. ” Additionally, the court found that, under the text of the law, the Obama administration’s interpretation is incorrect  —   a ruling that contradicts an earlier decision from the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in a related case challenging a Virginia school district’s policies. While the administration argued that the guidance is allowed because the use of the word “sex” in regulations implementing Title IX is ambiguous, O’Connor disagreed. “[T]he Court concludes § 106. 33 is not ambiguous,” he wrote. “It cannot be disputed that the plain meaning of the term sex as used in § 106. 33 when it was enacted by DOE following passage of Title IX meant the biological and anatomical differences between male and female students as determined at their birth. ” Of the administration’s guidance purporting to change that “plain meaning,” then, he added: “A definition that confuses instead of clarifies is unpersuasive”  —   citing the judge who dissented from the 4th Circuit’s decision for support. In granting the states’ request, O’Connor issued a nationwide injunction of the guidance, writing that “while this injunction remains in place, [the Obama administration is] enjoined from initiating, continuing, or concluding any investigation based on [its] interpretation that the definition of sex includes gender identity in Title IX’s prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex. ” O’Connor also ordered that the administration not use the guidelines or claim that they “carry weight in any litigation initiated following the date of this Order. ” “The department is disappointed in the court’s decision, and we are reviewing our options,” Justice Department press secretary Dena Iverson told BuzzFeed News. Although Iverson would not signal either way, the administration is expected to appeal. Paul Castillo, a   lawyer with that LGBT advocacy group Lambda Legal, told BuzzFeed News he believes an appeal is “widely expected. ”In the short term, Castillo thinks the injunction will prevent federal officials from threatening to withhold federal education funds from schools that ban transgender students that match their gender identity. However, he added, “It will not prevent private attorneys, such as Lambda Legal and the ACLU, from representing transgender students by bringing cases against schools that discriminate against them. ” He said other LGBT groups could file lawsuits as well.

"," SANTIAGO DE CUBA, CUBA  —   Marta Jacobs Infante and her young daughter were among many in Santiago de Cuba anxiously awaiting the arrival of a military convoy carrying the ashes of Fidel Castro, their late president, on Saturday morning. “The death of Fidel is a very significative moment in the life of every Cuban person because he has been part of our history, of our development as a country,” said Jacobs Infante, 37, sitting on a   couch in her airy, sage green living room. Daniela, 6, sat eating a banana by her mother’s side. “He made a lot of good things for his people,” Jacobs Infante said. “I think every one of us has something to be grateful for. ” Castro’s ashes were scheduled to arrive in Santiago, the southeastern city where Fidel declared his socialist revolution was victorious in 1959, on Saturday afternoon after a   journey across the country from Havana, where he died at age 90 last weekend. His funeral is scheduled for Sunday morning following a gathering at Santiago’s Antonio Maceo Revolution Square the night before. Jacobs Infante said she was thankful to Castro for the fact that she was able to go to university for free and have a career as a teacher. Now she rents her home, nestled on a small street in central Santiago, to visitors. This weekend, a French journalist covering Castro’s funeral was staying with her. “We live in a free country,” she said. “We don’t have violence. Our children can live in our country without being in danger of being killed or kidnapped or anything like that. We are most of all free and we are most of all healthy and educated because of what he did. ” Castro implemented a socialist agenda that included greater access to education and health care, but he also clung to power for nearly 50 years, jailing political dissidents and stifling free speech. Some critics, including Cubans who have fled the country, celebrated his death. Many   took to the streets in Miami to herald the demise of the man they viewed as a dictator. “That’s politics,” Jacobs Infante said. “It’s true that maybe there are people that are not agree with the way he made socialism in Cuba. ” “I have the freedom to express myself because I don’t have the wrong expression, the wrong thoughts about the revolution,” she said. The country has been in an official state of mourning since Castro’s death. Freshly painted signs and greetings praising “el Commandante” can be seen along the roads where his ashes will pass. Cuban television has shown   coverage of the longtime president’s life, death, and voyage to his final resting place. The constant talk about Fidel, as he’s commonly referred to by Cubans, prompted a curious Daniela, who’s been asking about who he was and what’s happening, to write him a letter on Friday, her mother said. “Fidel, I love you with all my heart,” the letter read in Spanish. “Fidel, you are our commander in chief. ” Jacobs Infante said she and her neighbors would be going to watch the caravan pass through the city’s winding narrow roads. Daniela wore a red and black armband with “26 Julio” written on it, a reference to the day the Cuban revolution is said to have begun. “This is a historic moment,” Jacobs Infante said, smiling. “This is a moment that won’t be repeated in our history in a long time. So when I’m old, I will say to my grandchild, ‘I went there when Fidel died. ’”  "

"," NEW YORK  —   A former state retirement fund manager is accused of receiving bribes that included prostitutes, cash, cocaine, an expensive watch, and even tickets to see Paul McCartney and the US Open in exchange for steering more than $2 billion to two brokerage firms, according to an indictment unsealed in federal court Wednesday. Navnoor Kang, 38, the former director of Fixed Income and Head of Portfolio Strategy for the $184 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund (NYSCRF) is charged along with brokers Deborah Kelley, 58, and Gregg Schonhorn, 45, for allegedly taking part in the scheme. Federal prosecutors say that from 2014 to 2015, Kang received more than $100, 000 in bribes, while Kelley and Schonhorn made millions in commission from getting the business. They then allegedly tried to cover up their actions by coordinating false testimony and hiding evidence, and intimidating a witness. The New York comptroller’s office, which runs the retirement fund, told the Associated Press it is “outraged” by Kang’s “shocking betrayal of his responsibilities. ” He was dismissed from NYSCRF in February. On two occasions in 2014, authorities say Schonhorn picked up a $  for Kang and an associate to take trips to Montreal, where they allegedly got bottle service and cocaine while out on the town. That same year, Kelley allegedly paid for a   trip for Kang to New Orleans and tickets to Paul McCartney concert. By the fall of 2014, authorities say Schonhorn was also regularly bribing Kang in New York with trips to strip clubs, upscale dinners, tickets to Broadway shows and the US Open tennis tournament, along with providing crack and cocaine. Kang allegedly told Schonhorn and Kelley that entertainment benefits were illegal at his office and the brokers could not disclose any of it on their expense reports. However, according to the indictment, Kelley attempted to expense the New Orleans trip but left Kang’s name out of the report. Then in 2015, Kelley paid for a ski trip for Kang and his   to Park City, Utah, and attempted once again to expense the costs while excluding his name, prosecutors allege. Later that year, Schonhorn purchased Kang a $17, 000 Panerai wristwatch, according to the indictment. Meanwhile, the NYSCRF’s business with Schonhorn and Kelley’s brokerage firms grew exponentially. By March 2016, prosecutors say Kang was steering more than $2. 3 billion to Schonhorn and $179 million to Kelley in retirement bond business. The trio are also charged with obstruction of justice in the case. After they were subpoenaed in late 2015, Kang and Kelley allegedly agreed to sync their stories and give false testimony. Kelley testified that she had not paid for any of Kang’s Park City ski trip, with the exception of certain small expenses that Kang repaid her for. Kang said he believed his girlfriend had repaid Kelly for the trip. After he was subpoenaed, authorities say Kang called Schonhorn and told him he was in trouble and asked if he knew anyone who could fabricate receipts. Schonhorn allegedly advised Kang to tell his girlfriend to give Kelley a check to cover the cost of the trip and make it seem like she had forgotten to pay her earlier. However, the woman refused. In July 2016, Schonhorn began cooperating with authorities and agreed to record his meetings with Kang. At one meeting, Kang asked Schonhorn to lie about the dinners, US Open tickets, and his interactions with his girlfriend. At another, Kang returned the wristwatch and informed Schonhorn that he had hidden some evidence. “Today, we allege a classic, quid pro quo bribery scheme at the New York State Common Retirement Fund, the third largest pension fund in the country,” US Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement announcing the charges. “The   pension savings of New Yorkers should never serve as a vehicle for corrupt, personal enrichment. The intersection of public corruption and securities fraud appears to be a busy one, but it’s one that we are committed to policing. ” Kang’s attorney told the Associated Press that he will fight the charges in court.

","Last night, Meryl Streep gave an impassioned,   political speech that encapsulated most of what I hate about Hollywood liberalism. Streep had just received the Cecile B. DeMille Award at the Golden Globes, and she used the opportunity to launch a direct frontal attack on Donald Trump. You can watch it here: At tonight’s #GoldenGlobes we honor Hollywood legend Meryl Streep with the prestigious Cecil B. Demille Award. pic. twitter.  I have no particular affection for Trump, but I positively loathe the condescension, alarmism, ignorance, and   of the wealthy Hollywood Left, and each of those elements was on full display in Streep’s speech. Condescension? Not content to take a shot at Trump for apparently insulting a disabled reporter, she made the puzzling statement that the insult was designed to get his audience to “show their teeth”  —   dehumanizing language that would outrage her if applied to anyone other than Trump’s crowd of Republicans. Moreover, does she not understand the deficiencies of her chosen candidate? Does she not know that many millions voted for Trump in spite of his personal attacks and not because they love his insults? Ignorance? Streep claimed that once America kicks out “outsiders and foreigners,” we’ll be left with nothing but football and mixed martial arts to entertain us. Quelle horreur! But the MMA world would be nothing without its foreign fighters and champions. Look at the list. You see men and women from across the globe. As for “outsiders,” for every Hollywood actor with a tough upbringing, there are 50 NFL athletes who came from nothing to achieve athletic greatness. And that brings us to the   the staggering  . Streep firmly and fully believes that she and her colleagues are on the side of the angels, standing bravely against the “bullies” who would degrade our culture and denigrate our citizens. Yet it is the cultural Left that has raised bullying to an art form, commandeering immensely powerful institutions to exact vengeance on those who dissent from leftist orthodoxy. Even while Streep was still speaking, conservative Twitter sparked to life, making all these critiques and more. Yet there was one sentiment that I thought was misplaced, a dash of triumphalism that rang hollow. “This is why Trump won,” said some. “Keep talking like this, and Trump wins again,” said others. In the narrow political sense, there’s some truth to this. Lots of voters don’t like to be hectored. Lots of voters defy Hollywood’s commands. Indeed, since 1968  —   when the modern Left really got rolling  —   the Democratic party has been largely losing ground. It’s lost most presidential races, it’s lost its stranglehold on the House of Representatives, it has lost the Senate, and now its fortunes in the states are at a low ebb. For all their celebrity star power, the Democrats are the weakest they’ve been in generations. But in that same period, whose cultural values have most advanced? The secular Left has taken a sledgehammer to God, family, and country  —   the pillars of our national culture  —   and Hollywood has led the way. American irreligiosity is rising, the family (especially in our most vulnerable communities) is collapsing, and generations of children are now raised to view their nation not as a flawed but indispensable beacon of freedom but rather as a bigoted oppressor, an instrument of evil across the globe. In fact, it’s strange to even think of Trump as somehow a triumph over Hollywood. In many ways, he is Hollywood  —   a towering celebrity who has exhibited and lived exactly the personal values that fill the pages of People magazine and Us Weekly. To “beat” Hollywood, the GOP turned to Hollywood. It can mock celebrity culture no longer. Hollywood sells the best cultural drugs. Truth is optional,   is a virtue, and bullying is bravery. And last night it was all wrapped in Streep’s alluring package, an   call to arms that stirred the hearts of millions. More The Left The Centrist History of Medicaid Spending   Histrionics on the LeftBipartisan Agreement on Health Care Masks a Deep DivideOver the long sweep of history, what matters more? Donald Trump’s immigration policy or the fate of the family? Paul Ryan’s entitlement reforms or the faith of a nation? The fate of the family and the faith of the nation narrow and constrain our politics, limiting our choices to those options that are palatable to an increasingly dependent people. Hollywood is helping redefine our nation’s character. And if the Left keeps winning our culture, the GOP can keep winning our politics and the nation will still lose. So laugh all you want at Streep, conservatives. When it comes to the things that truly matter, she’s winning, we’re losing, and Donald Trump isn’t going to turn the tide.,"
75576,115623,"Sex, Be Not Proud",National Review,NR Interview,2017-03-03,2017.0,3.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/445435/gender-identity-ashley-mcguire-new-book-men-and-women
","‘The willful blindness to basic biological difference under the mantra of equality ultimately disempowers women,” Ashley McGuire writes in her new book, Sex Scandal: The Drive to Abolish Male and Female. “When we deny sex,” she writes, “we cast ourselves into the most brute state of nature: a battle of strengths that pits men and women against each other as rivals and enemies. ” Kathryn Jean Lopez: How exactly are we scared of sex? Ashley McGuire: We have become afraid of something that has been obvious since time immemorial, namely that we are either male or female. It is not an exaggeration to say that in certain quarters (college campuses being an obvious one) that truth has become an offensive statement. There have even been attempts to pass laws that would make it a   violation to say as much. Society is increasingly scandalized by two concepts: 1) that our sex is established (from conception, no less) and 2) that it entails differences that are important and often immutable. McGuire: Women have the most to lose in a world that denies sexual difference, or that denies sex as a category outright. For starters, women cannot make claims on the basis of their sex, such as workplace discrimination, if sex is not a legitimate category to begin with. This is where you will see radical feminists lining up alongside social conservatives in expressing concern about the   movement. But as I argue in my book, when we talk about a “gender neutral” society and make such a society our cultural ideal, we wind up defaulting to a world where the male stereotype becomes the baseline for measuring equality and rights. For example, women are only equal with men in the military if they can serve in combat roles, which assumes that macho strength is what makes a good solider. Women are not equal with men unless they can eradicate their fertility through contraception and abortion, which assumes the   male body as the paradigm. We even have a pill now, female Viagra, to help women perform sexually more like a man. Rather than force society to recognize and adjust to what makes women unique, we just tip the needle more in the male direction. Lopez: Why should men  —   who aren’t exactly   as it is  —   care about this? What right do they have to intervene? McGuire: Men are also in a very difficult position in a world that denies sex difference. As I point out in the introduction, men can’t really win. If they do something chivalrous, they are patronizing if they don’t, they are chauvinists. But I argue in the book that men and women help each other to be our better selves. For example, women help draw virtue out of men by requiring them to subvert and channel their desires and strengths in heroic ways. Lopez: Is the Midwife Alliance of North America (MANA) really calling pregnant women “birthing individuals”? And is this really something that should disturb us? McGuire: Yes, and yes. ​​ One author decried the blowback that MANA received for this statement, lamenting the fact that some women had the audacity to “assert that only women have the ability to give birth, and that such capacity is what women should celebrate about themselves. ” How dare we! And this is not an isolated incident. Just a week or two ago, the British Medical Association published a leaflet encouraging people to use the phrase “pregnant people” in lieu of “expectant mother” and “chestfeeding” instead of “breastfeeding” in order to be more “inclusive. ” This example perfectly illustrates the thesis of my book: that in the quest to be gender neutral, we end up erasing woman. What we wind up devaluing is the uniquely female contribution, including the most patently obvious contribution of bearing and birthing children. Lopez: Why does Fifty Shades of Gray bother you so much? The movie makes it into the first full page of your introduction! McGuire: I think the popularity of Fifty Shades  —   and especially the fact that two of its movie adaptations were released on Valentine’s Day weekend  —   really sums up what happens to romance in a “ ” society. We wind up with the basest stereotype of male sexuality exalted as romantic, even when that sexuality is forced on women. Romance and chivalry (and even consent) start to disappear quickly in a world that tells men and women that women should be treated exactly like men. Sex, as we see in Fifty Shades, starts to take on an aggressive and even violent theme. It’s the exact opposite of what women are looking for in a relationship. Lopez: Would you want to turn back the clock on women in the military? McGuire: No! In fact, there is so much room to rethink  —   not just in the military, but in so many different career paths  —   how we can use the unique talents of women without forcing them into a male model that sets them up to fail. One of the things I keep hearing in conversations with members of our armed forces is that women are often hitting their professional stride in the military right as they are entering their peak childbearing years, as well as that it is hard to advance in the ranks without combat experience. The military has already instituted different physical standards for men and women. Can they do the same thing with the way men and women advance in the ranks? Because their approach of telling, say, female midshipmen they can no longer wear their skirts, or telling   moms they can freeze their eggs to climb the ranks, or sending women into combat when we know they are less likely to survive without injury, doesn’t cut it. Lopez: How have universities and colleges, as you write, “become the primary engines behind making sexual difference scandalous”? McGuire: Women’  and   departments have, for decades, been pushing the notion that our maleness and femaleness are socialized and that gender is a social construct invented by the patriarchy to oppress women. They have been arguing that women need to liberate themselves from these social constructs in order to attain equality with men. I argue in the book that they undercut themselves from the   when they use masculine standards as the baselines for measuring equality  —   such as when the   male body and the male model of breadwinner who works   are held up as the ideals. And here we are in 2017 celebrating abortion and the fact that four in ten households are run by single women. Furthermore, colleges and universities have been experimenting with forced sexual integration since long before the rest of us were paying close attention. I think   dorms, bathrooms, and now increasingly, dorm rooms are the perfect example. This is an acceptable arrangement if the sexes really are no different. And yet we know that something like   of assaults happen in campus housing. But schools have tied their own hands when it comes to doing anything about it when their own writing centers are publishing guidelines suggesting that even grammar doesn’t apply when it comes to the differences between men and women! Lopez: And yet you write that “social conservatives and radical feminists increasingly line up together. ” What could be some   efforts for the common good? McGuire: I think the common ground here is the shared concern over how to handle the issues of violence against women, trafficking, pornography, and actual discrimination when sex is redefined to mean nothing. We saw this when a senior official at the ACLU, a mother, resigned over her concern about allowing men access to women’s bathrooms. I also document this common ground in my interview with   feminist Kathleen Sloan, who told me about her friend who runs a   center in Canada that was forced to appeal to the highest court in the country to defend its right to preserve itself as a safe space for women. And we can see this on full display at a panel held recently at the Heritage Foundation with feminists across the spectrum, all in agreement with the statement that “biology is not bigotry. ” All of the panelists argued that women lose when we cannot make claims on the basis of our sex, because we women are uniquely prone to being the victim of certain evils such as rape. Lopez: What’s the most important lesson you’ve learned as a wife and mother? McGuire: I have been most struck as a mother by just how early children begin to understand their identity through the lens of their maleness or femaleness. I marvel at the clarity with which my daughter, for example, can see the things that our society is trying to muddle. As a wife, I’ve found that marital happiness is often found in doing the opposite of what our society tells me to do. I’m not going to sit down and make sure that my husband and I have a 50 —  50 split of chores and childcare in a given week, and I am not going to quantify my contribution in our home based on whether our paychecks are the same. We know that women want very different things than men, but we first have to free ourselves from society’s insistence that we live our adult married lives exactly as our husbands do in order to be equal with them. Modeling that freedom and happiness to my children is what I strive for. [Read more from our interview here. ],"

","Why can’t the Geico Gecko sell health insurance from coast to coast? 	As President Donald J. Trump and congressional Republicans labor to repeal and replace Obamacare, they should demolish America’s current maze of     fiefdoms and replace it with a truly national market for health coverage. 	Also,   insurance commissioners behave like border guards who decide which insurers can and cannot enter their jurisdictions. These regulators often demand that all health plans in their states cover     items, such as acupuncture, marriage counseling, in vitro fertilization, and other mandated benefits. Like obligatory sunroofs on all cars, such   requirements drive health premiums into the sky. 	As part of repealing and replacing Obamacare, President Trump and other leading Republicans have promised to let Americans buy health coverage across state lines. A New Yorker, for example, could purchase a plan from, say, Arizona, with just the right blend of benefits, restrictions, and prices. 	That alone would be a great start. But why stop there? 	Here is a far better idea: Obliterate these lines altogether. 	Beyond buying plan X from North Carolina or plan Y from Texas, why not liberate insurers to sell in all 50 states at once? Imagine having multiple plans with assorted benefits on sale everywhere in America. 	This ultimate system of patient power and consumer choice would unleash the kind of competition that would stimulate innovation in this moribund industry. As a higher number of insurers vie for each patient’s business, this would lower overall costs. Conversely, the “Affordable” Care Act is propelling a 25 percent hike in typical premiums, this year alone. 	Also, creating large customer bases from across the entire country would spread the risk of insuring Americans with   conditions. Covering a diabetic is a smaller gamble within a national market’s bigger, healthier population than among a smaller pool of   consumers, especially in such lightly inhabited places as Idaho, North Dakota, or Vermont. While a national   market is not the only solution, it would help address the nettlesome, and vital, challenge of covering those with existing ailments. 	How might this idea fare in America’s 50 state capitals? 	“State insurance commissioners won’t like it,” Forbes’s Avik Roy, M. D. recently predicted, “because it decreases their power when insurers can relocate. ” 	Too bad.   insurocrats have thrived mightily since the   Act of 1945 turbocharged their powers to oversee insurance. 	Congress should use the U. S. Constitution’s Interstate Commerce Clause to terminate these officials’ veto power over which health insurers can enter their territories. Promoting the general welfare of all Americans, Congress should uproot these      cartels and, instead, let a national   market bloom. 	“I’m a big fan of more competition rather than less, as our current markets are usually one or two providers and verging on monopoly instead of pure competition,” said Representative Dave Brat (R. Va. ). “The standard textbook model predicts that more competition gets you lower prices, better quality, more variety, and better service. That is the theory which we all know has worked in this country for over 200 years. ” 	Cato Institute   scholar Michael Cannon already is thinking beyond America’s borders. He wonders: “Why not international health insurance?” Why not, indeed? If France’s AXA, Germany’s Allianz, or Japan’s Nippon Life Insurance wants to provide health plans to American patients, come on down! 	Until then, the Geico Gecko sells automobile, apartment, and flood insurance throughout the land. “The Rock” of Prudential markets life and disability policies from the Golden Gate to the Brooklyn Bridge. Freeing them and new players to offer medical coverage nationwide would be an important and welcome way to make health insurance great again.,"

","Annie Dookhan is not the first. She will not be the last. 	Dookhan, who in 2013 pleaded guilty to 27 criminal counts involving obstruction of justice and tampering with evidence, was a chemist employed by Massachusetts to test evidence in drug cases. She was involved in thousands of them, and she routinely falsified evidence. For example, she declared samples positive for drugs without testing them and forged colleagues’ signatures on reports. On Wednesday, Massachusetts announced that it was obliged to throw out 21, 587 drug convictions secured with questionable evidence. 	In the 1990s, Dr. Ralph Erdmann, a highly paid pathologist working for Lubbock County, Texas, ran into a spot of trouble: At one point he had misplaced a human head, and in one autopsy report he duly recorded the condition of the spleen of a man who did not have one. He kept blood samples in his home refrigerator, next to the mustard. He was eventually convicted of a raft of felonies involving evidence tampering and perjury. Local lawyers insisted that he was cooperating with the district attorney and providing whatever evidence was needed to produce a conviction. His tainted evidence helped produce convictions in at least 20 capital murder cases. 	Dookhan received a sentence of three to five years and was shortly thereafter paroled. Gilchrist was never charged with a crime. Erdmann was sentenced to community service he later was imprisoned on weapons charges and served two years. We go pretty easy on these kinds of crimes. We shouldn’t. 	This is a moral problem, but too often our moral insistence that this sort of thing simply should not happen blinds us to the fact that it does happen, consistently, and that we need to take prophylactic measures against it. 	Consider, for a moment, the very popular idea of   welfare recipients. There is very little evidence that this produces lower rates of drug use on the part of welfare recipients, and no evidence at all that it lowers welfare caseloads  —   much less that it does so in a way that offsets or more than offsets the cost of the drug testing. It might conceivably have some effect on casual recreational drug users, but as anybody who ever has worked with   addicts knows, they will give up a great deal (jobs, custody of their children, marriages,  ) in the service of their addictions. We would be far more likely to reduce welfare dependency by treating addiction than to reduce addiction by restricting welfare dependency. But the desire to punish is a permanent part of the human outlook, and it has its own demands. 	Why not test police and prosecutors instead? 	Not for drug use. We would be far better off applying a similar idea in the matter of criminal cases by having independent third parties randomly retest DNA samples, drugs, and other physical evidence in felony cases. Erdmann’s autopsy reports were not only falsified  —   in many cases, he apparently did not perform the autopsy at all. Dookhan’s work similarly would have been exposed by ordinary oversight measures that are routine in other settings. We do not need Sherlock Holmes to root out this sort of wrongdoing. We only need basic responsible action. 	Expensive? Surely. But not nearly so expensive as retrying 21, 587 felony cases linked to a single chemist or making restitution for wrongful convictions. Difficult and problematic? No doubt, but not nearly so troubling as the possibility of wrongly convicting innocent people  —   or, as the wiser among us will appreciate, of convicting guilty people on bad evidence. It may very well have been the case that every man and woman Erdmann sent to death row was 100 percent guilty as charged properly understood, that question is irrelevant to the issue of falsifying evidence and other forms of misconduct on the part of prosecutors and their colleagues. A bogus trial that produces the right result is still a bogus trial. 	And it is expensive to have bogus trials. 	Not only because of the obvious costs involved in reopening cases or making   payments to those wrongly convicted, but because a liberal society runs on trust. Trust in institutions is the lubricant that permits the machinery of an open society to run. We ought to be routinely reexamining the work of prosecutors and police officers in a systematic and regular way not because we expect to find widespread abuse and misconduct but because we do not expect to find them. 	Trust has to be earned. 	In the 1950s, outlaw motorcycle gangs briefly became a subject of national fascination, owing in part to Marlon Brando’s performance in The Wild One. (Hunter S. Thompson’s later exploration of the subject in Hells Angels was his best work.) A representative of the American Motorcycle Association is supposed to have remarked that 99 percent of all motorcyclists were decent,   citizens. Since that time, outlaw motorcyclists have proudly worn a patch reading: “1%. ” 	Outlaw prosecutors, outlaw coroners, and outlaw chemists do not wear any such patch. And they probably don’t even amount to 1 percent of the people with whom we entrust the enforcement of our laws and the administration of justice. But they are there. 	What are we going to do about that?,"
76335,116540,Leave Jimmy Fallon Alone,National Review,David French,2017-05-17,2017.0,5.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/447721/jimmy-fallon-bucks-resistance
","Over the long term, the politicization of everything is a greater threat to American national life than any single politician  —   including Donald Trump or any candidate the Democrats nominate to challenge him in 2020. If there is no place for common engagement or common enjoyment, then we face more polarization. And make no mistake, polarization can’t continue to worsen indefinitely without placing dangerous strains on the union itself. 	And that brings me, of course, to Jimmy Fallon. Yes, this guy: 	Fallon, you see, is under fire for not using his   show as an arm of the #Resistance. Sure, he pokes fun at Trump, but he was famously relatively kind to Trump when Trump appeared on his show last September. He’s far less political than, say, Stephen Colbert, and when he is political, he’s far less biting. 	And now it turns out that Fallon’s relatively apolitical stance may actually be costing him  —   not just elite regard but his place in the ratings. Colbert has closed the gap. Today the New York Times published a long piece exploring Fallon’s response to Trump, his modest ratings slump (the show is still profitable) and whether he intends to change. Here’s how Times culture reporter Dave Itzkoff frames Fallon’s challenge: 		He is weathering the most tumultuous period in his tenure there  —   a predicament for which he has himself to thank, and one that raises the question of whether the multitalented but apolitical Mr. Fallon can ride out the current era of politicized,    entertainment, when he just wants to have a good time. 	The one phrase I’d challenge is Itzkoff’s statement that Fallon “has himself to thank” for the tumult. While, yes, an entertainer is responsible for knowing their audience, an audience makes choices as well, and audiences are choosing polarization. Fallon, however, is not  —   at least not so far: 		As strongly as ever, Mr. Fallon believes it should be a place for a wide swath of viewers to get their entertainment and laughs, and that this philosophy will steer it through a period of intense polarization. 		“I don’t want to be bullied into not being me, and not doing what I think is funny,” he said more defiantly. “Just because some people bash me on Twitter, it’s not going to change my humor or my show. ” 	As he says, “People who voted for Trump watch my show as well. ” Yes, of course they do, and the fact that Fallon doesn’t seize that opportunity to browbeat them with insults and mockery is to his enduring moral credit. 	Yes, moral. As I wrote in my print cover story about The Rock, there is a valuable place for sheer fun, for a good laugh, for solid entertainment. This is a positive good in the life of a country (not to mention in our personal lives as well). It has a tempering effect. It keeps from driving us to extremes. It serves as a pressure valve from the stresses of the day and the antagonisms of the time. 	A good laugh. Beautiful music. A great game. These are things that we can all enjoy. The other day, a friend forwarded me the extended LeBron James Nike commercial, released when he returned to Cleveland after his heartbreaking departure to Miami. Yes, it’s overwrought. Yes, it’s too grandiose. But it still captures a shared cultural experience (at least in one city) that politics will never, ever give us: 	But if the cost of a laugh is enduring spiteful mockery, or if the music is preceded by a political screed, or if sports is inflicting a dose of disrespect right alongside the dunks and   then the joy fades. The vengeance and anger remain. 	There are those who look at this trend with immense satisfaction. Politics is So Important that all else  —   fame, talent, athleticism  —   fades in comparison to commitments to social justice or individual liberty. But hidden behind this alleged altruism is often a healthy dose of ego  —   that talent and athleticism have made the entertainer or athlete So Important that we need to hear what they believe. 	No. We do not. Their jump shot might place them in the world’s elite. Their comedic timing and individual creativity may make them a matchless performer. Their political speech brings them right down with the rest of us, in the muck and mire of unending political conflict.

","If you keep up with the news, you might think that the unpleasant and unedifying 2016 presidential campaign is still going on. 	President Donald Trump, up early, is sending out tweets coarsely attacking foreign leaders and American politicians  —   complete with misspelled words, in at least one case to the point of indecipherability. 	Charitably minded observers may excuse both of these individuals, neither of whom expected twelve months ago to be in the places and positions they are today. And they might add that they’re not the only ones continuing to operate in campaign mode. 	Rush Limbaugh proclaims that “American voters saved this country as we know it. ” Or, to be more precise, the 46 percent of American voters responsible for securing 304 electoral votes for Trump did. 	But America has rebounded from policy mistakes  —   you can make your own list  —   before. Every election has policy consequences, some of them pretty serious and many unpredictable. The country has evolved, changed, grown enormously, but much of its character remains recognizable in the writings of Alexis de Tocqueville, who interviewed the rival presidents John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson   years ago. 	On the other side, 43 percent of respondents to a   Consult poll want Congress to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump. Over half of those people  —   23 percent of respondents  —   think he has proved “he is unfit to serve and should be removed from office, regardless of whether he committed an impeachable offense or not. ” 	So to heck with the Constitution and its nitpicking requirement that officials be removed from office only for “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. ” These folks want a revote, right now. For them, the campaign is still on  —   as it may still be for the next 17 months, if in 2018 Democratic House candidates make impeachment a main plank of their platforms. 	Amid the continuing campaign chatter, let’s step back and ponder how current events will be regarded in the longer run of history. 	Trump’s capture of 70 previously Democratic electoral votes in the Midwest and Pennsylvania owes much to his distinctive stands on immigration and trade, even though the problems he cited are of declining importance. Illegal immigration across the Mexican border fell off sharply in 2007, and the reduction in American jobs because of Chinese imports probably crested several years before. 	That positions him as president to claim credit for trends that are ongoing, albeit his policies are arguably accelerating them. Illegal border crossings are apparently way down this year, probably in response to Trump’s strengthened enforcement of existing laws. Manufacturing jobs may be rising, too, as rising Chinese wages make Chinese goods less competitive here. 	On foreign policy, Trump has abandoned Barack Obama’s tilt to Iran (Obama had a secret back channel with Iran, dating back to the 2008 campaign) and stitched together an informal   coalition in the Middle East. He may have persuaded China to exert some discipline over North Korea and has accelerated the     program, derided for years by Democrats, to protect America from any Kim   nukes. 	As for Europe, he and German chancellor Angela Merkel both have benefited politically from trading news conference and Twitter insults. Merkel is strengthened for her September 24 election, and Trump can claim to have spurred Europeans to take more responsibility for their own defense. 	This is starting to look like a more conventional Republican foreign policy than campaign rhetoric suggested. Congressional Democrats seem to have stalled in their efforts to find some Team Trump collusion with Russia that would justify the impeachment proceedings their party’s base expects and lusts for  —   perhaps because an investigation could show that the Obama administration surveilled and criminally unmasked Americans for political reasons. 	I’m happy to join those urging Trump and Clinton to stop acting like candidates. But maybe the rest of us should take a deep breath and stop acting as if the campaign were still on.,"
76944,117259,Trade Restrictions and Closed Borders Are Reminiscent of the 1930s,National Review,Michael Barone,2016-01-05,2016.0,1.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/429223/trade-restrictions-closed-borders-1930
","Battening down the hatches. That’s what America and much of the rest of the world seem to be doing today, in an eerie   though to much less of a degree, of what America and the world did in the 1930s. The result then wasn’t very pretty. The result now is unknown. One way the hatches are being battened down is that the volume of world trade has been declining, and not just temporarily, in response to the financial crisis of fall 2008. But in a broader perspective, greater trade produces greater productivity and growth. “International shipments broaden the pool of customers for a given product,” writes the Wall Street Journal’s William Mauldin, “and enhance competition and specialization, cutting prices for consumers. ” Go to your local   or one of its competitors and you will see the effect. Prices for clothing and food have tended to decline over the last 40 years, something American consumers may take for granted, but which they may come to miss if trade flows stagnate. And that may be happening. International trade dropped sharply after the financial crisis in 2008, rebounded in 2010, but has grown only about 3 percent a year since, compared to a 6 percent annual rate from 1983 to 2008. In that period world trade grew faster than the world economy as a whole. Now it is growing slower. That’s reminiscent of something far more drastic that happened in the early 1930s. As the famous spiral graph of economic historian Charles Kindleberger shows, world trade volumes declined by 67 percent between January 1929 and March 1933. That was almost double the 38 percent decline in world production. This decline was exacerbated by trade restrictions, starting with the United States’   Tariff Act of 1930, which inspired higher tariffs and trade barriers in Europe and elsewhere. Nations trying to protect themselves from harm hurt the world as a whole  —   and themselves. RELATED: Zero Inflation Is Holding the Economy Together  —   Free Trade Will Give It a Strong Boost, So it’s a little chilling to see that the poll leaders for both parties’ presidential nominations  —   Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton  —   are opposing the   trade agreement negotiated by the Obama administration. And that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has withdrawn it for the next year from consideration in the Senate, the house of Congress usually more amenable to free trade. Meanwhile, negotiations for a   trade agreement have not reached fruition. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Another factor is at work: a sharp slowdown in China’s growth rates, to what level, no one is sure. From 1982 to 2008 China’s   annual growth rate helped power world economic growth, lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty there and providing increasingly inexpensive consumer goods and   products in advanced countries. For the Chinese, that growth rate restores China to its natural position as a great economic power, after an unpleasant   interval of rebellion, revolution, civil war, and Communist oppression. For the world, it has been a boost to growth whose magnitude is unlikely ever to be replicated. RELATED: Where There Is No Border, the Nations Perish, The prospect of stagnant world trade and growing trade barriers may be cheered by those who think that will bring back the auto assembly plants of the 1960s. But battening down the hatches tends to make the air inside stale and to hinder the ship from moving forward. A similar phenomenon may be happening: tightening of the borders. Some of this is necessary and beneficial. There is no reason to tolerate mass   illegal immigration (which in fact has vastly diminished, down toward zero in the case of Mexico, since 2007). More Free Trade   Central Planning Is as Foolish as   Central Planning. Businesses Dislike Competition: Boeing vs. Bombardier EditionGerman MisadventuresAnd there are good reasons to be especially watchful about Muslims seeking visas or green cards, given the significant amount (though low percentage) of terrorists who are likely to be in their numbers. This is not nativism or bigotry but common sense. But tightening the borders has already reduced the flow of visiting students and tourists  —   not a good thing. Neither is our politicians’ inability to encourage more   immigration. These developments, again, are not nearly as dire as the situation in the 1930s, when immigration was close to zero and we blocked the entry of most Jewish and political refugees from   Europe. That decade was brought to a close by world war. Let’s hope that battening down the hatches today doesn’t come to a similar end.,"

","According to conventional wisdom, the GOP nominates the guy whose turn it is, while the Democrats look for a savior. As Bill Clinton once said, “In every presidential election, Democrats want to fall in love. Republicans just fall in line. ” George H. W. Bush came in second to Ronald Reagan in 1980. As the sitting vice president, it was Bush’s turn for the nomination in 1988, and he got it. Senator Bob Dole came in second to Bush in 1988, so in 1996 it was his turn. In 2000, there was no obvious line of succession, but George W. Bush came closest as the heir to the Bush dynasty. Senator John McCain came in second to W. in 2000. In 2008, McCain got the nomination. Mitt Romney: Second in 2008, he got his turn in 2012. On the Republican side, however, the conventional wisdom is dead. The   establishment GOP candidates look like they’re   the fight scene in the movie Anchorman, attacking one another at every turn. What’s going on? In the GOP race, the real culprit isn’t Donald Trump, it’s Jeb Bush. Each more or less had the establishment or moderate wing of the party locked down early. That freed them to spend months or even years wooing the conservative base. If you secure the moderate or establishment Republicans, you only need a relatively small slice of the true believers to get over the top (Barry Goldwater and Reagan had the opposite problem they had the true believers sewn up but had to work to persuade the moderates. The former failed, the latter succeeded.) During his vice presidency, George H. W. Bush cemented his lead by moving rightward on abortion and embracing Reaganism in totality. Dole, who’d let Bush get to his right in 1988, didn’t repeat that mistake in 1996. Throughout Bill Clinton’s first term, Dole courted the Right by attacking Hollywood and embracing the Christian Coalition. In the   to 2000, George W. Bush raised money from the establishment but courted Christian conservatives. The same pattern held true, more or less, for McCain and Romney. Jeb Bush, for his part, went into the 2016 campaign with the establishment largely in his pocket. The big donors, his family’s political machine, and veterans of his brother’s White House lined up. So far, so good. But Bush never really bothered to cultivate the Right. He even seemed to take it for granted. Once it became clear that the grass roots were not going to rally to Bush, he started to hemorrhage support from voters and donors who wanted to back a winner. But by then it was too late to unify the establishment around someone else. This was a particularly bad moment for such a mistake. Even moderate and liberal Republican voters have gone populist, which is why many are flocking to Trump. Acting a bit like Democrats, his supporters have fallen in love. It’s not clear they can be won back by conventional politicians. Meanwhile, Senator Ted Cruz has been methodical in his attention to the   grass roots. He’s not exactly the unifying   of the Right that Reagan and Goldwater were, but he at least figured out the political math  —   and the populist mood  —   early. That’s more than you can say for Jeb Bush. So now we have a    where there is supposed to be order  —   and we have relative order where there is supposed to be a   .,"

","China produces an astonishing number of astonishing numbers, including this: In the 20th century, America made automobiles   items, requiring prodigious road building. China, however, poured more concrete for roads and other construction between 2011 and 2013 than America did in the 20th century. This fact is emblematic of China’s remarkable success. And is related to its current difficulties, including its 2015 growth rate (6. 9 percent) its slowest in 25 years. The regime’s contract with its 1. 4 billion subjects is that it will deliver prosperity and they will be obedient. Now the bill is coming due for the measures taken to produce prosperity. No Westerner knows more about China’s regime and political economy than Henry Paulson who, as CEO of Goldman Sachs, U. S. treasury secretary, and subsequently has made more than 100 trips to China. In his book Dealing with China, he writes: China consumes almost half the world’s cement, coal, iron ore, and steel, and 40 percent of the aluminum and copper. Beijing has six ring roads and the seventh, under construction, will be almost 600 miles long, encompassing an area as large as Indiana. (Washington, D. C.’s beltway is 64 miles long.) Demand for roads so exceeds supply that a 2010 traffic jam extended 62 miles and lasted twelve days. China has six of the world’s 15 tallest buildings (America has three) and eight of the ten tallest under construction. In four years, beginning in 2011, the government built enough housing to shelter the population of the 12th most populous nation, the Philippines. Two months after the September 2014 $25 billion IPO for the Chinese internet company Alibaba, the world’s biggest IPO, the company had a $280 billion market capitalization, bigger than Amazon and eBay combined. Share article on FacebookshareTweet What the regime calls “socialism with Chinese characteristics” is, like sauerkraut ice cream, a combination of incompatible ingredients. A senior Chinese reformer propounded the “birdcage” theory of the “socialist market economy”: The market sector should be as free to fly as a bird in a cage  —   the cage of a   economy. Private enterprise, however, creates 90 percent of new jobs. By itself, the private sector, which accounts for perhaps 60 percent of China’s $10 trillion GDP, would be the world’s second biggest economy, trailing only America’s. RELATED: People Aren’t Widgets: Chinese Volatility and American Hubris, Although   enterprises (SOEs) are often corrupt and always inefficient, the regime resists privatizing SOEs, which would mean worker layoffs of up to 80 percent. More than 100, 000 local SOEs have been closed but, Paulson says, “perhaps another 100, 000 or more remain. ” The fact that Paulson says “no one seems to know the exact number” speaks volumes about the disorderly nature of things bubbling beneath China’s   authoritarianism. China’s 87 million party members, Paulson says, “work first and foremost for the party,” which remains “the alpha and omega of political, economic, and social life. ” But as Paulson says, “corruption breeds where power meets opportunity. ” Because opportunity festers everywhere that the party continues to insinuate itself, inefficient allocation of resources will depress growth.

S. opening to China, Daniel Patrick Moynihan acerbically said that many travelers to China returned more impressed by the absence of flies than by the absence of freedom. The continuing absence of the latter, illustrated by the apparent kidnapping of five Hong Kong booksellers, is not noticed by foreigners mesmerized by bullet trains.

","Donald Trump cannot quite decide what he thinks about the   visa program, under which certain   foreign workers are permitted to work in the United States. Silicon Valley executives love it, and Silicon Valley worker bees hate it, charging that it is used to undercut domestic wages. Because Donald Trump is a man who knows nothing about almost anything, his mind (as John B. Anderson once said of Jimmy Carter) is “like a seat cushion that bears the imprint of the last person who sat in it. ” In the last debate, Trump decided, out of nowhere, that he was reversing his formerly restrictive view of the   visa program, that our   businesses needed those foreign workers, the domestic supply being insufficient. About five minutes later, having been informed that abruptly reversing himself on his key issue was bound to cost him a few votes  —   one suspects that Ann Coulter was on the verge of tears or worse  —   Trump announced that he was reversing his reversal. RELATED: Donald Trump: The   Candidate, Donald Trump, a man whose sexual insecurities are such that he feels the need to reassure the republic that his tiny little fingers are not proportional to his genitals  —   Lincoln versus Douglas this ain’t  —   and to boast in his memoirs about his sex life (“Oftentimes when I was sleeping with one of the top women in the world I would say to myself, thinking about me as a boy from Queens, ‘Can you believe what I am getting? ’”) invested in beauty pageants and a modeling agency. If you are thinking that sounds like a pretty transparent ploy to put himself in the company of economically subordinate women, the fact is that his   wife is a former client of the Trump modeling agency, a Slovene by the name of Melanija Knavs, known to the world now as Melania Trump. The   Mrs. Trump came to these United States on an   visa. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Given Trump’s habitual disregard for the law and for basic decency in his business affairs, it will come as no surprise that there is evidence coming to light that Trump Model Management is a serial abuser of the   visa program, that it lied to modeling recruits overseas about their earnings in the United States while raiding such wages as they did earn with undisclosed fees (the structural parallels with   rings are too obvious to belabor) and, more to the point as a criminal question, lied to U. S. immigration authorities about those wages, too. The   program is structured in such as way as to (theoretically, if not in practice) prevent firms from simply bringing in foreign help on the cheap to avoid paying prevailing U. S. wages. The idea is that when companies that need specialized, highly skilled workers, or those with unusual endowments, they should be able to bring them in relatively easily from abroad when they cannot locate the workers they need at home. One of the safeguards is the requirement that firms disclose the wages of their foreign workers, so that these can be compared with typical domestic wages in the field. In the case of Alexia Palmer, a Jamaican model recruited by Trump and brought to the United States, the agency told her  —   and federal immigration authorities  —   that she would be paid $75, 000 a year, a figure that seems to have been the agency’s   figure. Given that the “prevailing wage” was calculated at $45, 000 a year, immigration authorities would not have any reason to believe that Palmer was simply being brought in to undercut domestic rivals financially. But, in reality, she was paid about $10, 000 a year on average. Under federal law, the requirement that   workers be paid what is claimed on their immigration paperwork falls either on an employer (in the case of a worker with a   commitment to one firm) or, as in the case of models such as Palmer, their agencies, in this case Trump Model Management. New York immigration lawyer Jeffrey Feinbloom tells CNN: “It seems pretty clear to me that there was a violation . . . and a pretty egregious violation. ” That would not be surprising: The program has a long and sometimes shocking history of abuse. More Donald Trump A Question Needing an AnswerIs Immigration to the U. S. an Entitlement? You gotta have heart, c. Trump likes to proclaim that our inability to enforce our immigration law is an existential threat, like terrorism: “Either we have a country or we don’t,” he says. When it comes to such threats, Trump’s   posturing encompasses all sorts of things: leaning on private companies and using the law to penalize them if they will not toe his line on immigration, violating the rights of U. S. citizens, and, famously, his pledging to treat the families of terrorism suspects like terrorists themselves, to be “very hard on the families. ” Trump has publicly stated that  —   his words here  —   “a young and beautiful piece of ass” is a shield against all criticism. But the   Mrs. Trump is literally the poster girl for a modeling agency that is credibly accused of systematically abusing the very immigration laws whose robust enforcement is the purported raison d’être of his presidential campaign. If immigration abuse is an existential threat and getting tough on the families is our new national ethos, there’s only one conclusion. Deport Melania Trump.,"

","Given their number and scale, it can be difficult to keep track of all of Donald Trump’s many scandals and debacles. And so, for those whose heads are still spinning, here is a comprehensive roundup of the man’s disastrous record: 1973: The Department of Justice’s   case against Trump’s   company, DOJ lawyers filed a case in 1973 accusing Trump Management, along with Trump and his father, Fred C. Trump, of violating the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Trump claimed he didn’t want the government to force him to rent to welfare recipients. Eventually he and his father reluctantly agreed to the judge’s order to place ads in local newspapers proclaiming their properties equally open to minorities. Trump Management also had to agree to end discriminatory practices, and he and his father had to “thoroughly acquaint themselves” with the Fair Housing Act. 1983 —  1985: New Jersey Generals, a failed U. S. Football League team, In a bid to attract attention, Trump lobbied to move USFL games to the fall to compete directly with the NFL (the USFL had played its season in the spring specifically to avoid the more established National Football League). The NFL commanded the TV networks, however, so with Trump’s lawyers, the league filed a $1. 69 billion antitrust and monopoly lawsuit against the NFL. The jury ruled that the NFL had a monopoly, but also that the USFL contributed to its downfall with overspending. The jury awarded the USFL $3  —   yes, three dollars  —   in damages, and the league folded. 1988 —  1992: Trump Airlines, Trump obtained a $380 million loan from 22 small banks in order to acquire a profitable division of the shaky Eastern Airlines. The division became Trump Airlines, officially named Trump Shuttle, Inc. and it never earned a profit. Trump defaulted on his loans in 1990. As owner, he invested in flashy technology and his signature luxury décor for the airplanes, while disregarding the real needs of his customers and falling victim to the high price of jet fuel during the first Iraq War. Trump Airlines ceased operation in April 1992. 1989 —  1990: Trump: The Game (board game) (revived in 2005) Milton Bradley joined Trump to release “Trump: The Game. ” Players’ goal is to make the best   deals. The game undersold in its first year, but Trump justified its rerelease 15 years later with the success of the   The Apprentice   show. 1990: Failure to pay contractors for Taj Mahal hotel and casino, While Trump spent $1 million every week on extravagant personal expenses, he cheated builders out of more than $60 million for work on his Atlantic City, N. J. property. The team of construction firms and suppliers that built the Taj Mahal hotel and casino struggled to overcome their losses, with some firms approaching bankruptcy: Marty Rosenberg, then —  vice president of Atlantic Plate Glass, said Trump owed his company about $1. 5 million in late payments for a glass job on the hotel. Rosenberg formed a committee of construction firms and suppliers defrauded by Trump. He then helped lead the committee’s efforts to procure from Trump what he owed them. Atlantic Plate Glass lost almost half a million dollars in the settlement, and Rosenberg suffered personal financial loss. Trump inveigled Rosenberg and the committee into accepting 20 cents on the dollar of their original agreement. The settlement allowed Trump to dodge an   lawsuit, but months later he filed for the first of his four bankruptcies. 1991: Trump Plaza’s violation of   laws in order to please Trump’s   pal, Robert LiButti, a famous horse breeder, was banned from New Jersey casinos after his connection to Mafia boss John Gotti was revealed. LiButti’s daughter Edith Creamer said her father and Trump had been comrades: gambling buddies, flying together in Trump’s helicopter, and partying on his yacht. New Jersey state regulators discovered their relationship while investigating allegations by nine Trump Plaza employees that the hotel had booted blacks and women from craps tables after LiButti complained about them. Trump Plaza was fined $200, 000 for violating state   laws. Trump claimed he barely knew LiButti, but Creamer maintained that she flew in Trump’s helicopter and partied on his yacht with him and her father.

Nevertheless, nine months later, with Trump nearly $4 billion in debt, he filed for bankruptcy for his Taj Mahal casino. Second bankruptcy: Trump was personally leveraged to almost $1 billion. Third bankruptcy: Trump Hotels  Casino Resorts filed for bankruptcy. Trump paid $72 million out of pocket.

He then married Maples, and divorced her seven years later, before marrying current wife Melania in 2005. Trump has also repeatedly bragged about sleeping with married women. 2005 —  2011: Trump University scam, Trump University was not a university  —   the New York State Education Department filed a lawsuit against it for operating without a NYSED license. (Its name was changed to the “Trump Entrepreneur Initiative. ”) Trump is now the defendant in two   lawsuits filed in California along with one filed in New York by Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who called the institution a “scam. ” A New York court has refused Trump’s lawyers’ request to throw the case out. Now one California plaintiff, yoga instructor Tarla Makaeff, wants to withdraw from the suit, citing stress and health problems, but Trump’s lawyers won’t have it. Makaeff claims she was scammed out of $60, 000. The New York lawsuit alone represents 5, 000 victims, and there are more. Prospective students were lured by a free seminar, which was really the first part of a    scheme that led to attendees’ being pressured into increasingly expensive seminars, starting with a   $1, 495 seminar and culminating with a $35, 000 “Gold Elite” program. RELATED: Yes, Trump University Was a Massive Scam, Trump University advertised Trump’s “handpicked” instructors, access to   lenders, and an improved credit score. These advertisements proved false. Richard Hewson says he paid over $20, 000 “for nothing. ” In a series of   ads by super PAC American Future Fund, Bob said the institution didn’t honor its promise to give him a list of   lenders Kevin said Trump U “ruined” his credit score  —   in fact, students were told to lie to   companies and Sherri said the Trump U was not supervised or run by Donald Trump, but was “just a fake. ” And not a single instructor was “handpicked” by Trump many came from non —  real estate backgrounds, and some were downright shady  —   including motivational speakers and a felon. The “school” didn’t even craft a curriculum. 2006: Trump sued a journalist for libel and lost, badly, Years before Trump vowed on the campaign trail to “open up libel” laws in order make it easier for him to sue news outlets, he tried invoking the reigning libel laws to sue a journalist for questioning his net worth. He went to court with Timothy L. O’Brien, then a business reporter at the New York Times. In 2005, O’Brien used estimates from people knowledgeable about Trump’s finances to argue Trump was worth between $150 million and $250 million  —   much less than the $6 billion Trump purported to be worth at the time. RELATED: The Litigious  —   and Bullying  —   Mr. Trump, Trump sued O’Brien, claiming harm to his business and seeking $5 billion in damages. Trump spent more than $1 million in legal fees over the course of five years. He conceded, under questioning from O’Brien’s attorneys during a deposition, that he had consulted his own feelings to determine his net worth. Needless to say, he lost the suit.  2006 —  2007: GoTrump. com, GoTrump was a   search engine for customers seeking   deals, such as discounts on private jets. It supposedly featured Trump’s personal recommendations and travel tips, but  —   recalling the “handpicked” faculty at Trump U  —   one doubts their authenticity. Called a “vanity site” by one financial analyst, it shut down a year later. 2006 —  2007: Trump Mortgage, The man Trump hired to head his mortgage company called himself a top Wall Street executive, when in fact he had lackluster banking credentials. The company folded in a year. But don’t worry  —   when running the country, Trump will hire “the best people. ” 2006 —  2011: Trump Vodka, Trump “super premium” vodka was launched under the   slogan “Success Distilled. ” The vodka ended production when the company didn’t meet threshold sales requirements. 2006 —  2015: American Communications Network boondoggle, For nine years, Trump appeared in promotional videos hawking ACN’s “revolutionary products” such as the company’s videophone. But the business model of ACN, a telecommunications company based on   marketing, was almost indistinguishable from a pyramid scheme. ACN sales agents received a commission for selling a product to a new customer, and then recruited that customer to become a new sales agent, earning commissions from their sales down the line. RELATED: Trump’s   Marketing Telecom Endorsement Is Another Example of His Terrible Judgement, Regulators in Canada and Australia flagged the company, but courts there concluded that ACN was not operating a pyramid scheme. In the United States, however, ACN was ordered to cease and desist on the grounds that it appeared to be running a pyramid scheme by Montana regulators (the fault was eventually determined to rest with individual ACN representatives and not with the company’s business model, though the company did agree to provide additional training to its representatives).

Alas, when Trump paraded “his” steaks at a    press conference on March 8, the meat had been purchased directly from Bush Brothers Provisions and dubbed “Trump Steaks. ” In fact, the steaks sold at Trump’s properties and clubs arrived still wrapped in Bush Brothers packaging. These were not the Trump Steaks that had been sold by the Sharper Image beginning in 2007  —   steaks that sold very poorly before being discontinued this business venture was not, shall we say, well done. 2007 —  2009: Trump magazine, This glossy quarterly of Trump   folded in 2009  —   the magazine Trump recently hurled into a   audience was not, as he asserted, a Trump magazine, and you won’t find it at newsstands. Unsurprisingly, Trump magazine featured Trump or a Trump family member on almost every cover. 2009 —  2011: Trump Network, The Trump Network was another failed    venture that was arguably a pyramid scheme. It sold customized vitamins based on urine samples collected by its “scientific” testing kits. Not only is this junk science, but the network worked on a bogus marketing strategy in which buyers become sellers and earn commission on their recruits’ sales, as with ACN. After financial troubles the company was sold in 2012  —   and recruiters shouldered the losses.

A   video was produced to entice Chinese investors to finance Trump Bay Street, a   tower in New Jersey.

","In the nearly seven years since the 2009 subway crash that killed nine people, the Washington, D. C. Metro transit system has spent more than $4. 5 billion on a   project designed to increase safety. The Metro system’s proposed   Capital Improvement Program envisions $6 to $8 billion in additional funding. But despite the expenditures so far, last week it was announced that safety had deteriorated so much that large parts of the system might have to be shut down for up to six months to make repairs. And, while many Americans might be thrilled at the prospect of Congress and federal bureaucrats unable to get to work, we might also be wondering where those billions went. When there is a   this big  —   you may quite naturally be thinking  —   people are held responsible. Heads must have rolled. Okay, but even if the people responsible weren’t punished, at least the system won’t see another dime of taxpayer money until it gets its act together, right? Don’t count on it. Metro is seeking as much as $1 billion per year for capital investments and repairs that should have been made with the first $4. 5 billion. Whoever said “Failure is its own reward” probably didn’t have this in mind. Does anyone think that failures of this magnitude would be tolerated in the private sector? Well, maybe they would in an environment of government bailouts and cronyism, but not in a free market. Markets reward success, and they also punish failure. Government? Not so much. And the problem is not just   failures or scandals. Our schools do a worse and worse job of educating our children, even as we steadily increase education spending. More than $22 trillion in   spending has failed to reduce poverty, and so Washington seeks yet more money to continue the fight. Social Security and Medicare are going broke at their current levels of spending, while Democrats call for expanding the programs. And if we are hoping for this trend to change, we shouldn’t be looking to either the Democratic or the Republican   for the presidential nomination. Clinton? Accountability? One can’t use those two words in the same sentence without breaking down in paroxysms of laughter. From Whitewater to Benghazi, Hillary Clinton’s life has been an exercise in avoiding responsibility. Perhaps worse, she is a wholly owned subsidiary of the public employees’ unions. What about Donald Trump? One might think that a Washington outsider and a businessman would bring a new measure of accountability to the federal government. But his refusal even to reprimand his campaign manager for grabbing a reporter is just the latest example of a lack of accountability in the Trump campaign. Trump has made a fetish out of never admitting to a mistake. Nor does he hold his employees responsible for their actions. And, no, firing someone on The Apprentice doesn’t count. Ultimately, though, the answer is not about changing the names of those in charge. Yes, better management can help. But a lack of accountability is built into the DNA of big government. Government bureaucracies, programs, and, indeed, much of government itself exist for their own sake  —   they work for their own benefit, not to serve their constituents. That makes the cycle of failure, excuse, and demand for more money inevitable.  We should keep that in mind the next time a politician promises to get rid of waste, fraud, and abuse  —   i. e. to make government more efficient. He might as well promise to make pigs fly."

","‘Gestapo tactics. ” That’s how Donald Trump’s recently installed campaign manager, Paul Manafort, characterized the Ted Cruz campaign’s successful effort to win all 34 of Colorado’s pledged   delegates at the   Republican   and state conventions. “Today winning votes doesn’t mean anything,” Trump complained. “It’s a corrupt deal going on in this country and it’s not fair to you people. ” That happened because of the rules. Trump has benefited from    rules in states such as Florida and Arizona. He has benefited from split opposition: In only one state (Massachusetts) has he won more popular votes than the combined total for Cruz, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich. RELATED: Trump Has No One But Himself to Blame for a Weak Ground Game, But he did have complaints when Cruz operatives worked successfully to win technically uncommitted delegates in conventions, as they did in Louisiana and North Dakota. Trump’s response: “I don’t care about rules. ” It seems to run in the family. Trump’s son Eric and daughter Ivanka can’t vote for him in the New York primary because, as Trump explained, “They didn’t know the rules and they didn’t register [Republican] in time. ” Even though the rules have been in force for years and are readily accessible online. RELATED: Can Professional Hired Guns Stop the Trump Campaign from Further Stumbling? The Colorado rules Trump complains about were adopted last August and were made available online in September. The Cruz campaign took note and started working to use them to maximum advantage. The Trump campaign didn’t. Whose fault is that? Plus, it is odd to hear charges of “Gestapo tactics” from a spokesman for a candidate who has encouraged supporters to beat up hecklers and offered to pay for their legal expenses. Nonetheless, it’s inevitable that some Trump supporters will find merit in his plaints and if, as seems likely but not certain, he fails to win in primaries and caucuses the 1, 237 delegate votes needed for the nomination, they will start bellowing, “We wuz robbed. ” EDITORIAL: Read the Rules, Mr. Trump, Trump himself has suggested that the 1, 237 is just an arbitrary number and has encouraged voters to believe, as polls show most   voters do, that the candidate with the most delegates is entitled to the nomination even if he falls short of the majority. But requiring a majority is the opposite of arbitrary. The requirement is designed to prevent a party from being saddled with a nominee opposed by a majority of delegates.

None of the successive reforms made since 1968 have produced a perfect system and, in a nation of this size, none can. A national primary would penalize all but a few nationally known candidates.

78597,119216,The House Stands Up to Unconstitutional Obamacare Payments,National Review,Josh Blackman,2016-05-13,2016.0,5.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/435371/executive-action-courts-house-challenges-obamacare-power-grab
","Time and again, the Obama administration has modified, delayed, and suspended the law through unprecedented executive actions. The government’s most frequent defense is denial: Because no one is injured by their actions, no one has “standing” to challenge the actions in federal court. However, once forced to defend its policies, the government finds that its specious arguments quickly crumble. In a historic decision yesterday, a federal court held that unappropriated funds paid under Obamacare were unconstitutional and that the House of Representatives could challenge them in court. This decision should resonate widely, as other courts continue to shine a light on illegal presidential power. Recognizing that Congress did not provide funding for Section 1402, the Obama administration requested $1. 4 billion for fiscal year 2014. Congress denied that request. Instead of dealing with reality, the government instead pretended that the ACA actually funded Section 1402 all along  —   it didn’t need to even ask for money in the first place! Therefore, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) continued to pay billions of dollars to insurance companies that suffered losses under Obamacare. In September 2015, the court found that the House was injured and had standing to sue. Judge Collyer wrote that the “constitutional trespass alleged in this case would inflict a concrete, particular harm upon the House for which it has standing to seek redress in this Court. ” RELATED: An   Victory for the House  —   and the Constitution, From there, it was downhill for the government. No longer able to hide behind the “standing” shield, the Justice Department had to confront the legality of the payments. Article I of the Constitution provides that “no Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law. ” No appropriation, no money. In Federalist No. 58, James Madison wrote that “this power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon” of Congress to check the executive. These appropriations, Judge Collyer wrote, are an “integral part of our constitutional checks and balances, insofar as they tie the Executive Branch to the Legislative Branch via purse strings. ” Share article on FacebookshareTweet The court systematically rejected each of the executive branch’s arguments. First, Judge Collyer scoffed at the government’s ludicrous argument that the appropriation for Section 1401 also provides an appropriation for Section 1402. “It is a most curious and convoluted argument,” she wrote, “whose mother was undoubtedly necessity. ” In other words, the creative lawyers at the Justice Department made a textualist argument because they had to say something in court. But in fact, Congress permanently appropriated funding for Section 1401, to cover the subsidies for insurance premiums, but did not appropriate any funds to reimburse insurance companies under Section 1402. It really is that simple. RELATED: The Increasing Instability of Obamacare, Second, the government argued that the appropriation from Section 1401 can be understood to also cover Section 1402, because the two policies are “economically and programmatically integrated. ” The court recognized that “an appropriation must be expressly stated it cannot be inferred or implied. ” Congress does not “squeeze the elephant of Section 1402 reimbursements into the mousehole of Section 1401. ” Billions of dollars in spending are not left to implication. Even if we assume that the two policies are connected, this argument does not work. Third, HHS warned that blocking payments to insurance companies would “yield absurd economic, fiscal, and   results. ” Judge Collyer dispatched this argument, finding that the “results predicted by the [government] flow not from the ACA, but from Congress’ subsequent refusal to appropriate money. ” If Congress does not want the government to pay insurance companies for losses suffered because of Obamacare, the court concluded, “that is Congress’s prerogative the Court cannot override it by rewriting” the ACA. In short, paying the Section 1402 subsidies based on the 1401 appropriation “violates the Constitution. Congress is the only source for such an appropriation, and no public money can be spent without one. ” RELATED: Obamacare’s   Failure, Conservatives have long advocated for a rigorous standing doctrine as a means to prevent “activist” courts from interfering with the democratic process. Indeed, Justice Antonin Scalia viewed standing as “a crucial and inseparable element of the separation of powers. ” He wrote that making it harder for plaintiffs to bring constitutional challenges in federal court would reduce the “overjudicialization of the processes of  . ” The late justice’s approach is sound in theory, but risky in fact. In recent years, rather than protecting the separation of powers, the standing doctrine has served to insulate ambitious presidents as they run amok across what James Madison referred to as “parchment barriers. ” Judge Collyer’s decision to grant the House of Representatives standing has exposed an illegal expenditure of billions of dollars without even the pretense of an appropriation. Relatedly, the Fifth Circuit’s decision to grant the state of Texas standing to challenge President Obama’s immigration actions has shined a light on an unprecedented act of executive lawmaking. Cramped standing doctrines would allow these abuses of presidential power to continue without any scrutiny. Government lawyers can simply walk into court and shake their heads no. When the president is willing to spend money without Congress’s permission, or to rewrite laws when Congress refuses to, the traditional political process has collapsed. The courts must force the executive branch to explain its actions and abide within its broad  —   but constrained  —   sphere of power. More Obamacare ‘Repeal and Replace’? Try ‘Tweak and Move On’No, Obamacare Repeal Will Not Kill Tens of ThousandsThe shocking speed of entrenchment, c. Later in his tenure, Justice Scalia may have started to reconsider his   views on standing doctrine as it relates to the separation of powers. In National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning, the Court unanimously invalidated President Obama’s illegal recess appointments. Justice Scalia concurred in judgment, but his opinion read more like a dissent. He lamented that the Court squandered a rare opportunity where parties had standing to raise a    challenge. “It is not every day that we encounter a proper case or controversy requiring interpretation of the Constitution’s structural provisions,” Scalia wrote. He urged the Court to “take every opportunity to affirm the primacy of the Constitution’s enduring principles over the politics of the moment. ” Judges should think twice about looking askance at abuses of the rule of law before sticking their head in the sands of standing doctrine.,"

","Democracy is too important to be left to the people. That is the global elite’s collective reaction to Britain’s vote to exit the European Union, which is being portrayed as the work of   xenophobes who never should have been entrusted with a decision of such   importance. The opiate of the Western political class is cosmopolitanism, making it almost impossible for elites to understand the Brexit vote on its own terms. Britain gave us Magna Carta and such foundational thinkers on the road to democratic rule as John Locke, Algernon Sidney, and John Milton. It resisted centralizing monarchs in the turbulence of the 17th century, and defeated continental threats to its sovereignty emanating from Spain (King Philip II) France (Napoleon) and Germany (Hitler). Should it be shocking that it said “no thanks” to continuing to subsume itself in a budding European superstate? Maintaining British sovereignty, broadly construed, was the overwhelming rationale for Brexit. According to a survey by Lord Ashcroft Polls, 49 percent of leave voters said the biggest reason for exiting the EU was “that decisions about the U. K. should be taken in the U. K. ” Another 33 percent said it was the best way to regain power over the U. K.’s borders, and 13 percent said they worried the U. K. couldn’t control how the EU “expanded its membership or its powers. ” All the critics of Brexit see in the vote, though, is hostility to immigrants. There is no doubt that immigration played a large role. But a country controlling its own borders is a necessary element of sovereignty. The   population of Britain has doubled in the past 20 years, with the government powerless to stop much of the influx. It,   should be the right of the British people to decide whether they want less or more immigration. A constant refrain of Brexit critics is that leaving the EU was much too complex and important an issue to put to a referendum. But at bottom the question was simple: Shall parliament remain the supreme lawmaking body in Britain or not? This is a foundational decision that it makes sense to put directly before the voters. RELATED: U. K. Leaders Must Let the Brexit Vote Stand, Princeton historian David Bell is a critic of government by referenda, but has noted how referenda are appropriate when fundamental constitutional questions are at stake: “They represent instances when sovereign power, always ultimately held by the people, but mediated by constitutional structures, temporarily reverts to the people directly, so that they can modify or replace these structures. ” The British people voted to reject the EU superstructure that had been hoisted on top of their traditional political institutions. The vote roiled the markets, and another theme of Brexit critics is that leave voters now regret their temper tantrum. But a poll for the Sunday Mirror newspaper found that 92 percent of leave voters were happy with the outcome of the referendum.

But my wife and I do, and we’ve attempted to mark the occasion nevertheless  —   in loco filius, if you will. As such, Jack will be dressed today in a special onesie (stylized picture of a milk bottle, “Come and Take It” tagline) he will wear his Old Glory sun hat and he will be involved in all the festivities that the family has to offer. Naturally, none of this will make even the slightest bit of sense to him as a matter of fact, today will be the same as is any other day in the life of a baby, just with more people around and a surfeit of BBQ. But you have to start somewhere, right? Once they reach a certain age, we expect our children to know what is what. As soon as they start speaking, we begin to teach them right and wrong once they are old enough to be trusted with responsibility, we monitor closely how it is being used and, in a process that is hopefully   we make sure that they know as much about the world around them as they are capable of taking in. It is in pursuit of this lattermost goal that we designate national holidays. In May, we celebrate Memorial Day, lest we forget what we owe our ancestors. In January, we observe Martin Luther King Day, that we might bring to mind the most uncomfortable parts of our nation’s past. And on July Fourth we arrange an ostentatious display of patriotism, in resounding commemoration of the moment that a ragtag bunch of   rebels set their revolutionary ideals before a candid world, and changed human history forever. Share article on FacebookshareTweet In certain quarters it is fashionable to disdain these occasions, and, in so doing, to treat the past as if it were wholly disconnected from the present. Indeed, staunch defenders of the American Founding are often told that to embrace modernity it is necessarily to jettison the antique. “Why,” it is asked, “do we celebrate these flawed men and their pieces of parchment? After all, John Adams couldn’t even have imagined Tinder. ” Though narrow, this critique is indisputably correct. John Adams could not have imagined Tinder, and I daresay that he had no conception of   trading, of synthetic fibers, or of advanced robots either. But, ultimately, that is irrelevant. The beauty of the American Founding was not that it provided a detailed roadmap that could predict the minutiae of the future in glorious perpetuity, but that it laid out for all people a set of timeless and universal ideals, the veracity and applicability of which are contingent upon neither the transient mood of the mob nor the present state of technology. Among those ideals are that “all men are created equal,” and that they “are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights” that “Governments are instituted among Men” in order to “secure” their “rights” that legitimate power derives “from the consent of the governed” and that if any such government is seized or corrupted by tyrants, “it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it. ” At times, the United States has failed disastrously to live up to these principles, and, on at least one occasion, significant forces within the union have rejected them outright. But that an ideal has been violated in no way undermines its value, and it seems patently obvious to me that the country has been blessed by having had an eloquent North star to which its downtrodden could point from their moments of need. If July Fourth is to represent anything concrete, it should serve as a golden opportunity to ensure that that star does not wither or implode or disappear from public view. In Britain  —   a less propositional nation in which the constitution is uncodified, in which there are no indisputably “foundational” documents, and in which there are no widely celebrated national days of meaning  —   it can be difficult to convey the importance of core national values, whatever those may be. Americans, by contrast, have fallen heir to an embarrassment of riches. If I cannot explain to my son how lucky he is to have been born here  —   and if I cannot demonstrate what a heavy responsibility it is to keep the candle burning  —   I do not deserve to be called “Dad. ” More Independence Day What Are We Celebrating? Notes from D. C. Britain’s Declaration of IndependenceIn a 1788 letter to Thomas Jefferson, James Madison outlined the didactic justification for the construction of the Bill of Rights. “Political truths declared in that solemn manner,” Madison proposed, tend to “acquire by degrees the character of fundamental maxims of free Government, and as they become incorporated with the national sentiment, counteract the impulses of interest and passion. ” Such benefits are not limited to the Bill of Rights. Just as Americans will proudly cite the first ten Amendments in the course of defending the ordered liberty that is the birthright of all free men, so they are prone to cite the most explosive literature of the revolutionary era. If internalized and cherished, Abraham Lincoln argued, the Declaration of Independence would have the salutary effect of acting as “a rebuke and a   to the very harbingers of   tyranny and oppression,” for Jefferson’s work was not “a merely revolutionary document” but the embalming of “an abstract truth, applicable to all men and all times. ” Yes, even to   .

","Trump is up. No, Hillary is up. Is Gary Johnson surging? Hey, is that Jill Stein? Political junkies are obsessed with polls, and almost every day brings a new one to feed our fix. The latest numbers suggest that Trump’s convention bounce has dissipated, and Hillary is enjoying hers. Most polls released this week put her up by 5 to 9 points. Crucially, though, her favorability ratings and voters’ opinion of her truthfulness and trustworthiness have not improved significantly, suggesting that her overall numbers will fade again soon. Tune out until  . The closer we get to the election, the more accurate polls are likely to be. Right now, the vast majority of Americans are paying little or no attention to politics. Consider that 34. 9 million Americans watched Donald Trump’s acceptance speech, and 33. 3 million watched Hillary’s. There was undoubtedly a huge overlap. But even if there was no overlap, that means half of those who will vote this November did not watch either one. And we are about to head into the Olympics, which will dominate the news and drown out the candidates’ messages for the next three weeks. Positions may be more hardened this year, because both candidates are so well known and so polarizing. Their partisans are unlikely to change their minds. But for the rest of the electorate, there’s a lot yet to come: the debates,   advertising, world events. Who knows what Trump might say next, or whether there’s another scandal awaiting Hillary? Is it a   or a   (or  ) way race? Some polls offer Trump and Clinton as the only options, forcing the binary choice. But when voters actually enter the voting booth, they will have other choices. Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson will be on the ballot in all 50 states, and the Green Party’s Jill Stein is already on the ballot in 23 states and D. C. and has filed in 8 more. Polls since the convention have generally shown Johnson taking 8 to 12 percent of the vote in a   race. Traditionally,   candidates have faded as the election gets closer, but, as we have seen, this is far from a traditional year, and those numbers have held remarkably firm so far. Given that Johnson is still largely unknown, a great deal of his support may just be a proxy for none of the above. As such, he seems to be taking support about equally from both Trump and Clinton. But what happens if he picks up a couple of points and gets into the debates, or attracts enough funding to make a significant advertising effort? Would that change the campaign dynamics? Keep an eye out. National vs. state polls: While most polls are based on national samples, we don’t elect a president through a national vote, but through 50 state contests. If Hillary is running up her numbers in California, or Trump is winning big in Texas, that can distort the results. One can overstate this, of course, since 2000 was the first election since 1888 in which the winner of the electoral vote lost the popular vote. Still, there are bellwether states that can tell us a great deal about the election outcome. How is Trump performing in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio? Is Clinton outperforming in states like Arizona and North Carolina? Who has the advantage in Florida? And it is in    races that   candidates can make a big difference. Could Johnson, or Stein for that matter, tip a state one way or the other? Remember, it was likely a combination of Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan that gave Florida to Bush in 2000. Is it possible that a candidate like Johnson could even win a state in the libertarian West? Don’t   your favorite poll. Confirmation bias is never stronger than when we look at polls. We can always find a poll that looks good for the candidate we support. And we all know that certain polls skew Republican, while others skew Democratic (usually by 2 or 3 points). There will undoubtedly be outliers leading to excited headlines about a “shock poll. ” And, yes, the pollsters have certainly gotten it wrong more than once in recent years. Still, if you look at the aggregate, such as the RealClearPolitics average, you can get a pretty good idea of where the race is headed. Watch the internals. The Trump campaign is based on a gamble. He expects to lose overwhelmingly with women and minorities. Some recent polls show him receiving as little as 1 percent of the   vote, and less than 20 percent of the Latino vote. He is also losing   whites, a group that Republicans have carried since modern polling began in 1952. He hopes that he can offset those losses by driving up both the turnout and his margin among      whites. Mitt Romney won 61 percent of those voters in 2012. Trump will have to do quite a bit better than that. Like a car accident along the highway, the latest poll always grabs our attention. And Republicans should have learned from 2012 that you ignore them at your peril. But before we get too excited by the next tick up or down, everyone should take a deep breath and keep it all in perspective.,"
80924,122046,Trump’s Christmas Gift to America,National Review,Heather Wilhelm,2016-12-14,2016.0,12.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/443013/donald-trump-makes-liberals-fear-big-government
","On Tuesday morning, the Heritage Foundation, the   conservative think tank, composed a doozy of a tweet, queued it up, and cheerfully blasted it out to over half a million followers. “It’s beginning to look at lot like Christmas,” Heritage declared, attaching a graphic of a beaming,     Donald Trump. One of Trump’s favorite rally    —   beloved by some, gleefully mocked by others —   was helpfully superimposed on the image: “We’re going to start saying Merry Christmas again. ” Like many Americans who never stopped saying Merry Christmas in the first place  —   full disclosure: I sometimes also say “Happy Holidays,” “Happy Hanukkah,” or other jolly derivations on this theme  —   I found this somewhat confusing. Is the resurgence of “Merry Christmas,” said in concert from sea to shining sea, really a gift that   Donald Trump will bestow upon America? Lo and behold! Merry Christmas! Witness Ana Marie Cox, a popular progressive writer with gigs at MTV and the New York Times. “So who else has been researching basic disaster prep stuff?” she polled her Twitter audience on Wednesday. “Bc —  congrats, right wingers —  I do not trust the government to help anymore!” Her next tweet extended the holiday merriment to our nation’s Second Amendment enthusiasts: “Getting my rifle out of storage this week. ” All kidding aside, though, the era of   panic is here, it’s real, and it’s growing like a   bureaucracy with an unlimited budget staffed by hundreds of enthusiastic Millennials paralyzed by college debt. The difference between people like me and many suddenly panicked progressives, of course, is that I’ve never really trusted big, expansive,    government, no matter who the president might be. This isn’t a stance based on paranoia of the kind that makes you put tinfoil hats on all 17 of your cats. It’s a rational conclusion based on familiarity with sound economics, historical evidence, and comparative politics. We   types will have to take what we can get, though. Witness Vox, the website modestly dedicated to explaining everything in the world. Vox, you see, is suddenly on board with federalism and “states’ rights,” a term one of its writers derided in February as “the sneaky language today’s politicians use to get away with racism and sexism. ” What a difference ten months and a new president make! On Tuesday, our    had a much different explanation: “We’re about to see states’ rights used defensively against Trump. ” Or take the newfound media panic about a change to the nation’s Broadcasting Board of Directors, which supervises the Voice of America and other   media outlets. Power over the board is about to be consolidated in the hands of a presidential appointee, in an ostensible reform that “Vladimir Putin or Qatar’s emir might admire,” as the earnest Washington Post editorial board worried on December 9. How on earth did we sink to this dangerous state of affairs? “The Obama administration  —   perhaps anticipating a Hillary Clinton Presidency  —   supported these changes. ” More Trump Administration The Progressive BoomerangA Great Week for the Trump Administration’s Environmental and Energy PoliciesOn Immigration, GOP State Attorneys General Echo TrumpExpect to see confusion mixed in with the consternation. There will be massive   for instance, about Trump’s meeting with various celebrities, conveniently ignoring the fact that President Obama once granted an interview to a YouTube star who sits in a bathtub filled with Froot Loops. There will be earnest articles about how Trump is a secret “Ayn Rand acolyte”  —   the Washington Post ran one this week  —   that oddly omit his repeated, decidedly   calls for haphazard government intervention in the domestic economy. And over the next few days, there will be earnest attempts  —   after a month of berating the horrors of the Electoral College  —   to talk various electors into going rogue. Yes, moving on into the Trump presidency, we can expect to see more of this strange new liberal respect for limited government, federalism, and a restrained executive. And when the seesaw of political power eventually tilts back to the left? I’d guess progressives will forget this ever happened, cheer right up, and revert to   business as usual. Some things, after all, never change.,"

","The ink had not dried on Scott Pruitt’s nomination to head the EPA before many in the media labeled him a “climate denier. ” Like most cases of slander, this one rested on the flimsiest of reeds  —   lines from an   I   with Attorney General Pruitt and published in May at National Review Online under the title “The   Gang. ” The column is still available for all to read and should speak for itself, but some attacks should not go unrebutted. So let’s set the record straight. Our column wasn’t about climate change itself or even public policies that purport to address it. It was about an effort by some irresponsible state attorneys general to prosecute as fraud public disagreement about climate change. This effort to turn the prosecutorial powers of the state against political opponents is   and should be opposed at every turn. Scott Pruitt had the courage to stand up for our First Amendment rights, and for that, he has now become a target of groups who will press their radical   agenda at any cost. Climate change is not an excuse to silence political speech. Climate change is not an excuse for the EPA to ignore the bounds of law and issue illegal regulations that will cost jobs, shutter industries, and have little to no positive impact on the environment. Climate change is not an excuse for imposing     regulations on the states, or for ignoring the unique concerns of citizens, businesses, and political leaders. Climate change is not an excuse to give the federal government ever more power over private property and state resources. I have joined with Scott Pruitt and other attorneys general  —   Republicans and Democrats  —   to oppose the EPA when it oversteps its bounds. But suing the federal government isn’t easy or enjoyable, and it’s certainly not the best way to fix an agency that has gone far astray. The best way to do that is to put someone in office who understands the law, who cares about the mission of the agency, and who will use its vast power with restraint and in keeping with the laws that govern it. More Trump Administration The Progressive BoomerangA Great Week for the Trump Administration’s Environmental and Energy PoliciesOn Immigration, GOP State Attorneys General Echo TrumpScott Pruitt will restore the EPA to its intended purpose. He will work with the states, not against them, to craft solutions that address the unique concerns of those states. What works in California may not work in Alaska, or Texas, or Alabama, or Maine. And by grounding new environmental policies in the rule of law, Pruitt will ensure that their impact lasts longer than a press release. I have little doubt that the attacks on Pruitt will only intensify as he nears confirmation. I also have little doubt that he will continue to stand firm in the face of them. I only hope that leaders in the Senate will demonstrate that same fortitude.,"

","Some 1. 2 million drones were wrapped up under American Christmas trees last month, according to the Consumer Technology Association. But good luck finding a spot to fly that gift in NYC  —   which has banned drones most everywhere, including all of Manhattan. If you didn’t know this, you’ve just been saved a potentially hefty fine. (You’re welcome.) Thankfully, there are a few parks in the other boroughs that allow model aircrafts, granting even the most casual drone hobbyist the opportunity to capture breathtaking views of the city and its surroundings. Before lifting off, be sure to   and download the   which is sponsored by the Federal Aviation Administration and displays   zones and safe flying areas, as well as a list of rules and regulations that   operators need to keep in mind while flying. Once you’re ready to pilot, here are the five most scenic, sprawling  —   and legal  —   fly zones in NYC. Just south of Citi Field, Flushing   Park boasts multiple soccer fields, a baseball field, basketball courts and, of course, a model aircraft field. This   park sits on just under 900 acres, and in the morning, you might catch crews rowing on the river. Flushing Meadows’ designated flying field is wedged between Meadow Lake and Van Wyck Expressway, meaning you’ve got tons of glorious cinematic scenes at your fingertips. Nina Katcheva Tushevs,   of the drone photography group Tushev Aerials, also recommends hovering above the New York Hall of Science for cool shots of some of the rockets that helped kick off the space race. Alas, because of the fly zone’s limits, you won’t be able to get any shots of the iconic NY Pavilion and Unisphere. Calvert Vaux Park’s model aircraft field, maintained by the Seaview Rotary Wings RC Helicopter Club, is the perfect setting for rookie fliers to embark on their maiden voyage, due to its secluded,   landscape  . Take flight from this park and you’ll capture stunning images of neighboring Coney Island Creek Park and the   Bridge. You may even catch a passing cruise ship, if you’re lucky. Like Calvert Vaux, Marine Park is located on the water in Brooklyn (which automatically makes for some killer aerial shots) and you must   to fly here. The   area in this park dwells in the Radio Control Society’s field just behind the Seba Playground and skate park. Fly above the wooded area and you’ll discover Shell Bank Creek flowing between Marine Park and Plumb Island. Known for its luscious green golf course and winding, scenic paths, Forest Park  —   straddling Brooklyn and Queens  —   has a secluded model aircraft field on the western end of the park at Jackie Robinson Parkway and Forest Parkway. Fly out of the narrow, circular field and soar over   Mt. Hope Cemetery. If skies are clear enough, you’ll catch a faint glimpse of Manhattan’s skyline. Throttle your aircraft east above the golf course and you’ll feel like a PGA championship broadcaster. LaTourette makes up nearly   of Staten Island’s enormous   Greenbelt. If you’re a fan of the green, LaTourette is set up to please your inner Tiger Woods  —   from above. Take off from the designated airfield tucked behind the golf course, or buzz over Richmond Creek to look for wildlife."

","A shrinking number of Americans believe they’ll die with debt —  thanks to   Donald Trump. The election of Trump, who has as much as $1. 5 billion in debt through his companies and has declared bankruptcy four times, was one of the biggest drivers for the decline  —   but was largely drawn along party lines.  The number of Republicans who thought they’d die   fell to 12 percent, from 24 percent in late 2015. Political independents had a similar drop, to 11 percent, from 21 percent.  Democrats were the least enthusiastic about the upcoming Trump years  —   dropping 4 percentage points  —   but only 10 percent are now worried about owing money on their deathbed.  The confidence is, in part, because more Americans believe they’ll be able to get a job to help pay off their debts, said Matt Schulz, analyst at CreditCards. com. “Confidence is great as long as it doesn’t turn into overconfidence,” Schulz told The Post. “It’s really important that, regardless of how confident they feel, people are still cautious and still careful with their money. ” The study also said that almost one in four people is completely    —   up from 14 percent in December 2014.  “There’s definitely a group of Americans of all ages who, in the wake of the Great Recession, decided to swear off credit and to play it a little more cautiously,” Schulz said."

","A jailed former English teacher admitted last week that losing sight of her “values” led her to having sex with three of her students  —   one of whom was a    boy she defiled in a church parking lot.

Altice, 37, a former teacher at David High School in Kaysville, UT, was sentenced in 2015 to two to 30 years in prison on three felony counts of forcible sex abuse. The board  ordered her to  attend a sex offender treatment program before her next hearing in April 2019. The disgraced teacher told officials last week that her low   drove her to seek out the company of her students in 2015. “I clearly lost sight of all my values and my principles and was seeking inappropriate means to address my own issues,” Altice said during the Jan. 24 parole hearing. “Issues I’m very aware of now,”    Besides the    Altice also had sex with a    at his home, and another    who she met while out on bail and facing criminal charges for the other two, according to Board of Pardons and Parole   Robert Yeates."

I have talked to some other people. I am talking about other things. I have some plans. Well, I always have plans, but my FAN career is ending on December 15. I totally promise. ” When Russo pressed him for more information, Francesa offered an intriguing refrain: He will be heard, but his new role may stray from the “conventional. ” “You will hear my voice. How’s that?” he said. “I’m not promising it’ll be conventional. It might be a little something new. ” Francesa said he’s been talking to “about six or eight” different people about opportunities   and that, come January, people can expect his voice around, somewhere. “I’ll be on in January,” he confirmed. “No, it will not be FAN.

","On Thursday, while meeting with the chief executives of many of the country’s major airlines, the CEO of America dropped a hint about the timing of his much anticipated tax plan. Taxes are something that both everyday Americans and corporate America alike are anxious about. That’s understandable, because they were the core of President Trump’s platform and, I would argue, an underemphasized key to his victory in November. In the meeting, the president said, “We’re going to lower the overall tax burden on American business big league,” and “We’re going to be announcing something I would say over the next two or three weeks that will be phenomenal in terms of tax. ” He’s clearly aware of the nation’s angst. So what’s been the holdup? What else? The progressives for no progress. The   left minority in the Senate   a clearly qualified   for weeks. A vote is tentatively slated for Monday. It is the secretary of the Treasury who implements and helps craft tax and economic policy for the country and its taxpayers, and it is the secretary of the Treasury who oversees financial and monetary matters for the country domestically and abroad. Think taxes, bonds, foreign currencies and the dollar. The Treasury secretary is an important member of the president’s Cabinet. Treasury oversees the Internal Revenue Service, and its leader is charged with managing an   workforce. The Treasury secretary traditionally is the primary spokesperson and leader on the economy in a normal administration  —   not the Federal Reserve chair, who was previously relied on. Many on both sides of the aisle welcome the tax cuts and are in favor of Mnuchin, but it takes just a few to slow the wheels of confirmation. One of Mnuchin’s jobs is simply to make doing business in America more lucrative, thereby putting more money in workers’ pockets through growth. And that’s a huge win for workers. It’s precisely the extra cash in the pockets of American businesses and workers that will help ignite the growth in our country. Problem is, it’s nearly impossible to make meaningful tax policy without a Treasury secretary."

The fire started around 1 a. m. on the second floor of a   building on Summit Avenue near 14th Street in Union City, according to Fire Chief Frank Montagne, of the North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue. The building is both commercial and residential, but the fire broke out on a residential floor, he said. The fire likely started on the second floor of 1404 Summit and then high winds spread the blaze to 1406 and 1408 Summit Ave, officials said. Daniel Peek, 44, a truck driver who witnessed the fire, said he saw the child’s father desperately trying to save his son. “There was a man on fire, his back was on fire,” Peek said. “He was trying to get the fire escape to come down so he could go in. He was burning. I couldn’t watch that. I had to turn my back. ” The father was taken to a nearby hospital for severe burns and smoke inhalation, Montagne said. A nearby church, Sts.

Fire took hold of the church and got into roof of the structure. ” Winds out of the northwest were gusting up to 30 miles per hour around midnight, an Accuweather spokesman said. Peek called the blaze “the perfect storm. ” “The fire was blowing and burning debris was falling to the ground,” he said. “A car exploded in front of the church  …    the power lines came down, the transformer exploded.

A dusting with Saviano carries the same $325 price tag as a regular cut, although the process takes a few minutes longer. “It’s a little bit harder, because it has to be really precisely done,” Saviano says. Dusting is done on dry hair, so an appointment at his salon includes a wash and   beforehand. Gregorio Ruggeri, owner of Salon Ruggeri near Madison Square Park, does a quicker dust than Saviano, typically when his clients come in for color appointments. The treatment is complimentary and tacks on only a extra few minutes.

Department spokesman Mark Toner said Thursday that Secretary of State Tillerson decided in early February to recuse himself from TransCanada’s application. He has not worked on it at the State Department and will “play no role in the deliberations or ultimate resolution” of the application."
84616,127097,Texas lawmaker files bill that penalizes men for masturbating,New York Post,Chris Perez,2017-03-13,2017.0,3.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170314005138/http://nypost.com/2017/03/13/texas-lawmaker-files-bill-that-penalizes-men-for-masturbating/
","A Texas lawmaker has filed a bill that would fine men $100 for masturbating  —   declaring it “an act against an unborn child. ” Rep. Jessica Farrar introduced the legislation on Friday in the attempt to satirize current laws and shed light on the gap between reproductive health care regulations for men and women, “Although HB 4260 is satirical, there is nothing funny about current health care restrictions for women and the very real legislation that is proposed every legislative session,” the Houston Democrat wrote in a statement on Facebook. The bill, dubbed the “Man’s Right to Know Act,” contains provisions that would also put restrictions on vasectomies, Viagra prescriptions and colonoscopies. “[The legislation] mirrors real TX laws and health care restrictions faced by TX women every #txlege session,” Farrar tweeted Saturday. Under Texas state law, women who want to get abortions are issued a pamphlet called “A Woman’s Right to Know” and forced to take a transvaginal ultrasound before the procedure. Some of the bill’s other provisions include similar guidelines, such as a required rectal exam. There’s even a rule stating that “masturbatory emissions” be stored “for the wife for conception. ” Farrar, who is an outspoken advocate of abortion rights, ultimately labels masturbation as an “act against an unborn child” that fails “to preserve the sanctity of life. ” She proposes that men be fined $100 if they’re caught pleasuring themselves. “What I would like to see is this make people stop and think,”  “Maybe my colleagues aren’t capable of that, but the people who voted for them, or the people that didn’t vote at all, I hope that it changes their mind and helps them to decide what the priorities are. ” Republican lawmakers criticized the “Man’s Right to Know Act” after it was filed last week. “I’m embarrassed for Representative Farrar,” Rep. Tony Tinderholt, of Arlington, told the Tribune. “Her attempt to compare [HB 4260] to the abortion issue shows a lack of a basic understanding of human biology,” he said. “I would recommend that she consider taking a high school biology class from a local public or charter school before filing another bill on the matter. ”"

","So   …     what’s it like when the fantasy of anyone who ever has picked up a basketball becomes real life instead  —   and, better, becomes   real life? What’s it like to transfer a thousand days in your driveway  —   dribbling down the clock, doing the    counting the clock down, 4   …     3   …     2   …     1  —   into your own hands? “In the driveway,” Florida’s Chris Chiozza said, “I think you miss more than you make. ” This was just past 3 o’clock on Saturday afternoon, meaning it was just more than 14 hours since Chiozza had  . Fourteen hours earlier, with exactly 4. 0 seconds left in the East Region semifinals, trailing Wisconsin by two, Chiozza had taken an inbounds pass from Canyon Barry, and he had clicked his internal stopwatch. Four seconds, with his speed, meant he could take at least four dribbles. Maybe five. Start there: How many times in a basketball season  —   college, pro, doesn’t matter the level  —   do you see a player with zero understanding of just how much time four seconds really is? They wind up taking a   heave, or rifling an   prayer from 35 feet, and only later realize they had more time to play with? Not Chiozza. “We scrimmage that every day,” the Gators’ junior point guard said. “You’re up a point, or down a point, you take the ball out of bounds, four or five seconds to go. ” Four dribbles into his journey, Chiozza peeked at the clock, saw there were still 1. 6 seconds left in the game, realized he could take a fifth dribble to give himself something resembling balance and  . Left foot first, then right, and then he lurched over the   line and let it fly. In one corner, Devin Robinson instinctively had cut to the basket, and for a   thought Chiozza might be lofting a lob pass in his direction. And then he realized something else. “Holy snap!” he thought. “This might go in!” On the bench, Justin Leon watched and sent a mental memorandum to a higher authority. “Please, God,” the senior forward said, “don’t let my career be over yet. ” Chiozza? He wasn’t sure how to feel, truth be told. “It felt good coming out of my hand,” he said. “I knew it had a chance. ” Then: “It looked like it was going in   …    ” And then it went in. Robinson was the first to greet him, squeezing him in a hug, keeping him stationary until the rest of the Gators could speed over and form a scrum. Devastated Wisconsin players immediately shot glances to the Garden scoreboard, hoping against hope to see testimony that Chiozza had either gotten the shot off late or, at the least, shot the ball inside the arc. Nope. And nope. The ball left his hand with 0. 6 seconds left. His left foot clearly was behind the stripe. It was right. It was real. It was ridiculous. “Disbelief,” Chiozza said. The next 14 hours were surreal, same as the next 14 years will be, and the next 40. When he got back to his locker, he discovered close to 300 text messages on his iPhone. “I heard from everybody I’ve ever met,” he said, laughing. How do you come down from that? You don’t. You go back to the hotel, you take a hot shower, you watch the replay of the shot a couple of dozen times, you try to get some sleep, you fail, you click on the television, you settle on the movie “Neighbors,” you ponder what this all means in the big picture. “I think in 20 years, it’ll be exciting for my kids to see their dad make that shot,” he said. But it is more than that, of course. The day barely had dawned when former Florida quarterback Danny Wuerffel posted a picture of his son trying to replicate Chiozza’s  . You had better believe he wasn’t the only one doing that in playgrounds and gymnasiums all across America on Saturday. Chiozza was asked which would be the harder shot in a game of     : his clinching floater, or the        3 that Wisconsin’s Zak Showalter hit at the end of regulation, after he nearly tripped and then   a   off his wrong foot. Chiozza thought about that a second, and smiled. “I think mine was a little harder,” he said."

86240,129120,Aaron Hernandez found not guilty of double murder,New York Post,Associated Press,2017-04-14,2017.0,4.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170415011024/http://nypost.com/2017/04/14/aaron-hernandez-found-not-guilty-of-double-murder/
","BOSTON  —     star Aaron Hernandez, who is already serving a life sentence for a 2013 murder, was acquitted Friday in a 2012 double slaying prosecutors said was fueled by his anger over a spilled drink. The former tight end for the New England Patriots wept quietly as the verdicts were read in Boston. A few moments later, he looked back at his fiancee and nodded somberly as relatives of the victims sobbed loudly. The jury found Hernandez not guilty of   murder in the killings of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. It convicted him of a single charge: unlawful possession of gun. The judge sentenced him to an additional four to five years in prison, separate from his existing life sentence, for that conviction. Prosecutors said Hernandez opened fire on their car because he felt disrespected when one of the men bumped into him and spilled his drink at a Boston nightclub. The defense team pointed the finger at Alexander Bradley, a close friend of Hernandez who was with him the night of the shootings. Hernandez was also acquitted Friday of shooting Bradley in the face months later to try to silence him as a witness. Hernandez, 27, is already serving a life sentence for the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, a   football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez’s fiancee. Bradley claimed Hernandez became enraged after de Abreu bumped into him while dancing, spilling his drink. He said Hernandez later opened fire on the men’s car as they waited at a stoplight. Bradley also said Hernandez shot him in the face months later after he made a remark about the earlier shootings. Bradley lost his right eye in the shooting. Hernandez’s lawyers said it was Bradley  —   an admitted drug dealer  —   who shot the men over a drug deal. The defense hammered at Bradley’s credibility, citing his immunity deal with prosecutors to testify against Hernandez, his role as the driver of the car the night of the shootings and his criminal record. Bradley is serving a   prison term in Connecticut for firing shots at a Hartford nightclub in 2014. Hernandez grew up in Bristol, Connecticut, and played for the Patriots from 2010 to 2012. About six weeks after Furtado and de Abreu were killed, Hernandez signed a   $40 million contract with the Patriots and went on to play another season before Lloyd was killed. He was cut from the team shortly after he was arrested in Lloyd’s killed in June 2013. He was not charged in the 2012 killings until 2014. In his first trial, jurors deliberated for 36 hours over seven days before convicting him of murder. Jurors in the trial that concluded Friday deliberated for about 37 hours."
86312,129199,Phil Jackson wresting control of Knicks back from Jeff Hornacek,New York Post,Marc Berman,2017-04-15,2017.0,4.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170416002622/http://nypost.com/2017/04/15/phil-jackson-wresting-control-of-knicks-back-from-jeff-hornacek/
","The Knicks’ new coaching lineup is this: Kurt Rambis is associate head coach, Jeff Hornacek is head coach, and Phil Jackson is now ready to become   . It is unclear who will have the most influence. Across Friday’s   press conference, the Knicks president made three things clear for next season: He wants the triangle around, he doesn’t want Carmelo Anthony around, and he wants to be around the team more as “an   mentor. ’’ In fact, Jackson took partial blame for the team’s tailspin around the holidays when he took a West Coast respite. None of his remarks bode well for Hornacek, who could be on a short leash next season in the second year of his   deal. Rambis still is the apple of Jackson’s eye. Jackson had more positive things to say about Rambis, the previous season’s interim head coach whom he nearly promoted to the permanent spot, than he did Hornacek. Though Jackson called Hornacek “a young coach’’ with just “2   years’’ of experience entering the   season, he said Rambis “has all the knowledge that I have. ’’ According to sources, Jackson hired Hornacek over Rambis because he was younger with a potentially better rapport with the   player than Rambis.  However, the collapse at Christmas caused an unhappy locker room and Kristaps Porzingis’ decision to boycott his exit meeting underlined his massive frustration with how matters were handled.  Jackson said Friday there was “some disconnect at times with this team and rebelliousness that created some of the discord during the year. ’’ That’s on Hornacek. And that will be why, more than in his first three failed seasons, Jackson will be helping out Hornacek. “I think that one of the things I like about this job is that [general manager] Steve Mills, [director of basketball operations] Jamie Matthews do a lot of the paperwork  —   the back and forth with NBA headquarters and my issues is about talking to coaches, finding out the game plan,’’ Jackson said. “I think that I left them alone to see how they were going to perform this year in a way, took some time on the West Coast during the holidays when I think things really kind of fell down over New Year’s and the subsequent week after New Year’s. So I think I’ve got to do a little bit more on scene, on target mentoring. I probably will. ’’ Jackson likes the word “mentoring,” hates the word “meddling’’ and said his recent triangle clinic with the guards mostly was for Derrick Rose’s benefit, because of his “disconnect’’ with the system. Jackson said he believes his hire came with the notion he would lend his coaching expertise after winning an   11 titles. Because coaches “are in front of teams an inordinate amount of time,’’ Jackson has said, their remarks become “gilded’’ and a fresh voice can be useful as reinforcement. “When you sit back on the position I’m at, I get on the court, a couple of times I’ve had to stop practice and say, ‘Hold it, we can’t play that way,’ just to emphasize what the coaches are trying to say,’’ Jackson said. “There is a point where you have to be there with the players and actually stop them, so I’ve tried to do some of that but not intrude in the coaches’ direction, That is something that has to be done because as I’ve said a few times, we have to know who we are, what we stand for and how we’re going to play. ’’ Jackson, who attended just four road games last season (Los Angeles twice, Golden State, Brooklyn) talked an inordinate amount about why he will insist on the triangle and explained he had Hornacek move further toward his system before the   Break. “I let Jeff do what he wanted to do  —   an agreement to try to blend what we call whatever that flow, fastbreak, early shooting offense into something formatted,’’ Jackson said. “We kind of let it roll until things didn’t roll well before we [said it] looks like we need some more fundamentals, more function towards the end of a game. They showed at the end of season they started being able to do some of that. ’’  Rambis got put in charge of the sickly defense early in the season, Jackon said, because he was the most “outspoken’’ assistant in that area. He also coached the Lakers’ defense during part of Jackson’s run. However, next season Rambis’ offensive influence increases.  Shaquille O’Neal recently said Jackson misses the ailing Tex Winter in enforcing triangle concepts. Next season, Hornacek will get more help from the   triangle monster of Rambis and Jackson. "
86648,129667,Why can’t the Clintons just go away?,New York Post,Maureen Callahan,2017-04-22,2017.0,4.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170423021820/http://nypost.com/2017/04/22/why-cant-the-clintons-just-go-away/
","Since losing the most winnable presidential election in modern American history, Hillary Clinton has, among other things: given a series of   speeches,   refused to rule out   and issued an online video message exhorting fellow Democrats to fight on in her name. “The challenges we face,” she said, “as a country and a party, are real. ” Clearly, Hillary still sees herself as the leader of the Democratic Party. And why shouldn’t she? Democrats have been locked in an abusive relationship with the Clintons for decades, enabling, explaining, convincing themselves that next time will be different. Party faithful hew to Hillary’s excuses for losing to Donald Trump: It’s James Comey’s fault, plus the Russians, white supremacists, misogynists, the deplorables and immobilized millennials, among other things. Her losses in 2008 and 2016 have been framed as things that happened   Hillary  —   not one, but two Black Swan events that stymied her historic destiny. How is it that Democrats have fealty here, let alone sympathy? How is it that Hillary routinely walks into standing ovations at Broadway theaters? Where is the realization that Hillary is to blame or the rational rejection of a   loser? Any debate about what happened last November ends with Tuesday’s publication of   Journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes spent the past two years talking to Hillary’s most trusted advisers, and what emerges is damning. Every mistake made in her 2008 run was compounded in 2016: the paranoia, the staff infighting, the underestimation of the   wild card, the   the failure to connect with average voters, the belief that because it was her turn the presidency would be hers. It’s “Groundhog Day” with global consequences. According to “Shattered,” after a year spent crisscrossing the country, “Hillary still couldn’t figure out why Americans were so angry. ” Jon Favreau, Obama’s favorite speechwriter, lasted with Hillary mere weeks, quitting before she even formally announced. She has no clear reason for running, Favreau told her staff. She has no clear vision for the country and can’t answer two simple questions: Why her, and why now? By late 2015, Hillary told an aide she still had no idea what voters needed. “I’m really trying to put my finger on what the electorate, the Democratic primary electorate, the broader electorate is thinking and feeling right now. ” By then, the US economy had been decimated for seven years. Unemployment was stagnant, with 7. 5 million Americans without work. One of every 122 homes had been foreclosed. More than 33, 000 Americans died as a result of the opioid epidemic. An average of 20 veterans committed suicide per day. There was no shortage of issues. Where is the realization that Hillary is to blame or the rational rejection of a   loser? Similarly, Hillary didn’t get why Bernie Sanders was resonating. Her worst defenses kicked in, fertilized by her top aides. “From the Clinton campaign’s perspective,” the authors write, Bernie “was getting an even easier ride from the media than Obama had in 2008. ”  indicates that she’s learned nothing. She posts about social issues and identity politics through the prism of her loss. She remains woefully out of touch and she still doesn’t get what her husband did way back in 1992: It’s the economy, stupid. Unless deprived of oxygen, Hillary and her cohort will press on, further retarding party progress. Stars such as Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand are fighting for column inches, airtime and party dominance as the Clintons stubbornly remain. Two weeks ago, reports surfaced that Huma Abedin, long viewed by Hillary’s top aides as a major liability,  Given that the book has Hillary’s blessing, and that Abedin’s husband,    —      —   who really thinks she’s going to spill anything? It smacks of Abedin’s environment: another grubby   cash grab, promising something she’ll never deliver. Chelsea Clinton, meanwhile, is reportedly being groomed for a congressional seat and this week appeared on the cover of Variety as a “Woman of Power. ” She’s never looked happier, and she’s never attempted to look so hip, outfitted in jeans, a white   and black leather jacket. Who could she be hoping to reach? “This is not the time to be silent or stay on the sidelines,” Chelsea said. In true Clintonian   she’s ruling out a run for office while continuing to raise her profile, offering   platitudes to heartbroken Dems. “Talk about what’s really at risk in this moment,” she said. “Raise your voice and help others raise their voices. ” It’s a version of her mother’s intransigence, the refusal to admit voters have rejected this brand twice and to act with resultant humility. According to “Shattered,” Hillary’s repeated refusal to apologize for anything  —   most notably the use of her private server while secretary of state  —   was one of her most frustrating faults. Her closest aides kept pushing early on for a sincere apology to the American people, but Hillary remained defiant. In fact, the only time her aides heard   after her loss was indisputable. Even then, President Obama had to urge her to concede. “Mr. President,” Hillary said, “I’m sorry. ” It’s an apology Hillary owes her supporters, who have stuck through two ostensible “ ” runs for president. And then Hillary and the   Clinton dynasty should do the right thing and just go  —   before the party, like the weary American electorate, is forced to show them the door."

","In the future, you’ll want to implant a tiny computer into your brain in order to keep computers from becoming the “other. ” If that sounds creepy and contradictory, consider that the alternative may be obsolescence or even annihilation at the hands of artificial intelligence and robot technology, warns Elon Musk. The tech billionaire took to Twitter on Sunday to answer questions about his new   startup, Neuralink, which he had said on Friday is working to create   devices that will link the human brain with a machine interface. Asked by a Twitter user whether Neuralink was a counter to “Skynet”  —   the fictional AI system from the “Terminator” movies that sought to stamp out humans because they were dangerous  —     “That is the aspiration: to avoid AI becoming other. ” Neuralink is aiming to bring to the market a product that helps with certain severe brain injuries due to stroke, cancer lesion etc, in about four years, Musk said in an interview last week  website . “If I were to communicate a concept to you, you would essentially engage in consensual telepathy,” Musk said in the interview published on Thursday. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will create computers so sophisticated and godlike that humans will need to implant “neural laces” in their brains to keep up, Musk said in a tech conference last year. “There are a bunch of concepts in your head that then your brain has to try to compress into this incredibly low data rate called speech or typing,” Musk said in the latest interview. “If you have two brain interfaces, you could actually do an uncompressed direct conceptual communication with another person. ” The technology could take about eight to 10 years to become usable by people with no disability, which would depend heavily on regulatory approval timing and how well the devices work on people with disabilities, Musk was quoted as saying. In March, the Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had launched a company through which computers could merge with human brains. Neuralink was registered in California as a “medical research” company last July, and he plans on funding the company mostly by himself."

Nicole Harper said flight attendants told her she couldn’t leave her seat until the captain turned off the Fasten Seatbelt sign April 10  —   one day after  . “After explaining that I have an overactive bladder and would either need to use the restroom or pee in a cup, I was handed a cup by flight attendants,” Harper   Saturday. The mother of two initially tried using the bathroom on Flight 6056 but was ordered back to her seat, she  . “I said, ‘I’m going to need to use the restroom or I’m going to need a cup.’ They handed me the cup which was about this big and I was like, ‘I’m going to need a second cup,’” Harper said. “I don’t know if they just didn’t understand that I don’t have any control over the situation. ” But the embarrassing situation only got worse, claims Harper, an ER nurse by profession.

The home, known as Tick Hall in Montauk, is owned by famed talk show host  . “There are bigger houses, and houses with more bells and whistles,” Cavett told The Post in an email. “But there is not a more magical place in all the world. ” Cavett first rented the property, at 165 Deforest Road, in the 1960s with his wife, the late actress Carrie Nye, before they bought it outright. “You must remember,” Nye  . “Tick Hall is not a fancy house. It’s a simple country house by the sea. ” (Nye, who married Cavett in 1964, died of lung cancer in 2006.) The    property, with seven bedrooms and five bathrooms, sits on 19 acres overlooking the ocean and comes with 900 feet on the Atlantic. It’s bordered to the east by more than 170 acres of oceanfront parkland. A private path winds to an oceanfront cove, known locally as “Cavett’s Cove,” according to the listing. There’s also a freshwater pond, a pool and a canopied trail with ocean views. The classic shingled estate was the last of seven homes known as the “Seven Sisters,” which were designed by Stanford White’s fabled firm, McKim, Mead & White. (The architect’s famous NYC buildings include the Brooklyn Museum and Columbia University’s central campus.) 165 Deforest Road was built between 1881 and 1883, shortly after the firm launched in 1879. Known as the Montauk Point Association Houses, the seven homes came with a clubhouse and were built in a cluster as simple hunting and fishing cottages for rich New Yorkers. Frederick Law Olmsted, one of Central Park’s designers, planned the site. Fast forward a century. The home  —   and five generations worth of Nye’s family heirlooms  —   burned to the ground in a devastating fire in 1997, which was likely caused by repairmen fixing the roof. Guests over the years  —   Cavett has been there for more than 50  —   have included Woody Allen, Mick and Bicanca Jagger, Andy Warhol, Dustin Hoffman, Edward Albee, Tennessee Williams and Robert Redford. Cavett and Nye then vowed to rebuild an exact replica of their former home, relying on photographs and their memories, since there were no plans. They even used their pet dogs to recreate window heights, based on how high the dogs had jumped as reflected in photos. Their experience rebuilding their beloved home was memorialized in a 2003 documentary, “ . ” Guests over the years  —   Cavett has been there for more than 50  —   have included Woody Allen, Mick and Bicanca Jagger, Andy Warhol, Dustin Hoffman, Edward Albee, Tennessee Williams and Robert Redford. One time, Muhammed Ali stayed over. “My late wife called the house one afternoon from NYC, and said ‘Darlin’? ’” Cavett recalled. “Ali answered the phone, and said “This ain’t ‘Darlin.’ It’s the only   heavyweight champion of the world, and I’m lyin’ in your bed and watchin’ your TV!” Tick Hall was originally named The Orr House, after Alexander Orr, who built the house and spent summers with his family here. Later, the house was owned by Harrison Tweed, a top Wall Street lawyer with Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy. “It was he and his wife who named the house Tick Hall, after the   arachnids all over the east coast; the men who visited the house were ‘ticks,’ including ‘Tick Roosevelt,’ and the women were ‘tickesses’ and the children were ‘tickettes,’ Cavett said. “It was 1924, and the house had no water or electricity. The Tweeds added the bell tower and put on a small addition with a kitchen downstairs and three bathrooms upstairs. I bought the house from Harrison and Barbara Tweed when he was 91. It was sheer luck that got me into this place; it has, until now, passed from hand to hand. It’s never been on the market in its   history. We just hope the next owners love it as much as we do. ” Corcoran’s Karen Kelley and Tim Davis have the listing, as first reported in the Wall Street Journal."

","The union that represents about 400 journalists at the New York Times on Wednesday blasted a move by the newspaper to abolish a whole layer of editors  —   while eliminating the public editor position entirely. “The announcement that the New York Times will be offering buyouts and eliminating editors  —   including the public editor  —   is devastating to our members and grave news for the state of journalism,” said Grant Glickson, president of the NewsGuild, the Gray Lady’s single largest union. “The Times is supposed to be a leader in our industry,” said Glickson, “and though heartened to hear they intend to invest more in reporters and content, it comes at an unfortunate cost. ” The public editor job was hatched in the wake of the Jayson Blair plagiarism scandal 2003 to restore public trust. Blair was a young reporter who plagiarized or made up dozens of stories over a period of several years. Liz Spayd, the public editor since last summer, will exit on Friday, according to a memo from Times Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. In a separate 2   page memo to staffers, Executive Editor Dean Baquet and Managing Editor Joe Kahn said the company was going to eliminate a layer of copy editors and what are known as “backfielders,” who work with journalists in shaping stories. They will be replaced with a single group of editors. “A new model of edition will end the distinction between backfielders and copy editors,’ said Baquet and Kahn in the memo. “One group of editors will handle all aspects of a story, with a separate set of eyes looking over their shoulders before publication,” they said."

","A second Princess Diana is set to dominate the headlines this summer  —   this one a crusading DC Comics superhero. The fictional Diana, an Amazonian princess, is the star of Warner Bros.’ “Wonder Woman,” a film headed on Friday for an opening weekend of more than $115 million, according to industry estimates. With favorable buzz building all week, the box office could swell even further into blockbuster territory. Just four days ago, tracking experts suggested the $150 million movie would do a respectable $65 million open. For Kevin Tsujihara, head of the Time   studio, the timing of the likely hit couldn’t be better. After Warner Bros.’ “The Accountant” bombed last fall and the $125 million “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword” pulled in just $36 million in US box office receipts in its first three weeks, the studio sat in fourth place in tickets sold, according to BoxOfficeMojo. “Wonder Woman,” starring Gal Gadot, is the first   superhero movie with a female lead to be directed by a woman  —   Patty Jenkins. The feisty but vulnerable Princess of the Amazon looks set to blow away box office receipts of male superheroes from “Spiderman” to “Thor. ” “The Amazing Spiderman 2” took in $92 million in its opening weekend in 2014. “Thor” did $65. 7 million in its opening foray in 2011. Film fans appear to be in the mood for a   ensemble story. After several women’s marches and more visible efforts to fight for gender equality, Warner Bros. president of worldwide marketing and distribution Sue Kroll told The Post on Thursday that now is the “perfect time in the culture for this movie. ” Kroll noted that the   ratio of people intending to see the movie is   and is equally young and old. Marketing info is showing that the movie is transcending the “superhero” category, Kroll said. Some bloggers criticized Warner for failing to market “Wonder Woman” on a par with other superhero franchises. Its marketing also came in for some criticism due to   with diet products such as ThinkThin. Still, review site Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 92 percent positive review Thursday.  and described it as a “  for DC Comics and for female superhero movies. ” ComScore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian predicted the movie “will be a hot property in terms of merchandising. ” Walmart and Target both list “Wonder Woman” products on their sites, and Amazon is set to release a fashion collection Friday. Later this summer, the media is sure to remember the 20th anniversary of the beloved (British) Princess Di’s death in Paris. But for the next several weeks, the more popular Diana will be the one on 4, 165 screens across the US. The “Wonder” excitement has even penetrated the White House, which has requested a copy of the film, sources said. The summer box office season needs a lift. As of Thursday, ticket sales were down 9 percent from last year, according to comScore."

","Stefano Giovannini Stefano Giovannini Stefano Giovannini View Slideshow For New York City’s strays, this guy is the cat’s meow. Charlie, a    house cat living on the Upper West Side, is the ASPCA’s top foster dad in the city. Over the past five years, this    feline has helped raise 25 foster kittens, cuddling, grooming and getting them emotionally and physically ready for adoption. “He’s so wonderful with the kittens,” Charlie’s owner, Chandler Alteri, told The Post, adding that many of the animals she and Charlie foster have special needs. “He lets them fake nurse with him. He cleans them. Sometimes he bops them around, like training them to stand up for themselves and be independent. He teaches things I can’t. ” Charlie himself was a foster, found in 2010 with his siblings in a box near Alteri’s parents’ home in Nashville, Tenn. When Alteri’s mom offered him up, she couldn’t say no. “My roommates and I lived with three dogs, and Charlie loved them,” said Alteri, who is now 27 and a TV producer. After seeing him with the other pets she decided to foster kittens once she had her own place. Upon moving to New York with Charlie in 2012, Alteri got her first ASPCA fosters, Bitsy and Jitterbug. Charlie immediately went into caretaker mode. “He started bathing them and being supergentle,” said Alteri of the trio’s first meeting. “They were kind of shy, [but] when they saw how Charlie was with me, they started trusting me. ” Alteri and Charlie keep fosters between three weeks and three months, depending on the kittens’ needs. They’ve cared for blind cats and amputees. One had cerebellar hypoplasia  —   a neurological condition that causes motor skills problems. “Charlie would clean him after he went to the bathroom or after getting food all over his face,” said Alteri. “I would sob watching them. ” Gail Buchwald, senior vice president of the ASPCA Adoption Center, said, “Charlie is very friendly and that makes him a good  . He serves as a bridge to help fearful kittens begin to allow people to get close to them. ” Charlie even has a   girlfriend, Lola, who lives with Alteri’s mom in Nashville. “One of my mom’s other cats tried to attack Lola once, and Charlie ran and jumped in front of her to save her,” said Alteri. “Now he won’t leave Lola’s side when we visit. ” Charlie  —   who has    —    is waiting for his next kitten to arrive this week. While he does seem to miss the cats once they are adopted, Alteri said it helps that “he gets a new toy after every foster. ”"

They came to my debut show during New York Fashion Week and liked my work,” Berryman tells The Post. “I then had the honor to work with them on the custom shirt for Gaga. ” Being plucked by a star as major as Mother Monster could mark a huge turning point for the   designer. The “Born This Way” singer’s former stylist, Brandon Maxwell, became a household name among the fashion set after just three seasons.   A post shared by xoxo, Gaga (@ladygaga) on  “It’s hard to top [dressing Lady Gaga] an artist I have such respect for,” Berryman says. But who else is on the designer’s bucket list? “I would die to dress Rihanna and Beyoncé,” Berryman says. “It’s not so much about dressing a celebrity that’s exciting, but it’s collaborating with another artist that understands my work. That’s the most exciting part. ” For Berryman, it’s the clothes, not the spotlight, that’s close to his heart. “I design everything, my work is very personal to me. I pattern and construct every garment. When a stylist needs custom looks in three days, I’m up all night sewing away,” he says. “Artists must be obsessed with the ritual [and] the result. ” Berryman’s own aesthetic is a result of his experience of growing up as a gay teenager in Tennessee. “I created a world for myself in the music I listened to, it comforted me. The clothes were about making armor to defend yourself from the world. LGBTQ people are so brave even through all the pain. That’s what inspires me most and what gives my designs their romantically goth quality,” he says. Ironically, the very thing that Berryman used to protect himself is what has launched him into the mainstream. “I keep going because I know what I have to say with my work could be important for others, and I want to show people it is OK to be yourself!” The designer wants people to know one thing about his work: “It comes from a place of unconditional love for others. ”"
90151,134938,Why swearing around kids isn’t as bad as you think,New York Post,Joshua David Stein,2016-10-15,2016.0,10.0,http://nypost.com/2016/10/15/why-swearing-around-kids-isnt-as-bad-as-you-think/,"Raising two small boys in the city is a frustrating endeavor. Driving two small boys around the city is even harder. When the two activities converge, as they did on a recent gridlocked Saturday trip to the Brooklyn Children’s Museum, there can be only curse words. So when the boys ignored my pleas to cool it in the back seat and the green taxi in the abutting lane refused to let me merge, I muttered a string of   words that are here unprintable. Shortly afterwards, my    asked, “Daddy, what’s ‘Argh oh f —  k?’ ” Among the many tributaries that contribute to the flood of guilt raising a child creates, exposing them to swear words falls somewhere between a babbling brook and a murmuring creek. Happily, Benjamin K. Bergen, a professor of cognitive science at the University of California at San Diego and the author of the new book,   reveals that dropping the   around kids isn’t the end of the world. As he writes, “Children’s minds are resilient to profanity. ” It’s an important conclusion, not simply for a father looking to feel marginally less crummy about his parenting   but also for a society that punishes those who cuss around kids. Bergen relates the story of Danielle Wolff, a mother in North Carolina who in 2014 was arrested for telling her husband in front of her children at the grocery store, “Stop squishing the f —  king bread!” And then there’s Elizabeth Venable, a Ph. D. student in Southern California, who was charged with disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace for cussing within earshot of small children at an airport in 2006. In his book, Bergen thoroughly debunks a study published in the medical journal Pediatrics and cited by, among others, the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2011, that argues swearing is harmful to children. The authors of the study claim that exposure to profanity both numbs children emotionally and causes immediate negative physiological reactions like increased heart rate and shallow breathing. But Bergen eviscerates this argument by showing, first, that the findings on emotional numbness were based on a study that actually examined television violence, not profanity. And while foul language does cause an increase in heart rate and shallow breathing, you know what else does? Solving difficult math problems, texting and computer games. There is an effect, Bergen argues, but it isn’t necessarily negative. Much of the taboo around swearing, says Bergen, comes from the tendency to lump profanity in with verbal abuse. As a 2010 study of thousands of Scandinavian teenagers showed, children exposed to verbal abuse are more likely to “report psychological problems like depression, anxiety, aggression and hyperactivity. ” But Bergen points out that verbal abuse and cursing are not the same. Like all words, he notes, “You can use profanity positively, and you can use ‘clean’ language abusively. ” In fact, he says, profanity is used aggressively only about 10 percent of the time. The rest of the time it’s used for things like humor and building bonhomie. Obscenities like f —  k and   Bergen writes, can act as simple ejaculations of emotion and an emphatic underlining of sentiment. Neither are inherently abusive, or for that matter, inherently anything. My outburst on Ocean Parkway, for instance, is better than telling my son to “Go the f —  k to sleep!” and marginally worse than telling him, “I f —  king love you so much, little dude!” It is a completely different species altogether from telling the kid, “F —  k you” which is shudderingly terrible  —   but no worse than telling him he’s worthless. ‘Obscenities like f —  k and   Bergen writes, can act as simple ejaculations of emotion and an emphatic underlining of sentiment.’ Bergen also points out that not all curse words are created equal. He divides them into four categories, what he calls the “Holy, F —  king,   N —  ger Principle. ” According to this rule, all swear words  —   not just in English but in all languages  —   can be classified as blasphemy (Holy); fornication (F —  king) defecation ( ) or the denigration of a group of people according to their ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, etc. In America, the   and other slurs are among the most offensive. But even then, the toxicity of some slurs isn’t so much due to the words themselves  —   some of which can even be used as terms of empowerment  —   but in the hateful value universe that gives the words meaning. And if you’re using those words around your child, profanity is the least of your problems anyway. In short, “What The F” argues that if you let a curse word slip in front of the   mind of your child, in traffic or at Fairway or even watching the Giants lose (again) don’t beat yourself up about it. Swear words won’t infect your child’s mind with violence and doom them to depression. At the same time, refraining from profanity in no way insulates you from being a terrible parent. You can be   mean with a   vocabulary. If  —   and when  —   you f —  k up and utter a word like “f —  k,” remember, it’s not those four letters that matter as much as the words around it. So explain yourself. Back in New York traffic, I told my    that I said those naughty words because I was frustrated. “Oh,” he responded, “we just read a book about that at school. When you’re frustrated, you can ask for help!” Suddenly, merging into traffic seemed to matter less and a smile spread across my face. It was a blessing, brought on by a curse."

The rivalry that spawned from a vicious Week 15 game still has a few embers glowing, as the Giants star wide receiver seemed to take a bit of secondhand pleasure in Norman allowing a touchdown on Sunday. In an eventual   Carolina triumph, Seattle mounted a   comeback in the NFC   playoff. With the clock ticking in the fourth quarter and down   Russell Wilson scrambled around, evading a few charging Panthers, before releasing a lollipop prayer to Jermaine Kearse. As the ball wobbled its way through the air toward the back of the end zone, Norman gave a desperate jump for the ball, which sailed right over his outstretched hand. Kearse corralled it for a  ’   touchdown, although Seattle’s upset bid would fall short. Russell Wilson gets away the pressure just enough and finds Jermaine Kearse for the touchdown.   —   MarcusD (@_MarcusD_)  Still, it was a moment for Beckham to (quietly) relish after a season in which he established himself as one of the league’s premier stars, but one who needs to mature. The temper questions stem from that Dec. 20   loss, in which Beckham was issued three personal foul penalties, including one for launching himself, helmet first, at Norman after a play. But as the Carolina cornerback couldn’t reach this pass? Beckham could enjoy this.

91291,136179,Matt Harvey might miss Opening Day — and Mets can’t say why,New York Post,Mike Puma,2016-03-28,2016.0,3.0,http://nypost.com/2016/03/28/a-hint-of-matt-harvey-mystery-with-medical-absence/,"JUPITER, Fla.  —   A relatively   Mets spring training added a twist of drama Monday, when the club disclosed Matt Harvey could miss his Opening Day start because of an ailment that has arisen. Mets officials would not disclose the ailment  —   other than to say it was    —   but Harvey was scratched from his final scheduled exhibition start Tuesday as the club awaited test results. “It is not orthopedic  —   his arm is fine,” manager Terry Collins said. “His arm is fine. ” Harvey celebrated his 27th birthday Sunday and team officials were originally wary the righty had partied too much when he called in sick Monday morning. But after Harvey described his symptoms to the team’s medical staff, he was sent for examination by a doctor. “It’s a   issue that he’s got to address and it came up this morning and as a result, he won’t pitch [Tuesday],” general manager Sandy Alderson said. “We’ll just see what happens with   tests and consultation. ” Alderson indicated Harvey was still in Florida, but could be sent to New York for further evaluation if needed. A person with knowledge of Harvey’s medical issue termed it “not major” and indicated the pitcher’s   scenario would be getting pushed back in the rotation or skipping a turn. “If he had to have a wisdom tooth pulled, he wouldn’t pitch [Tuesday] so let’s not jump to conclusions,” Alderson said. Harvey’s absence was conspicuous on a day the entire team traveled to Roger Dean Stadium  —   as a bonding exercise  —   for an exhibition game against the Cardinals. Harvey’s most recent exhibition appearance came Thursday, when he allowed six earned runs over three innings against the Astros. Sean Gilmartin will pitch in his place Tuesday against the Marlins, and Collins can go a variety of directions for Sunday’s opener in Kansas City if needed. “We’re very lucky to have the pitching we’ve got and if [Harvey] can’t go, we’ll have somebody else ready,” Collins said. But Collins, when asked if Monday’s starter, Bartolo Colon, would be a candidate to pitch in Harvey’s place, also warned it was too early to make contingency plans. Jacob deGrom is a logical candidate, but his wife, Stacey, is expecting the couple’s first child next Tuesday, which could preclude the righty from pitching in Kansas City. As it stands, all indications are deGrom will pitch the home opener a week from Friday. “I think it’s a little early to attach any level of concern [on Harvey],” Alderson said. “It’s way too premature for us to be discussing anything related to Opening Day. I understand Opening Day is not too far away, but we’re dealing with [Tuesday] and we should know something more [Tuesday] or the next day. ” In three appearances this spring, Harvey is   with a 6. 30 ERA. Harvey, like the rest of the Mets rotation, rested for an extra week at the beginning of the Grapefruit League schedule to get extra rest after a 2015 season that extended into November because of the team’s World Series appearance. Harvey is not expected to face an innings limitation this season. Last year, in his return from Tommy John surgery, the righty skipped starts in the final two months of the regular season. Harvey pitched 216 innings overall, including the postseason."

A federal judge has tossed a lawsuit accusing the   coffee giant of deceiving customers because its cold beverages contain less liquid than advertised. The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles federal court in June, alleged that Starbuck’s iced drinks “contain significantly less product than advertised. ” Judge Percy Anderson dismissed the suit as ridiculous, saying even a kid knows better. “If children have figured out that including ice in a cold beverage decreases the amount of liquid they will receive, the court has no difficulty concluding that a reasonable consumer would not be deceived into thinking that when they order an iced tea, that the drink they receive will include both ice and tea and that for a given size cup, some portion of the drink will be ice rather than whatever liquid beverage the consumer ordered,” he wrote in his Aug. 19 opinion. The judge also pointed out that Starbucks uses clear cups for cold drinks, making it easy for customers to see how much ice they are getting. Moreover, Starbucks never explicitly states on menus or signs that a given drink size contains a specified amount of liquid, according to the judge. After the suit was filed, Starbucks said customers who are unhappy with their drink can always ask the barista for a new one. They can also ask for light ice or extra ice when placing their order. Starbucks is still facing a similar suit in Illinois that alleges the company underfills iced beverages."

He aims to hit 100 during his lifetime, which we sure hope isn’t cut short during one of these daredevil holidays. “After former President George W. Bush made his infamous ‘axis of evil’ speech, I knew right then that I had to visit every one of those countries  —   Iran, Iraq and North Korea  —   and I did,” McGinlay tells Barcroft. He went to Iran in 2012, noting its border was harder to enter than North Korea’s. But while in Iran, it wasn’t difficult for him to wander into Iraq. “Many of these   dangerous countries do, in fact, turn out to be quite friendly and almost the opposite of our perception from Western media,” he says. “They receive so few visitors from the outside world, the tourists who do venture there are made to feel extra welcome. ” His experiences, though, aren’t always so rosy. While on a mountain hike in Kabul, Afghanistan, McGinlay recorded footage of people shooting at American Black Hawk helicopters. In Syria on a 2010 trip, he was arrested and interrogated over accusations of spying. Once, in New Delhi, he was kidnapped and taken to Kashmir, where his captors  —   who held him for 10 days  —   forced him to smoke opium. He was only 20 years old at the time. But adrenaline, thick skin  —   whatever it is that keeps him going  —   isn’t fizzing out anytime soon. “I’ve invested so much of my life into traveling, and there’s nothing else I would rather be doing,” he tells Barcroft, “so I expect to continue my journey long after the big 100 and well into the future. ”"

Officer Brian Strockbine rescued a man from a burning car and revived two unconscious women over less than two weeks last month, making him the toast of the small southern New Jersey town where he works. “All I was doing was my job,” said Strockbine, 37, of the Evesham Police Department. “On the inside, there was a whole lot of emotions going on, but you’re telling yourself to stay calm and do what you’re trained to do. ” The most eventful month of Stockbine’s career began March 8, when he was the sole responder to an   call of an apparently dead woman on the front lawn of a home on Concord Road. “When I arrived, she was lying there lifeless. Her face was turning blue, and she was foaming out of the mouth,” Strockbine said. “My first instinct was CPR. ” After about three minutes of resuscitation, the    woman’s eyes opened and her pulse returned. She told officers that her husband had beaten her senseless. The man was later arrested. Four days later, on March 12, Strockbine was first on the scene at a car wreck on Route 73. He found a vehicle filling up with smoke. “The doors were locked, and I tried to get the driver to look at me and unlock them, but I couldn’t get him to because he was going in and out of consciousness,” Strockbine said. The cop smashed a car window with a   tool and saved the man. Strockbine later learned that the man had suffered a diabetic emergency. On March 17, the cop went back to playing hero, saving a woman with CPR at a Knox Boulevard home. “I’ve done CPR before and never had that outcome,” he said.

92845,137952,One Vanderbilt mega-office tower picking up steam,New York Post,Steve Cuozzo,2016-03-14,2016.0,3.0,http://nypost.com/2016/03/14/makeover-coming-to-one-vanderbilt-off-to-slow-start/,"One Vanderbilt, SL Green’s brave attempt to make the East 40s office district relevant again, is chugging along  —   slowly but inexorably. Black nets shroud what remains of gloomy old brick buildings on the block bounded by Madison and Vanderbilt avenues and East 42nd and 43rd streets. Demolition has taken down one full corner, and other parts of the site are coming down at about a floor per week. SL Green has bid out the first chunk of $220 million in   upgrades it must complete before it can fully occupy the planned   1. 6 million   tower under terms with the city, according to a source. The skyscraper is scheduled to open in 2021. The $5 million bid for “hard” construction will cover reopening the   “Mobil passageway” linking Grand Central Terminal and the former Mobil building at 150 E. 42d St. More   are expected to follow soon. Also, the developer has filed for an excavation permit with the Buildings Department and is nearing a deal with Tishman Construction to serve as general contractor. SL Green is pressing ahead  —   although it’s   only 200, 000 square feet so far, to TD Bank  —   despite the lingering shadow of Andrew Penson’s $1 billion lawsuit over air rights. Penson, whose Argent Ventures owns Grand Central Terminal’s air rights, claims Green should be required to buy the rights from him. But recent Vanderbilt rezoning allows larger new buildings than current zoning allows in exchange for significant public amenities to be paid for and built by the developer. The city rezoned Vanderbilt Avenue in 2015 as the first step in eventually rezoning a vast,   area bounded roughly by Third and Fifth avenues and 39th and 57th streets. One Vanderbilt is regarded as crucial to putting the juice back into East Midtown  —   once the premier office district but shunned by major tenants who require buildings fresher than the existing stock, which averages 70 years old. Relax, East Midtown landlords who fear losing more   tenants to the far West Side  —   Tishman Speyer is not ready to start building mighty new towers there overnight. The developer announced last week that it had assembled its second site in the Hudson Yards area  —   this one along Eleventh Avenue on the West Side. But sources said Tishman Speyer has no intention of putting up a spec building there, or on a nearby full block it acquired earlier that’s bounded by West 34th and West 35th street between Tenth Avenue and the new Hudson Boulevard. The latter site is one day slated for the Bjarke   “Spiral” with 2. 85 million square feet. Not surprisingly, the developer won’t build without   tenants, insiders said. That might reassure owners of Midtown office towers (not only on the East Side) who’ve seen Time Warner, KKR, Boston Consulting Group and Skadden Arps, among other companies, bolt for Related’s Hudson Yards complex and to Brookfield’s Manhattan West. But Tishman Speyer, Related and Brookfield have one big advantage over Midtown East. Should tenants come along, they can put up new towers right away without waiting for zoning changes  —   or coping with eventualities such as Penson’s lawsuit, which rezoning one small sliver of East Midtown brought about. Mayor de Blasio, Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen and Planning Commissioner Carl Weisbrod have studied rezoning recommendations of a “steering committee” of East Midtown stakeholders. Based partly on their input, City Hall plans to enter a comprehensive proposal into the city’s formal public   review process by the end of the year. It won’t come a minute too soon."

The struggling social network’s stock leaped more than 21 percent Friday on word that it has been in informal merger talks with Google and Salesforce. com. The   talks with Google and Salesforce were coupled with reports Friday that Twitter has tapped Goldman Sachs and Allen & Co. to explore strategic options. Twitter has been the subject of takeover rumors for months as it struggles with stagnant user growth and weak ad sales. Speculation around a possible Salesforce deal intensified Friday morning after its chief digital evangelist, Vala Afshar, tweeted several things he liked about the microblogging service. “1 personal learning network 2 the best realtime, context rich news 3 democratize intelligence 4 great place to promote others,” Afshar wrote. In a tweet an hour later, Afshar said he was simply expressing his “personal views. ” Meanwhile, Google has reportedly approached Twitter about a possible acquisition in the past, and for many analysts it remains the most logical acquirer. “Twitter would help the core Google platform become more competitive with Facebook in     news and potentially strengthen Google’s leadership position in   streaming video,” Scott Devitt, an analyst at Stifel, wrote in a Friday report. Nevertheless, Devitt recommends selling Twitter shares, citing “deteriorating fundamentals. ”   Jack Dorsey retook the helm at Twitter nearly a year ago, promising to reignite growth. Meanwhile, he has kept his job as chief executive of Square, the payments company he also founded. Dorsey’s efforts to turn around the company have been inconclusive so far, with revenue growth slowing and continued complaints that Twitter has failed to effectively crack down on abuse over the platform. In its most recent quarter, Twitter reported 313 million monthly active users  —   up just 3 percent from a year earlier. Twitter shares added $3. 99 to close at $22. 62, giving the company a market capitalization of $16 billion  —   its highest level since January. Still, that’s short of the company’s $26 IPO price in 2013."

However, the one decision that could ultimately have most impact on who wins the presidency could be whom he or she intends to nominate for treasury secretary. The next treasury chief will have the tremendous responsibility of dealing with the   financial markets and addressing our deficit in what may be a rising interest rate environment. And, of course, streamlining or jettisoning the multitudes of overzealous   regulations. The next president must also prepare for legitimate tax reform, so that corporate America can better compete around the world  —   and hardworking Americans can keep more of their paychecks. All of this must be done in the name of growth and prosperity. Make no mistake about it, this election is all about the economy. America’s has been turned into a  ’ economy, in which most workers haven’t seen a raise in more than a decade and the benefits stink. In the end, the individual chosen for the treasury job will, with the president’s direction, carry more responsibility than any treasury secretary in recent times for helping to get the American economy back in proper working order. Ordinarily, presidential candidates wait until after the election to assemble their Cabinet. In a time of war, the country would be entitled to know who a candidate intends to nominate for defense secretary. And in a time of economic outrage and hardship like today, Americans have the right to know whom a candidate intends to nominate for treasury secretary. The sooner the candidates come forth with their choices for secretary of the treasury, the better. Americans want to know who will have the best team to lead them out of this limping economy."
94561,140044,The genius of DC’s African-American museum,New York Post,F.H. Buckley,2016-12-28,2016.0,12.0,http://nypost.com/2016/12/28/the-genius-of-dcs-african-american-museum/,"Christmas is a time when Washingtonians welcome visiting friends and family, and that’s when we do the tourist stuff. The museums are wonderful, but mostly we don’t notice them. Don’t get me wrong. We love them. We just save them for the time when we play tourist guide for the   . And that’s what took me to the Smithsonian’s new   museum, when my daughter and her husband came to visit. It wouldn’t have been my first choice. I had read about how the museum made a big deal about Anita Hill and ignored Clarence Thomas, and thought that gave me a permission slip to ignore it. But then tourist guides don’t get to choose, so off we went. I’m happy I did. Whoever put it together is a genius. From the outside, the building looks small, its size limited by the Mall’s available real estate. From the inside, however, it’s huge, with not an inch wasted. The exhibits are tightly packed, and yet there’s an illusion of space. The visitor is pulled from one iconic display and one fascinating artifact to another, without ever feeling overwhelmed. The contrast with the American History Museum, across 14th Street, is striking. With twice the footprint, it has only a fraction of the exhibits, and they’re separated by a lot of empty space. Now we’ll show you this amazing thing, it says, and then over there we’ll show you another. But after all, how often do you want to see Archie Bunker’s chair, or the dresses of the first ladies? With the   museum, by contrast, there’s so much happening that after a   visit, you come away thinking you’ve only seen part of it, that you need to return if you want to get it all. There’s another big difference between the two museums. The   museum features a heavy emphasis on the civil rights revolution in the 1950s and 1960s, as you’d expect  —   but it’s not about Lyndon Johnson or the white federal judges who enforced the law at personal risk to themselves. Rather, it’s about Martin Luther King, Bayard Ruskin and Stokely Carmichael. You see Dwight Eisenhower sending federal troops to Little Rock, and some white faces among the civil rights protesters, but mostly it’s an entirely   affair. Mercifully, I didn’t see anything of Jesse Jackson. And all that seemed right to me. Even the Nation of Islam and the 1995 Million Man March. Where everything else preaches inclusiveness, what else should the   museum be but  ? And yet the museum in one respect is a failure, though a magnificent one. For even if the museum had been designed with solely   in mind, visitors from other races and cultures will come away with the feeling that you can’t understand American culture and history without appreciating how integral the   contribution is. The museum first draws you to the top floor, dedicated mostly to pop music. From Louis Armstrong to   it’s impossible to separate out black music from American music. Can you imagine American rock shorn of   influences? Actually, you can. It’s called Canadian rock. More lyrical maybe, but less rhythmic, less urgent, less American. And less popular. The floor below is largely devoted to sports, and it’s the same thing all over again, from Jackie Robinson and Muhammad Ali to Tiger Woods and the latest Olympic athletes. It can blow you away, which may explain why the biggest crowds gather round to see a video of the Harlem Globetrotters. Leaving the singers, the sports celebrities, the novelists and poets, the visitor descends on a huge elevator to the underground levels where the story begins the third floor down with the arrival of African slaves. From there one ascends to the Revolutionary War, where blacks fought on both sides, some seeking their freedom by joining loyalist forces, and from there to the slave revolts, the Underground Railroad, the Civil War and finally the civil rights movement. It’s not about you if you’re not black, and yet it is about you if you’re an American. It’s about a history, an experience that is unequivocally American, that is American to its core. That’s why all Americans should see it. Maybe next time if they visit us for the inauguration."

The $52 million deal to   which City Hall awarded to a de Blasio pal who offered less money for the   land than two other bidders, has attracted the attention of federal and city prosecutors, The Post has learned. The joint probe comes three months after   and marks the seventh    scandal engulfing the de Blasio administration. Mayor de Blasio’s latest imbroglio has investigators questioning why the city chose Hudson Cos. to buy the Brooklyn Public Library branch on Clinton Street and build a   condo on top of it despite submitting a bid that was $6 million less than a competitor’s. The offices of US Attorney Preet Bharara and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance sent subpoenas to several of the 14 developers that bid on the project, sources familiar with the investigation said. One of the subpoenas went to Toll Brothers City Living New York President David Von Spreckelsen, a source said. Toll Brothers offered $1 million more than Hudson, the sources said. Hudson President David Kramer is “one of many people being looked at” but has not been subpoenaed, the sources said. Federal and city prosecutors, and Von Spreckelsen and Kramer all declined to comment. Hoping to raise money to refurbish its system, the Brooklyn Public Library approached the city to draw up a request for proposals for the development of the site. The city and library jointly released the RFP in June 2013. The city Economic Development Corp. vetted the bids on behalf of the library. Kramer proposed a   residential skyscraper  —   with 114 units of affordable housing sited two miles away. The plan included space for the library on the ground floor and $40 million of the $52 million bid to spruce up other branches. He also planned to relocate the library to a space on Remsen Street in July 2016 for the   construction period. At least two competing developers not only offered to pay the library more money, but several proposed to build affordable units on the site.   Second Development Services offered the library $6 million more than did Hudson and 117 affordable units. One competing bidder described the process as rigged to benefit de Blasio’s friends. “It’s going to be hard to explain to a federal prosecutor why Toll Brothers, a large firm, was outbid by a smaller bidder,” the source said. Kramer not only lavished cash into the mayor’s campaign coffers, he pressed his case in meetings with Deputy Mayor Alicia Glenn in early 2014. “Kramer was telling people at the time, ‘Whatever we need to do, we’re going to win this,’ ” said one   source familiar with the bid process. A friend of the mayor for more than a decade, Kramer and his wife have given $9, 125 to de Blasio’s political campaigns since 2007. De Blasio has refunded $6, 325 of that money without giving an explanation on city campaign filings. De Blasio kept another $4, 850 that came from Hudson employees, records show. Kramer and his project architect, Jonathan Marvel, also hosted   for de Blasio’s mayoral campaign, including an October 2013 soirée for which Marvel invited the city’s biggest developers. Six weeks after de Blasio was sworn in, Hudson coughed up $5, 000 to the Campaign for One New York, a charity promoting the mayor’s agenda. Marvel Architects added $2, 000 in June 2015. Toll Brothers also has given CONY two $25, 000 donations. The city picked Hudson and Toll Brothers as the two finalists in the summer of 2014 before choosing Hudson in September of that year. Demolition and construction is slated to begin this fall. A de Blasio spokesman said the RFP process for the library “followed a strict protocol” and that Hudson Companies won the contract “meritoriously, as its bid provided the best overall package for the library . . . including the most affordable housing. ”"

Just five days after The Boss played his   gig on American soil with an astonishing     performance at MetLife Stadium, Springsteen came back on Tuesday night to go one better (or two, for those who were counting). The final night of a   stand in East Rutherford ended at 12:12 a. m. after 4 hours and 1 minute. The only recorded Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band show that went for longer was one in Helsinki, Finland, in 2012 (4 hours and 6 minutes). It was a special night for fans from the very start, as the E Street Band indulged their   followers with 80 minutes worth of music taken almost exclusively from their   first two albums, “Greetings From Asbury Park, N. J. ” and “The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle” (both released in 1973, two years before “Born to Run” shot them to fame). The only exceptions were a stirring version of Eddie Cochran’s “Summertime Blues” and the Manfred Mann cover “Pretty Flamingo. ” Been to over 300   shows since 1980, and tonight may have been the best.  4:01 hours a new U. S. record.   —   Gary Green (@ChasersOwner)  This tour (which began in January) was intended to promote the deluxe reissue of 1980’s “The River. ” On early dates, the band played the entire double album from start to finish. But now,    Springsteen is culling just a handful of those tracks, choosing instead to duck and dive around his history by dropping in a   version of “Atlantic City,” “Because the Night” (made famous by Patti Smith) and a clutch of selections from 1984’s blockbuster “Born in the U. S. A. ” By the encore, the strains were showing, particularly in “Glory Days,” when Springsteen’s voice appeared to crack. “I really am getting pretty tired,” he laughed, as both he and guitarist Steve Van Zandt went through a   routine, complete with a James   cape. But the band powered through to set the new   record with a finale of Tom Waits’ “Jersey Girl. ” It was a show for the ages, and the only thing Springsteen and the E Street Band didn’t do was serve breakfast. Maybe they’ll wait to break five hours before busting out the bacon and eggs. Even after more than 40 years, there still seems to be no limit to their onstage possibilities."

Roth, 44, who wrote, directed and produced the horror flicks “Cabin Fever,” “Hostel” and “Hostel: Part II”  —   and acted in “Inglorious Basterds”  —   returns to host “Shark After Dark,” airing Sunday through Thursday ( :30 p. m.) following  . The aftershow features celebrity guests, shark fans and shark experts talking about, well, sharks. Roth spoke to The Post about diving with tiger sharks and why he feels sharks are the ocean’s most misunderstood creatures. Let’s think about that. How else are we getting information about sharks? We only know sharks from movies like “Jaws” or when a shark bites someone. Otherwise, the only way you’ll ever get to know a shark is to get in the water with it  —   and most of the population is not going to do that. When I took people [shark] diving the change in them was literally instantaneous  —   the second you’re in the water and look [a shark] in the eye, there’s no interest on their part; they’re peaceful, curious animals who are highly intelligent and very shy. It’s not like what you see in the news or in movies. They’re peaceful, curious animals who are highly intelligent and very shy. It’s not like what you see in the news or in movies. So few people have had an experience with a shark. Yes, there are cases where [shark bites] happen, but only six people die, worldwide, each year and there are 100 million sharks killed each year [for their fins, considered a delicacy in some parts of the world]. Sharks are incredibly endangered; their function is to keep the ocean clean of disease and they only eat sick or diseased fish. People survive shark bites because the shark truly doesn’t want to eat them. They don’t have hands  —   they investigate with their teeth. Shark attacks are often near a pier where people are fishing or someone is chumming the water and trying to catch a fish [and] the shark thinks it’s   …     taking a bite of a fish. I love sharks and I’ve always been fascinated by them. I feel like I’m the “Shark Whisperer,” and they like me. When I’m scratching one on its nose or holding one in my hand, they’re really gentle, sweet creatures, beautiful and fascinating. We don’t matter to them when we’re down there [in the ocean]. I went diving with tiger sharks in Tahiti and didn’t know what to expect. They’re wild animals. But a tiger shark showed up and this girl [shark] just circles us. She could’ve bitten me in half if she wanted to but she was cautiously investigating. I’d never been close to anything that size  —   it was like being next to a dinosaur. Yeah, of course. They’re one of the last creatures on Earth than can eat us. Sharks represent a loss of control in the water and   …     I think that’s what makes it fun for horror movies. I’ve talked to shark experts and I’m like, “Am I crazy or are these far more like dogs than anybody realizes?” Nobody knows that sharks are endangered: 200, 000 sharks a day have their fins sliced off   …     and I’ve been told that the makeup industry uses shark liver in its products. There are a lot of underground fishing boats where they slice off the [shark] fins and throw the creatures back in  —   it’s sickening. The way a shark moves is with water flowing through its gills for propulsion. It has to be moving to breathe; if it stops moving it dies. Slicing off its fins is incredibly painful and it bleeds out and drowns."
96871,143133,Redstone unleashes vile rant at ex-girlfriend,New York Post,Helen Kumari and Claire Atkinson,2016-05-06,2016.0,5.0,http://nypost.com/2016/05/06/sumner-redstone-calls-his-ex-girlfriend-a-f-ing-b-ch/,"Sumner Redstone repeatedly called his   a “    bitch” in a legal deposition while accusing her of plundering $40 million, a Los Angeles court heard Friday. The    controlling shareholder of CBS and Viacom  —   once a proud titan of the media industry and now the subject of dementia allegations  —   is trying to rid himself of an Argentine beauty who lived in his house and was his main caretaker. Manuela Herzer, 51, wants to be reinstated as Redstone’s   agent  —   a position that would conceivably give her a huge amount of power over the future of his $43 billion media empire.  Judge David Cowan said he would weigh Herzer’s claims over the weekend and could rule as early as Monday against her. Redstone, meanwhile, wants to claw back some $150 million in gifts given to Herzer and another former girlfriend, Sydney Holland, according to his lawyers. That suit is yet to be filed. In a videotaped deposition played behind closed doors Friday, with a transcript made available to the media, Redstone struggles with his dentures while repeatedly trashing the woman he admits he once loved. Asked by her lawyer, Pierce O’Donnell, “Who is Manuela Herzer?” Redstone responds, “She is  —   Manuela is a     bitch. ” Questioned over why she was forced out of his Beverly Park mansion, he says, “I kicked her out,” adding, “Manuela is a     bitch. ” Asked when a photo of him and Herzer was taken, Redstone says, “Who cares?” O’Donnell asks, “Did Manuela steal money from you?” He responds, “Yes. ” When O’Donnell asks why Redstone didn’t explain his reasoning, he says, “Because she’s a     bitch. ” In the deposition, Redstone is asked by his own lawyer, Gabrielle Vidal, “Who do you want to make your   decisions?” He responds, “Shar  —   Shari,” referring to his daughter, Shari. Shari Redstone had reached a preliminary agreement to take over those duties just weeks ago, but a settlement with Herzer broke down. After Herzer was booted from Redstone’s home in October 2015, Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman was appointed as Redstone’s main   agent, a move that raised eyebrows with the judge, who questioned how effective Dauman could be, given he lives in New York. It also is an apparent conflict of interest since Dauman is CEO and could exert influence on Redstone, the majority shareholder. The interview showed Redstone is able to articulate himself by pointing to letters of words he is trying to say. He was unable to respond to a question about his birth name. The stunning deposition is the first glimpse anyone has had of Redstone since his last public earnings call in November 2014, when he appeared to be cut off briefly after only a few words. The backdrop to the weeklong trial involves the future of Viacom, which houses MTV, Comedy Central and Paramount, and CBS Corp. home of the CBS network and Showtime. Until February Redstone was the highly paid executive chairman of both Viacom and CBS. Now he controls the two companies via the   National Amusements. He holds 80 percent of National Amusements, while his daughter owns the balance. In turn, National Amusements owns 80 percent of both CBS and Viacom. If Redstone is deemed incapacitated, a   trust may kick in and take over the assets. Shari is believed to have votes to decide how things play out across the two big corporations.  The court also heard from a psychiatrist hired by Herzer, Dr. Stephen Read, who described Redstone as suffering from “mild to severe dementia. ” Read told the court Redstone “has impaired   and   memory that is between mild and severe, but towards severe. ”  He is unable to identify different colors, the doctor said. Lawyers for the mogul argued in early filings that Redstone retains capacity.  Read also testified that Redstone’s family plays him recorded sports events and makes sure the mogul’s bets always pay off even though he can’t identify the teams. The doctor also told the courtroom that Redstone can’t complete the “most crucial and executive functions,” such as understanding problems and the ability to process information and change plans. Oddly, Redstone’s granddaughter, Keryn, testified Friday in support of Herzer, who became Redstone’s main caretaker after prior girlfriend Holland was booted from Redstone’s Beverly Park mansion for having an affair. Judge Cowan said it’s possible the trial may not continue Monday. He is set to consider both sides over the weekend. After hearing from Redstone that he wants his daughter to take on his   duties, Cowan said, “How can I sit here after listening to that video and say you can’t have what you want?”  "

Terrorist brothers Salem and Nawaf Alhazmi came “running in the front door looking around and didn’t know which way to go” and were about to miss their flight when Vaughn Allex stepped in to help get them checked in and onto the doomed plane, Allex said in a recent interview. The jet was soon hijacked by the men and crashed into the Pentagon, killing 189. Allex didn’t realize what he’d done until a day after the crash and FBI agents asked to interview him. “I looked at the FBI agents, and they looked at me, and they knew, and I just went, ‘I did it, didn’t I?’ ” Allex recalled to   affiliate   in Virginia. “They said, ‘You did what?’ I said, ‘I did it, I put them on the plane.’ “Hardly a day goes by when there’s not some kind of reminder,” he told the station. “It was pretty bad, it was pretty much a bottomless pit for a long time. ” Despite assertions by the FBI and FAA that he’d done nothing wrong, Allex felt crushed by his own guilt and had nowhere to turn but to family. He was ostracized by his colleagues, and support groups were no help, he told NPR’s  . “How do I sit in a room with people that are, that are mourning and crying and they’re like, ‘What’s your role in this whole thing? ’” he mused. What could he say to them? “‘Well, I checked in a couple of the hijackers and made sure they got on the flight. ’” Allex was so haunted by guilt that when a customer mentioned her husband had been killed in the   attacks, the airline worker said it was as if he heard, “You killed my husband on September 11. ” The tormented man left American Airlines for a job with the Department of Homeland Security in 2008, and is finally beginning to heal. He visits the national   Pentagon memorial throughout the year, and attends annual commemorative events, such as Rattle the Runway Ride at Dulles Airport  —   where motorbike enthusiasts remember those who died. “I feel like in some ways I’ve  —   I really have come out of a shadow over the last 15 years,” Allex told NPR. “And I’m  —   I’m back in the light now. ”"
97903,144583,Real estate tycoons’ Top 7 fall projects,New York Post,Steve Cuozzo,2016-09-05,2016.0,9.0,http://nypost.com/2016/09/05/real-estate-tycoons-top-7-fall-projects/,"With Labor Day behind us, school’s in for the city’s real estate power players.  Here’s our selective guide to the   big deals on their agendas.  A comprehensive, complex proposal to allow larger and taller towers in Manhattan’s historic commercial heart was finally set in motion by the Department of City Planning after two years of study and input. Now it must survive the ULURP review process, which requires approval by the City Council and the mayor. No mere technicality, it’s key to saving from obsolescence the   district  —   where buildings are an average of 50 years old. And zoning rules written mostly in 1961 have made new construction nearly impossible.  The SL Green giant next to Grand Central Terminal has signed only one tenant so far, TD Bank, for 200, 000 square feet. The roughly    tower has a total of 1. 6 million square feet. Other   were likely wary of Andrew Penson’s   rights lawsuit over the project. Although demolition of old structures is nearly complete, the possibility of delay had dogged the project. Now that the suit’s resolved and construction is under way, watch for more leases to be signed.  These will test the Midtown and Downtown markets for    —   but far from new  —   offices. They must compete both with   space coming online elsewhere in Manhattan, as well as with other older Midtown towers undergoing   upgrades as longtime tenants move out.   28 Liberty, a   landmark that was formerly Chase Plaza, has 1 million square feet of its total 2. 2 million up for grabs via JLL. The former Sony tower at 550 Madison, opened in 1984, is completely vacant. The new owner, Saudi   Olayan America, has tapped CBRE to find users for its 850, 000 square feet.  It might be too much to expect that Larry Silverstein will score a tenant so soon after a decision by 21st Century Fox and News Corp. not to proceed with a nonbinding letter of intent. But don’t think he won’t try. Silverstein, 85, would love to build the WTC’s final planned tower to complete his legacy.  Related Cos. later this month will unveil a monumental, $200 million sculpture by Britain’s Thomas Heatherwick to be the focal point of the vast public plaza at Hudson Yards, which is to include Neiman Marcus and a selection of restaurants curated by Thomas Keller. Related CEO Stephen Ross says the   work of art will “become to New York what the Eiffel Tower is to Paris, I believe. ”  Douglas Durst’s company is in talks to buy a large development site at 1800 Park Ave. at 125th Street from Bruce Eichner, who dug a foundation but wasn’t able to put up a planned apartment project. The challenging corner is across the street from the Harlem Metro North station and a block west of a troubled drug clinic. But a Durst purchase would likely be a   for East Harlem, which needs the stability and marketing savvy that only one of the city’s most successful developers can provide.  The MTA’s $4. 5 billion project to extend the Q line to East 96th Street might or might not meet its December opening deadline. Auditors say it won’t make the target despite MTA promises that it will. But even if the new line turns out to be a few months late, it’s no big deal after 100 years of waiting. The line, with stations at East 63rd, 72nd, 86th and 96th streets, is a huge transit boost for Upper East Siders, especially those who work in Midtown and Downtown."

Hope Stringer, a    energy broker from Billericay, Essex, knew something was wrong when her left temple was throbbing and she was still feeling hung over a week after she went out drinking with her gal pals. “I was tired for days after, but I thought it was just a hangover. The older I’m getting, the worse they seem,” she told Caters News Agency. Her symptoms worsened over the next few months, prompting her to schedule an appointment with her general practitioner. “I was told it was just a migraine and was prescribed painkillers, which didn’t seem unusual as I’d been working long hours at my job where I’m constantly on the phone and on the computer,” she said. “I know my body and I knew something wasn’t right,” Stringer added. And when the pain just wouldn’t go away, she finally got an MRI that revealed she had   sarcoma at just 23 years old. “I’d been completely healthy up until that point and couldn’t believe that what I originally thought was a hangover could be something so serious,” she said. Doctors removed a cancerous tumor from Stringer’s neck and then she endured six rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. “I think I dealt with the news that I had cancer extremely well. I told my family the rules: There was to be no sadness or tears. I just wanted to remain positive and focus on getting better,” she told Caters. She even had a shaving party to get rid of her hair once it started falling out from the chemo treatments. But her fight wasn’t over, as doctors found another tumor that forced them to remove a nerve in her throat in hopes of eradicating the deadly disease. “When doctors told me they’d have to remove a vocal cord nerve as well, which would affect my speech, I didn’t care at that stage,” she said. “I just wanted the cancer gone. ” And now that she is   Stringer is trying to educate people about the disease that nearly killed her. “I want other people to be aware of the signs and symptoms and take action as soon as possible,” she said. “If I hadn’t kept going back to the doctors, the outcome may be very different today. ”"

Austin Harrouff had a trace of amount of marijuana in his system when he allegedly killed John Stevens, 59, and his    wife, Michelle Mishcon, outside their   home Aug. 15, according to the report. Martin County Sheriff William Snyder had previously speculated that Harrouff may have been on flakka or bath salts, but those drugs were not detected. Harrouff, 19, was   after the killings for a burned esophagus, possibly from ingesting chemicals found in the couple’s garage. Nellie King, Harrouff’s attorney, said in a statement Wednesday that her client is mentally ill. “The judicial process will bear all of this out in due time,” King said. Prosecutors declined comment. Harrouff has pleaded not guilty to   murder and other charges. He could face the death penalty if convicted. Deputies had said that when they arrived at the couple’s home, they found the   former high school football player and wrestler in his underwear, making animal noises and biting Stevens’ face as he pinned his victim’s body to the driveway. According to court documents, one deputy ordered Harrouff off Stevens at gunpoint while another used an electric stun gun on him but he wouldn’t let go. Snyder has said the deputies didn’t shoot Harrouff because they feared hitting Stevens. Finally, a deputy with a dog arrived and its bites enabled deputies to subdue Harrouff. Mishcon’s body was found in the garage. Harrouff, who had no previous arrest record,   “Help me, I ate something bad” and then admitted it was “humans” as he spit out a piece of flesh, court documents show. He begged deputies to kill him after they pulled him off Stevens’ body, according to the records. “Shoot me now, I deserve to die,” Harrouff said. Less than an hour before the attack, Harrouff was having dinner with his father, sister and a friend at a restaurant about 4 miles from the victims’ house when he apparently had words with his father. Surveillance video shows him calmly walking out about 45 minutes before the stabbings, and his family was concerned. His mother, unaware of the attack, called police to report him missing; she said he had been acting strangely for about a week, claiming to have superpowers and to have been sent here to help people. The victims lived a short distance from Harrouff’s father and were known to sit in their garage with the door open, watching television and chatting with  . Harrouff’s parents issued a statement days after the slayings expressing their condolences to the Stevens family and apologies to neighbor Jeff Fisher, who was stabbed as he tried to rescue the couple."
99399,146606,Kiefer Sutherland review – trading his Glock for a guitar for a show of grizzled authenticity,Guardian,Mark Beaumont,2017-06-23,2017.0,6.0,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/23/kiefer-sutherland-review-islington-assembly-room-london,"Jack Bauer swaps     assassination thwarting for country music? Excuse us if we don’t yeehaw to the rooftops. Russell Crowe, Keanu Reeves, Kevin Bacon, Bruce Willis and Johnny Depp have collectively set the bar for   Hollywood hobby albums ridiculously low  —   they’re the musical equivalent of comedians knocking out godawful novels. At least Kiefer Sutherland, touring his debut country album, Down in a Hole, has a legitimate grounding in his chosen genre. Turned on to country and western as a rancher and competitive lassoer in the 90s, the boy sure can rope a goddanged steer. His immersion is pure method, too  —   he arrives wearing a   hat and skewiff neckerchief, looking like the Lone Ranger after a lifetime of bad choices, sipping whiskey and dropping “y’alls” like no   Canadian movie star really should. He turns his grizzled,   baritone to authentic songs of   romance and hard drinking I’ll Do Anything is a dreamy vision of finding unexpected love close to home( stead) while the drowsy,   waltz Not Enough Whiskey and Going Home, a   country noir about passing out drunk in a Tokyo gutter at 4am, have him falling into the arms of Jack Daniels when it all goes wrong. When he namedrops Johnny Cash, it isn’t facile  . Sutherland proves himself a skilful southern gothic storyteller on Shirley Jean, a convict spiritual that lends a sympathetic lilt to the tale of a young   inmate writing a letter to his lover on the eve of his execution, and his impressive band kick up a tribute cover of Merle Haggard’s   The Bottle Let Me Down so vigorous you can smell the sawdust and shotgun grease. As Kiefer spins yarns of boozy nights and childhood escapades  —   notably, the night his father, Donald, reeled in drunk with his trousers torn and, unable to mend them, “painted his ass black with boot polish”  —   it’s clear that country is the gentle blade that cuts closest to the dark dramas at his heart. That much is evident in Truth in Your Eyes, a devastating ode to an unnamed lover lost too young, and how the ovation that greets   ballad Calling Out Your Name, about his first heartbreak, brings genuine tears to his eyes. Add dashes of modern trucker rock on the new track Rebel Wind and Mark   doomy country on All She Wrote  —   all hangman guitars and Satan taking a turn on bass  —   and you have the first Hollywood hobby act unshackled by convention and with a real shot at greatness. Dammit."
99661,146936,Trump’s first week was a crusade against everything. But we returned the favor,Guardian,Rebecca Solnit,2017-01-27,2017.0,1.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/27/donald-trump-first-week-in-office-resistance,"On 2 January 2016, Ammon Bundy and a group of armed militants seized the headquarters of a remote wildlife refuge outpost in   Oregon. On 20 January 2017, Donald Trump and an unarmed band of extremists seized (through an election, it’s true, but one in which Trump lost the popular vote by a wide margin) the White House, and their first week in power has seemed as bellicose and extreme. Or more so really, since the scope is so much larger. As the journalist Jonathan Katz quipped: “First they came for the Latinos, Muslims, women, gays, poor people, intellectuals and scientists and then it was Wednesday. ” They seem to have launched a crusade against almost everything and everyone. We’ve returned the favor. Saturday’s women’s march was probably the biggest protest in American history. It included small demonstrations from Homer, Alaska, to Abeline, Texas, as well as huge ones from Los Angeles to Washington  and it gave rise to the remark that “Donald Trump just set the world record for the guy rejected by more women in a single day in the history of humanity”. The new administration launched a war against reproductive rights internationally by reinstating the   global gag order (there is a lot of gagging going on this week) and against funding all of the 25 programs managed by the Department of Justice’s office on violence against women.  They also immediately launched a war against truth, facts, science and transparency, especially as they relate to climate change. In response, scientists  —  who climate activists have been trying to prod into taking political stands for decades, and who mostly haven’t  —   are now organizing a march of their own. Employees at the EPA, the National Park Service, Nasa, and other traditionally neutral branches of government appear to be scared, furious, and ready to fight back, whether it’s continuing to share climate information or speaking out.  After the park service was told to shut up for tweeting information on the comparatively small size of the inauguration crowd, Badlands national park kept sending out climate information, and then a handful of independent voices began speaking up on Twitter, including @AltUSNatParkService, which said on 24 January: “Mr Trump, you may have taken us down officially. But with scientific evidence  the internet our message will get out. ” It will take more than tweets, but the tweets show some very encouraging defiance. We are under attack, but we are beautifully insubordinate.  Government employees in many branches are disgruntled or departed. Reports vary on whether the key senior staff at the state department quit or resigned, but they’re gone. Former CIA employees and    current employees report being disgusted and insulted by Trump’s rambling,   speech at CIA headquarters the day after his inauguration. Former CIA deputy director Philip Mudd said on CNN, “It feels like we’re on Mr Toad’s Wild Ride here. ” Mr Toad was notable for his vanity and his tendency to drive his motorcar into the ditch. Trump’s offhand remark during his CIA visit, that we should have taken Iraq’s oil, is sure to stir up alarm and resentment in the Middle East. Meanwhile, his remarks about the border wall were so inflammatory that Mexico’s current president, Enrique Peña Nieto, cancelled his visit to Washington, former president Vicente Fox tweeted a series of attacks on Trump, and the National Review warned that stirring up fury in Mexico could help bring a leftist to power there. China is rattling whatever the modern equivalent of sabers is. The new administration is building disasters as fast as they can, and what comes crashing down may crash down on them. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a lawsuit against Trump on Monday morning, alleging that he’s in violation of the emoluments clause of the constitution, charges that could lay the groundwork for impeachment.  The word resistance is everywhere. Former labor secretary Robert Reich gives a daily address on Facebook Live called the Resistance Report. The group 18millionrising. org, which represents Asian and Pacific islanders in the US, has launched a “100 Days of Resistance” campaign. The Working Families party reports that on Tuesday more than 10, 000 people went to congressional offices to protest against Trump. Climate and human rights groups launched Unstoppabletogether. org to link human rights, racial and environmental justice. Greenpeace hung a gigantic banner off a crane next to the White House: it said “Resist”. Organizers tell me that hordes of people who have never been active before are looking for ways to plug in. People whose immigration status, religion or healthcare needs mean they may be directly threatened are terrified, and in many cases mobilized. Of course the Trump administration has also attacked the media strategist Steve Bannon declared in an interview published on Thursday: “The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut. ” The media has finally gotten bold about calling lies lies: the Denver Post even ran an editorial titled, “Lying Donald Trump Can’t Be Trusted”. Even the Nixon administration took long, bitter years to get to this point. All this stirring and discord and messaging and organizing guarantees nothing, but as an indicator of popular will and institutional opposition, it’s impressive. Dislodging Trump may be one lawsuit or scandal or investigation or mental health meltdown away. Or it may take years of broadly coordinated grassroots effort, or it may come down to the next presidential election. Either way, it’s an unprecedented beginning, one that feels like a civil war, but a civil war in which a lot of civil society is already passionately engaged against the government  —   or what remains of a government that has turned its own employees across many departments against it. We’ve never seen anything like it. It destabilizes almost everything, and that’s both horrific and full of possibility."
100454,147958,Trump meets with intelligence leaders after calling Russia case ’witch-hunt’,Guardian,Spencer Ackerman,2017-01-06,2017.0,1.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/06/donald-trump-russia-hacking-meeting-intelligence-officials,"Donald Trump struck a conciliatory tone with US intelligence officials after meeting with their leadership, but did not publicly support their conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 US presidential contest. In a statement issued ahead of the release of a declassified version of the intelligence assessment, Trump said he had “tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of this community” describing his meeting with James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, and other senior intelligence officials, as “constructive”. His comments came after an extraordinary public feud between Trump and leaders of the intelligence apparatus he will soon control. However, Trump discussed the hack and leak of embarrassing Democratic National Committee data in generic terms, suggesting he had not moved away from his earlier statements casting attribution for the data breach as unknowable. “Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations,” Trump said in a Friday afternoon statement, and underlined “there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines”. In a statement issued after the New York meeting, Trump pledged to task his administration with creating a   plan to “combat and stop cyberattacks”. Trump and his deputies have treated discussion of potential foreign interference in a US election as an effort merely to delegitimize his presidency before it begins.  In an interview with the New York Times hours before the meeting, the   derided the concentration on Moscow as a “political  ” by bitter political opponents. “They got beaten very badly in the election,” he said. The interview emerged just as Clapper, CIA director John Brennan and FBI director James Comey arrived at Trump Tower to present detailed findings and likely motives for Moscow’s alleged interference. Barack Obama was given the same briefing on Thursday, while senior Democrats and Republicans in Washington received it on Friday morning. Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, said the intelligence report was “quite a stunning disclosure” and parts would be made public later on Friday. US intelligence officials told the Washington Post and broadcaster NBC that the classified document, said to be more than 50 pages long, says intercepted communications revealed senior Russian intelligence officials celebrating Trump’s win. Trump called for lawmakers to investigate the leak to the media. “I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it,” he tweeted on Friday. Asked about Trump’s tweet, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, noted that Trump had earlier this week made a “steadfast defence” of Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, suggesting that this raised questions over his true motives. The   had cited a denial by Assange that his source for Democratic party emails released during the election was the Russian government or “a state party”. Trump argued in a phone interview with the New York Times on Friday that China had, “relatively recently, hacked 20 million government names . .. how come nobody even talks about that? This is a political  . ” The   also cited reports this week that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) had refused to give the FBI access to its computer servers after it was hacked. “The DNC wouldn’t let them see the servers,” Trump told the paper. “How can you be sure about hacking when you can’t even get to the servers?” The DNC has previously claimed that the FBI did not ask to examine the servers themselves. The unprecedented dispute broke into the open at a congressional hearing on Thursday as the head of US intelligence publicly defended his analysts, who he said “stand more resolutely” than ever behind their conclusion of “Russian interference in our electoral process”. Clapper told the Senate armed services committee that there was a “difference between scepticism and disparagement”. Clapper and Adm Michael Rogers, the director of the NSA, expressed concerns about intelligence analysts’ morale after Trump’s perceived disparagement of their work, with Rogers suggesting some may quit. Clapper said Russia “has clearly assumed an even more aggressive cyber posture” and described the assault on the 2016 election as “multifaceted”. “Hacking was only one part of it,” he said. “It also entailed classical propaganda, disinformation and fake news. ” Clapper, who has in the past signalled his discomfort with public intelligence testimony  —   and who has apologised for previous false statements to the Senate on the scope of domestic NSA surveillance  —   said he intended to “push the envelope as much as I can on the unclassified version” of the report “because I think the public should know as much of this as possible”. The US   Joe Biden, also weighed in. He said it would be legitimate to question intelligence and ask for more detail or disagree but “dangerous” to publicly criticise the agencies and claim to know more than them. “For a president not to have confidence in, not to be prepared to listen to, the myriad intelligence agencies, from defence intelligence to the CIA, is absolutely mindless,” he said in an interview with PBS. “The idea that you may know more than the intelligence community knows  —   it’s like saying I know more about physics than my professor. I didn’t read the book, I just know I know more. ” Several advisers due to join Trump and   elect Mike Pence for Friday’s intelligence briefing included incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn incoming deputy national security adviser K T McFarland Thomas Bossert, Trump’s pick for homeland security adviser and representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, Trump’s choice to head the CIA. Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, insisted that Trump would go into Friday’s meeting “prepared to listen and understand how they got to the conclusions”. Asked on ABC’s Good Morning America if Trump would have an open mind, Spicer replied: “100%. ” He added: “The   I think, has a healthy scepticism on everything. ” He added that “a rush to judgment is not in the country’s best interest”. The Trump transition team has sought to weaken the impact of the intelligence findings on Russia meddling in the election by highlighting the US intelligence community’s failures over Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion. Clapper claimed that US intelligence collection and analysis had vastly improved since then. “We do make mistakes, but we try to learn from them and make changes,” he said, insisting that the contrast between US intelligence then and now was “the difference of night and day”. Amid the background of distrust is a plan Trump is reportedly considering to reorganise the US intelligence apparatus. According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the proposal, Trump is considering diminishing the role of the director of national intelligence and returning the CIA directorship, under Trump’s pick, Mike Pompeo, to its prime role within the intelligence community. Trump’s incoming press secretary Sean Spicer called the report “100% false”. Since Trump’s election, some career US intelligence officials have told the Guardian they fear retaliation for their assessment of Russian electoral interference. Clapper, who resigned in November and will leave his post when Trump is inaugurated, said the current intelligence leadership had not been consulted any reorganisation plan.  Also on Friday, before his meeting with intelligence bosses, Trump met with editors of Condé Nast, whose titles include Vogue, the New Yorker, and Vanity Fair. He tweeted to say he had been asked to meet with them by Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor, who backed Hillary Clinton during the election. "
101312,149067,The Guardian view on Bernie Sanders: a voice worth hearing,Guardian,Editorial,2017-03-10,2017.0,3.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/10/the-guardian-view-on-bernie-sanders-a-voice-worth-hearing,"If the Democratic party is to offer hope, grit and stamina for the battle ahead with Donald Trump, it needs leadership. In his Guardian interview Bernie Sanders, the   senator from Vermont, makes a strong claim to provide that to a party that is in its worst state since the 1920s. The stakes could not be higher. The senator rightly calls out the US president for attempting to destroy the credibility of the American political system  —   using lies so that he can run it unchallenged as well as unhindered by the moral obligation to exercise power in an informed way. Mr Trump seeks authoritarian control of republican government and is exploiting the Republican establishment’s desire for power and the Democratic party’s disarray. Not only do the Republicans control both chambers of Congress but the Democrats today have just 16 governorships  —   almost half what they had in 2008. If there is no change by 2020, when states next redraw their legislative and congressional districts on the basis of a US census, Republicans could gerrymander to ensure Trumpism dominates US politics. Hence it is good to see Mr Sanders call for Republicans to join hands in opposing Mr Trump. It’s not just Republicans who must change. The US senator is clear that the Democrats should become a   party again and reconnect liberals with the concerns of ordinary working Americans. This means the party has to consider how to prevent wages from sinking and prevent jobs from being exported. It needs to make the case to   workers, who are frightened of being downsized themselves, that paying taxes to provide benefits for all is a necessary act for social stability. It will require a political project that flattens America’s dizzying inequalities and stops the secession of the successful. Democrats should question why globalisation is producing a world economy in which an attempt by a nation to prevent the immiseration of its workers may result only in depriving them of employment. What Mr Sanders is saying is that Democrats should face the unpleasant truths about themselves, but not take those truths as the last word about America’s chances for happiness. The Democratic party must have more agency and less spectatorship. Democrats made America more than just an economic and military giant. They showed the world their nation was also a force for good. Mr Sanders is helping us to remember that."
101363,149133,No president cares more about size – so let’s show Trump how many of us oppose him,Guardian,Hadley Freeman,2017-01-28,2017.0,1.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/28/president-trump-cares-size-how-many-oppose,"I’ll say this about the Trump presidency: it certainly has a clarifying effect. It has, for a start, clarified who the most shamelessly awful people in British public life are, as Trump’s defenders rise like floaters, desperately chasing a cosy ambassadorship or at least a follow on Twitter. Nigel Farage, Arron Banks, Michael Gove, media figures who once had a certain clout but now gain validation only from social media and so should never be mentioned by anyone again all eagerly posing for photos with their alpha papa and dutifully describing his every   stumble as a graceful pirouette, a litter of Squealers to Trump’s Napoleon (the Animal Farm references come so readily these days). The president’s supporters insist the haters just don’t understand him, not the way they, his BFFs, do. OK, sure, he repeatedly bellowed “America first” in his inauguration speech, but, as Michael Gove explained to Robert Peston last Sunday, the rest of us are looking at Trump “with, I believe, an insufficient degree of context”. (The context in this particular instance being that the America First Committee was an isolationist pressure group fronted by the notorious antisemite, Charles Lindbergh the   League has repeatedly asked Trump to stop using this toxic and loaded phrase to no avail. How’s that for background, Michael?) After all, these men say, he’s always been  —   and I quote one of them  —   “a good loyal friend”. It’s been a while since I read Dante, but I’m pretty sure the centre of hell was described as a place where wealthy, straight, white men fart on about how Trump was nice to them, so why would anyone moan? But every action must have an equal and opposite reaction, and so while some people are sinking to the absolute bottom, I see many more rising to the creamy top. The Trump presidency has motivated millions to take action, even people like me who can barely be bothered to leave the house most days. My WhatsApp groups, most of which were set up to share comedy headlines from Goop, have become improbable places of insurgency. One group of university friends joined the campaign Bridges Not Walls and held a banner reading “Migration is older than language” across Westminster Bridge in London, while a friend in New York draped a similar one from the Queensboro Bridge both made the international news. Another group is holding fundraisers for women’s and refugee shelters. Because there comes a point when you have to choose between endorsing a crooked and bigoted regime or fighting back there is no in between, and that point is now. Last weekend, while Trump was lying to the CIA, I marched in London, just as my mother did in Paris, and my American friends did in New York, Washington DC and Los Angeles. Millions of women around the world were united by a determination to show that they would not silently accept a man who threatens their rights, who mocks menstruation and grabs vaginas. Hilariously, some people, even those on the left, mocked the protest, or at least questioned whether it was “democratic”  —   as though the freedom to protest wasn’t the absolute essence of democracy. “It’s precisely this sort of stuff [a women’s march] that lead to Donald Trump,” one leftish journalist tweeted. It always is a woman’s fault, isn’t it? Come on, ladies, stop alienating men by protesting against misogyny! A common criticism was that the march lacked specificity. We need to target issues, not waste time shouting about watery generalisations, these critics say. Well, women are multitaskers and I’ll show you an entire gender that can do both. After all, no president has ever cared more than Trump about size and numbers. So fight specific issues, by all means  —   but let’s also show him how many of us are in it together. Similarly, Labour MP Richard Burgon tweeted, “Trump’s inauguration is what happens when   parties abandon transformation of economic system and rely on identity politics”. During the campaign, Hillary Clinton was criticised for being a dry policy wonk now, apparently, she was a trendy proselytiser of identity politics. But analysis of her speeches shows that she talked largely about jobs and workers, and only occasionally women’s rights. So when men say Clinton talked too much about “identity politics” and that women shouldn’t protest, what I hear is, “Women should just shut up. ” Bad luck. Trump’s lies and attacks on the press show why these protests and fightbacks are necessary. As comedian Aziz Ansari said on Saturday Night Live last week, “Change doesn’t come from presidents. Change comes from large groups of angry people. ” We’re here, we’re angry and we’re ready."
102438,150563,"I ran Clinton’s campaign, and I fear Russia is meddling with more than elections",Guardian,Robby Mook,2017-02-07,2017.0,2.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/07/russia-hacked-us-election-democracy-vladimir-putin,"The Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and members of Hillary Clinton’s campaign is being treated too much like a novelty and not enough as a serious and persistent security threat. The problem becomes more urgent as we see it spread to other countries. WikiLeaks, which disseminated stolen DNC documents, announced last week that it would turn its attention to France, and has released material relating to presidential candidates François Fillon and Emmanuel Macron, opponents of Marine Le Pen. US intelligence agencies found clear links between Wikileaks and the Russian state we have to assume Russia will use these to undermine Vladimir Putin’s   Angela Merkel, when she faces the   Alternative für Deutschland at the polls in September. But there’s a deeper dimension to Russia’s actions, which deserves the free world’s urgent attention: its capacity to silently influence domestic legislation and   between elections. With his success in the US last year, Putin has put opponents on notice that there will be a price to pay for crossing him. Indeed, the complex infrastructure that Russia built to infect public discourse with false or stolen information isn’t going anywhere. It can be unleashed at any time, on any issue, domestic or international. This came into sharp relief this weekend when President Trump implied a sort of moral equivalence between the Putin regime and the US, a stunning reversal of   policy. We are no longer talking about how to confront Russia, but whether we should confront it at all  —   a big win for Putin. Trump and the   Mike Pence, have also been frighteningly tentative about whether to maintain sanctions against Moscow. But the example of President Trump is somewhat deceptive. Russian oligarchs eager to park their money in overseas real estate have been such an integral part of Trump’s personal fortune, and Putin’s role in this election was so outsized, it’s no wonder Trump is friendly. We may think that Trump is different  —   that his presidency, and this Russia problem, is temporary. Not so. What the Russians are doing by stealing documents, spending unlimited amounts of money and creating and distributing “fake news” has the potential to corrupt our political system to its core, if it hasn’t already. If Russia invades the Baltic states, could US assistance to them die in Congress because elected officials fear Russian retaliation? It sounds unbelievable, but we saw the GOP mysteriously change its platform this summer, removing aid to Ukraine  —   and that was before Putin proved his influence over the election. Take the example of Senator Marco Rubio, who used a recent US Senate confirmation hearing to call Putin out for his aggression towards Ukraine and support for the Bashar   regime. “We are not the same as Putin,” Rubio tweeted this weekend in reaction to Trump’s remarks. If Rubio decides to run for president in 2020, should he expect Russian hackers and their social media distribution system to team up and punish him  —   in the way that, say, the billionaire Koch brothers spent millions of dollars on negative advertising to punish Democrats for seeking to pass a national carbon policy in 2010? I can’t see any reason why not. Nor can I see any reason for China and other countries not to follow suit. We have to take action now to root out Russian and other foreign influences before they become too deeply enmeshed in our political ecosystem. First and foremost, leaders in the US and Europe must stop any attempt by the Trump administration to ease sanctions on Russia. It must be abundantly clear that attacking our elections through cyberspace will prompt a tough and proportional response. Second, all democratic governments must do much more to make electoral systems secure. That doesn’t just mean steps to protect ballots: political parties and their leaders must be defended as well. We also need stiff penalties for individuals who assist Russian intervention in our elections, as it seems  aides of Trump may have done. Facebook and Twitter have taken encouraging steps to filter out misleading content. Their continuing vigilance will be critical. We must also think about how to manage the presence of   news operations, such as Russia Today (rebranded as the more opaque RT) which can increase their reach through online promotion. The law makes no distinction between the New York Times and outlets like RT or China Daily, which are essentially   propaganda. Sadly, the unfiltered nature of much social media means many Americans don’t see much of a distinction either. Lastly, we must forcefully hold our elected officials accountable for addressing this. We need to make the repudiation of foreign interventions a campaign issue. In the US, we must call for protection against outside influence as frequently and vigorously as we have been calling for reforms to election financing, to give just one example. For liberal democracy to survive, we have to “drain the swamp” as Trump says. That must now include sapping the power of foreign adversaries to corrupt our public life."
102792,151048,Disappointing US jobs figures knock markets off peak,Guardian,Nick Fletcher,2017-06-02,2017.0,6.0,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/02/disappointing-us-jobs-figures-knock-markets-off-peak,"Global stock markets reached new peaks on Friday, but came off their best levels following disappointing US jobs data. Only 138, 000 jobs were created across the US in May, well below the expected level of 180, 000. March and April’s figures were revised down by 66, 000. The jobs figures came a day after upbeat manufacturing surveys from the UK, Europe and US, which helped outweigh concerns about the UK election and Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate deal. The UK outlook was also boosted on Friday by    construction figures, with the   construction purchasing managers’ index climbing from 53. 1 to 56 in May, compared with a forecasted fall to 52. 7. The FTSE 100 recorded a new closing high of 7, 547, up only slightly after a flurry of buying earlier in the day pushed the intraday peak to 7, 598. 99. The FTSE 250 also suffered a rollercoaster ride after initially hitting a new record of 20, 081 before ending the day at down slightly at 19, 977. Investors shrugged off continuing weakness in the pound as the Conservative lead over Labour continued to narrow in the latest opinion polls. But the FTSE 100 underperformed compared with its European counterparts, thanks to a slide in the oil price hitting commodity companies. Crude dropped more than 3% in the wake of Trump’s climate decision to below $49 a barrel for Brent crude, which analysts said could prompt US drillers to increase their output. This would outweigh the moves by Opec and its allies to cut production and would put more downward pressure on prices. The German Dax climbed 158 points to 12, 822 while the French CAC edged 24 points higher to 5, 343, and the MSCI   World index rose 0. 3% to a record high. Meanwhile, the US Dow Industrial Index moved higher in early trading, up 33 points to a fresh high of 21, 213. Analysts at Capital Economics said the modest increase in US jobs was “not too discouraging” and was likely to pick up again over the rest of the summer. It said: “After all, the employment rate declined to 4. 3% in May, its lowest level since 2001. With survey evidence suggesting it will fall below 4% in the next few months, and wage growth likely to pick up before long, we expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates steadily over the next year and a half. ” The US central bank has indicated that it will increase interest rates for a fourth time by 0. 25% after taking rates to near zero in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash. It has taken a cautious approach to increasing rates after the turmoil in global markets triggered in 2014 by hints from Fed bosses that higher   interest rates were likely. A hike could come as soon as a fortnight when Fed boss Janet Yellen and members of the Federal Open Market Committee next meet in Washington. In March the Fed pushed US base rates to 1% well above the 0. 25% set by the Bank of England. With only a week to go before the UK election and three weeks before the start of Brexit negotiations, Capital Economics said the FTSE 100 and UK economy were in for a bumpy ride. “Thursday’s general election will command the majority of attention this coming week. With the recent narrowing in the polls and major differences between the main parties both on Brexit and the stance and mix of fiscal policy, the outcome could have a rather greater impact on the economy and markets than the last few elections have done. ” Kully Samra, managing director at the stockbroker Charles Schwab, said the weaker than expected US jobs report was “merely a temporary blip on the radar”.  He said: “Wider US economic data remains buoyant and equity markets resilient, even in the face of the potential turmoil coming out of Washington. Underlying numbers are still robust which should help solidify June rate hike expectations. ” Marc Ostwald, a strategist at ADM Investor Services, said one of the risks to a calm week ahead of the Fed meeting was the appearance of former FBI boss James Comey before a congressional committee on Thursday. He said the UK election outcome and a wide range of economic data from China would also influence investor confidence."
102941,151269,"Bill calls for Fort Sumter, site of civil war’s beginning, to become national park",Guardian,,2016-09-11,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/fort-sumter-national-park-bill-tim-scott,"Tim Scott, the first black US senator from the deep south since Reconstruction, is proposing that the site where the civil war began be raised in status to that of a national park. The Republican has introduced a bill creating the Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie national park as the nation’s 60th national park and second in South Carolina. Fort Sumter, on Charleston Harbor, was bombarded by Confederate guns on 12 April 1861, a fight that started four years of civil war. Moultrie, on nearby Sullivan’s Island, is where American patriots turned back a British fleet trying to capture Charleston days before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Both forts are part of the Fort Sumter national monument, one of 84 national monuments among 413 sites administered by the National Park Service. Scott said a national park designation would give the forts a higher profile among the array of other national park properties and should mean more visitors to sites that now draw about 1 million visitors a year. “What we hope to do is bring more attention,” Scott said. “People know the first shots of the civil war but they don’t necessarily know the history dating back to the first years of our country and the significance Fort Moultrie played. ” It’s not the first effort to create a national park at the sites. Similar legislation was introduced by the late senator Strom Thurmond, a fellow Republican but a   staunch segregationist, in 2002. That bill died in committee. Scott said he hadn’t given much thought to the significance of a black man working to raise the status of a key civil war site. “South Carolina has a provocative history,” the former congressman said. “Perhaps part of that history is me representing in Congress the site where the civil war began and now, as a senator, hopefully making it into a park. ” He said the bill “resonates on both sides of the aisle and frankly I think it will resonate throughout the nation” and hopes it can pass this year. Tim Stone, the superintendent of the Fort Sumter national monument, said a national park designation would not expand the park or mean more budget money. “It just raises the profile and stature,” he said. “It gives the importance of Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie and their role in American history their proper due. ” He said status as a national park is important because many people plan their travels around visiting national parks. If you search online for national parks in South Carolina, the only thing that comes up is Congaree national park, near Columbia, he said. Jim Thompson, director of the Fort   Moultrie Historic Trust, a    group that helps support projects at the forts, is pleased a new park would have Moultrie in the name. The fort was only partially finished when troops under Col William Moultrie turned back a British fleet on 28 June 1776, six days before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. “Word got back to Philadelphia, which gave courage to some of those who were on the fence to go ahead and sign the Declaration of Independence,” Thompson said."

Like a brisk tennis game or a summer track meet, something performed in daylight between competitors. The cheap mattress bounced. She liked to do it more than once, and he was usually able to comply. Bourbon was his gasoline. Between sessions, he poured it at the counter while she lay panting on the sheets. Sweat burnished her body. The lean neck. The surprisingly full breasts. He would down another glass and return. He closed his eyes and heard himself make a gurgling sound. And as his trousers slipped down his legs all the burdens of his life to date seemed to fall away from him he tipped back his head and faced up into the darkness beneath the ceiling, and for one blessed moment he felt as if he could understand the things of this world in all their immeasurable beauty. How strange they are, he thought, life and all of these things. Then he felt Anezka slide down before him to the floor, felt her hands grab his naked buttocks and draw him to her. “Come, sonny boy!” he heard her whisper, and with a smile he let go. The walkway to the terminal was all carpet, no oxygen. Dilly bundled Finn into the first restroom on offer, locked the cubicle door and pulled at his leather belt. “You’re beautiful,” she told him, going down on to her haunches and unzipping him. He watched her passport rise gradually out of the back pocket of her jeans in time with the rhythmic bobbing of her buttocks as she sucked him. He arched over her back and took hold of the passport before it landed on the pimpled floor. Despite the immediate circumstances, human nature obliged him to take a look at her passport photo.  When his hand goes to my breasts, my feet are envious. I slide my hands down his back, all along his spine, rutted with bone like mud ridges in a dry field, to the audacious swell below. His finger is inside me, his thumb circling, and I spill like grain from a bucket. He is panting, still running his race. I laugh at the incongruous size of him, sticking to his stomach and escaping from the springing hair below.  Once they were in that room, Jason had slammed the door and devoured her with his mouth, his hands, which were everywhere. As if he were ravenous. And she remembered standing in front of him, her dress a puddle on the floor, and how she’d started to shake, her knees knocking together, like she was a virgin, like this was the first time. Because had she allowed herself to hope, this was what she would’ve hoped for. And now here it was. And that was terrifying. Jason had taken her hand and placed it over his bare chest, to his heart, which was pounding wildly, in tandem with hers. She’d thought he was just excited, turned on. It had not occurred to her that he might be terrified, too. She pushed on my hips, an order that thrust me in. I entered her. Not only my prick, but the whole of me entered her, into her guts, into her darkness, eyes wide open, seeing nothing. My whole body had gone inside her. I went in with her thrusts and stayed still. While I got used to the quiet and the pulsing of my blood in my ears and nose, she pushed me out a little, then in again. She did it again and again, holding me with force and moving me to the rhythm of the surf. She wiggled her breasts beneath my hands and intensified the pushing. I went in up to my groin and came out almost entirely. My body was her gearstick."

The Moroccan Association of Human Rights said an autopsy after the girl’s death last week showed that she was pregnant. The AMDH Marrakesh head, Omar Arbib, said “eight young men abducted the girl,” then 16, last year from Ben Guerir, 43 miles (70km) north of Marrakesh, “and then took turns to rape her”. Her family lodged a complaint and police arrested seven suspects, who were referred to the prosecutor for questioning, Arbib said. An eighth suspect was later arrested. However, according to Arbib, the prosecutor granted the suspects a provisional release. After being freed, he said, they threatened the victim, saying they would “publish pictures of the rape which they had taken with their mobile phones unless she dropped the complaint against them”. “This is the reason why last Friday she set herself on fire,” Arbib said. The girl suffered   burns and died the following day in hospital. Her death prompted the prosecutor to order the rearrest of six of the eight suspects who were detained, Arbib said. It was not immediately clear why the other two suspects were not rearrested. In 2011, Morocco adopted a new constitution enshrining gender equality and urging the state to promote it, but concerns remain around sexual harassment. According to Moroccan NGOs, 80% of sex attacks affect children aged mostly between 5 and 14. In many cases, the assailants are family members. In January 2014, Morocco abandoned a highly controversial law that allowed rapists of underage people to escape punishment if they marry their victims. The legislation made headlines globally in March 2012 when Amina Filali, 16, killed herself after being forced to marry the man who had allegedly raped her and remained free."

This was perhaps the only opportunity the presidential candidate I have endorsed  —   Jill Stein  —   and her running mate, Ajamu Baraka, to have the ear of a large portion of the mainstream American electorate. There was little room for error. They spent little time directly criticizing Donald Trump. This was a wise move, since virtually no one among Stein’s potential base of support is considering Trump as a viable option. Instead, she focused on Hillary Clinton.  At a moment where the Clinton campaign is still attempting to secure the support of frustrated Bernie Sanders primary voters, Stein demonstrated that Clinton’s brand of liberalism does not represent the tone or spirit of the Sanders campaign. By highlighting Clinton’s   politics and active role in hawkish foreign policy, Stein raised considerable doubt about Clinton’s leftist bona fides. “I will have trouble sleeping at night if Donald Trump is elected,” Stein said. “I will also have trouble sleeping at night if Hillary Clinton is elected. ” Throughout the event, both Stein and Baraka rightly refuted the idea that superficial identity politics are enough to constitute a progressive movement. Stein destroyed the notion that a vote for Clinton is a feminist move, as Clinton’s   stances and neoliberal economic policies have compromised the lives and prosperity of women and families around the globe. Baraka drew from Barack Obama’s presidential record to show that electing a black president has not signaled a turn away from   racism at the systemic or interpersonal levels. Stein also raised doubts about Clinton’s trustworthiness. While these arguments are not new, they carried a different level of veracity when separated from the hypocritical and sexist “crooked Hillary” rhetoric of the Trump campaign. Drawing from Clinton’s own   playbook, Stein used Clinton’s email scandal and missteps abroad as a springboard to question Clinton’s judgment.  Of course, such critiques would have been more effective if the possibility of a nuclear armed Trump weren’t lingering in the back of voter’s minds, but they nonetheless focused appropriate scrutiny to the secretary’s actions. But Stein and Baraka did not merely tell voters what to vote against, they also gave them something to vote for. Throughout the night, the candidates used their time to articulate the Green party’s vision for the future. Specifically, Stein talked about workable plans to create peace in the Middle East, a plan that includes nuclear disarmament, a call to end the Israeli occupation of Palestine and a loosening of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and World Trade Organization’s economic strangleholds on the globe’s most vulnerable nations.  Baraka offered a workable vision of a nation without state violence, inner cities without police as occupying forces and vulnerable citizens not viewed as enemy combatants. For the first time since Bernie Sanders stepped out of the Democratic race, the American public was given an opportunity to dream out loud for a few hours about freedom, justice and true democracy. Despite the town hall’s success, the Green party has a long way to go to snag a significant slice of undecided, Independent and   voters. The challenge of the   campaign will be to convince voters of a   political vision, one that isn’t prisoner to our collective obsession with individual elections or hyperbolic fear of particular candidates.  They will have to persuade voters to believe that the   system, when underwritten by endless corporate money, does not offer the “lesser of two evils” but a fundamental threat to democracy itself. Surely, they have a long way to go to achieve these goals. But they’ve made an incredible start."

Members of the public, he says, often tell him how much turbulence perturbs them, and though he doesn’t remotely share their anxiety, he understands it perfectly. In the sky, after all, we cede control of our future to someone who is unknown to us. Most people, moreover, know very little about the construction of aircraft, much less the endlessly rehearsed systems that keep them above the clouds we understand aerodynamics not at all. So when the long metal tube in which we are travelling begins to bob and buck, no wonder our hearts beat a little faster, our palms grow hot and sticky. We are human and we panic, even if some of us try very hard indeed not to show the extent of our fear to the man in the aisle seat who is reading Time magazine so nonchalantly. Across the coffee table  —   we are in a suite at Claridge’s in west London, where the art deco furniture is a rather appropriate shade of air force blue  —   Sullenberger meets my eye and holds it. “Now,” he says. “I have some specific advice about turbulence and how you might reframe your thinking about it. ” A brief pause. “Next time you’re a passenger in an automobile, I want you to close your eyes and really concentrate on every bump and jolt in the road. I want you to catalogue them and then to imagine that you are also trying to read or to eat a meal. ” Another pause. “It would be difficult. The reality is that the average car trip is much rougher than almost any flight. But the difference is that the driver is known to us and it’s familiar: we understand how cars work. ” His voice rises a notch, in the manner of a motivational speaker. “Airplanes are designed to handle the worst turbulence, plus a safety margin of 50% and pilots are trained to avoid it when they can and to manage it by changing speed and altitude. They are going to take care of you. The airplane is not going to come apart. This is just a temporary inconvenience. ” Am I soothed? Yes. In this mode, he’s mesmeric. But it’s hard not to laugh, too. If only director Clint Eastwood had had the wit to call his new movie about Sullenberger This Is Just a Temporary Inconvenience. Sullenberger is the pilot who, on 15 January 2009, successfully landed his Airbus 320 in the Hudson river, New York, saving the lives of all 155 passengers and crew after the aircraft struck a flock of birds, putting both engines out of action, shortly after its   from LaGuardia airport. Naturally, the film inspired by his story, Sully, does its best to point up his extraordinary valour on that day this is the guy who, after all, walked up and down a rapidly sinking plane not once but twice in an effort to make sure no one remained on board before he cut the life rafts loose. But the man at its heart, on screen as in real life  —   Sullenberger is played by (who else?) Tom Hanks  —   is a stubbornly   kind of a hero, distinctly minimalist in the matter of public displays of emotion basically, he’s John Wayne with a mobile phone and a   bag. Ask him, for instance, what he really said to first officer Jeff Skiles in the moments after the plane hit the deathly cold water  —   surely the movie’s screenwriter exaggerated his composure just a little  —   and without missing a beat he’ll reply: “It wasn’t as bad as we thought. ” (The last time I heard these words, it was Hanks who was saying them and I was fanning myself with a copy of the Evening Standard and trying not to pass out.) What is it like, revisiting these events on screen? Sullenberger and his wife and two daughters first saw the film at a studio in California last July. “It was an emotional moment,” he says, sounding neither shaken nor stirred. “It took us several hours to process it, to put it into words. We saw it in Burbank, and then we flew back to San Francisco, and when we were home having dinner, my younger daughter said, after some period of silence: are we going to talk about this or what? So we did. We had the most wonderful, touching and, in some cases, humorous discussion about it. ” Is it accurate? “Yes. Everyone worked hard to get it right. The granularity was amazing to me. They wanted to know: what are your rings like? What kind of watch do you wear? When you sit down in the cockpit do you take off your jacket and loosen your tie? I even had Clint, Tom and Aaron [Eckhart, who plays Skiles] in a flight simulator with me to familiarise themselves with the dynamic of the cockpit. The flying sequence in the film is very realistic. ” Though partly based on it, the film takes the story further than Sullenberger’s 2009 memoir, Highest Duty, a book that was published before the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)  —   the agency charged by the US Congress with investigating air accidents  —   completed its investigation into the crash, a process that in reality took some 15 months, but in the film appears to last only a matter of days. Immediately after the accident, Sullenberger was widely hailed as a hero by the media, for which reason I, like most people, had never thought he could possibly be seen in any other light. Behind the scenes, however, machinery was turning. In spite of the seeming miracle on the Hudson, he would have to wait to be vindicated for the decision he made that day. He had saved lives, but he had lost a plane. The investigators believed their simulations might show that he could have made it back to LaGuardia they also believed, for a while, that only one of the plane’s engines had ceased to function. How nervous was he about the investigation? “Initially, very nervous. First of all, the trauma of the event was so intense. We all suffered from PTSD [  stress disorder]. My pulse and my blood pressure were highly elevated for several months and at first I could only sleep for 30 minutes at a time. Added to the uncertainty of the investigation and the possible threat to my professional reputation, it was a very difficult period. But we had to have what I call realistic optimism, [to hold on to the idea] that we would prevail. ” While the various bodies involved, among them US Airways, the airline for which Sullenberger worked Airbus, the manufacturer of the aircraft and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) the body responsible for regulating civil aviation in the US, protected their own interests, the US Airline Pilots Association worked tirelessly on his behalf. “The investigators from the NTSB were not there to be on my side. Their purpose is to be on the side of truth and fact. They were going to follow that wherever it led. Our professional reputations were expendable. I was just an individual. I am sure they would have thrown me under the bus if necessary. ” Ultimately, the test pilots, who, in a simulated reconstruction of events, had managed to take the failing plane back to LaGuardia, were revealed to have practised the manoeuvre multiple times. Once this was known, Sullenberger’s reaction times, born of an unpreparedness quite different from theirs, had only to be factored in for their models to fall apart and the plane to crash in the next simulation. The investigators concluded that he had, after all, made the right decision. On the page, though, this perhaps makes it seem as if Sullenberger had a period in which to think, to weigh up his options, which he certainly didn’t. Look at the transcripts of the conversations between the cockpit of US Airways flight 1549 and air traffic control on that fateful day and you’ll see  —   the heart turns over at the sight of it  —   that “time” in this context, is close to being a redundant term, as useless as a map or a bottle of champagne. US Airways flight 1539 was cleared for takeoff at 15. 25. 09 the bird strike took place at 15. 27. 11 the plane made its emergency landing at 15. 30. 43. In other words, between the engines dying and splashdown in the Hudson, there were just three minutes and 32 seconds. This morning  —   I cast him a feeble look, which he deflects with one of what you might call gracious pity  —   it took me longer than that to get of the house. Can he describe those three minutes and 32 seconds? He nods, but I’m not sure that he really is able to, save for to make it clear that dying was the very last thing on his mind. What kicked in at this point was first his training and, second, his temperament: “I thought about solving all the problems we had and I was confident that we could do so, even though, at the outset, I wouldn’t have been able to tell you exactly what we were going to end up doing. Once I knew my only option was the river [LaGuardia and another airport, Teterboro, having been ruled out as too far away] I stuck with it. I didn’t waver. I knew it meant sacrificing the aeroplane. I knew people would be deciding whether what I did was right or wrong perhaps for decades. But that didn’t bother me. I didn’t let it interfere with what I had to do. I never once thought about my family or any extraneous thing at all. I was flying the aeroplane and I was flying it well. ” Sullenberger, born in 1951 and the son of a dentist, grew up in Denison, Texas. He knew he wanted to be a pilot as a small boy  —   witness the delight on his face in a photo taken on Christmas morning when, aged eight, his parents gave him a model aeroplane  —   and took his first solo flight, having had lessons from a   pilot, at the age of just 16. In 1973, he graduated from the US Air Force Academy and thereafter enjoyed a military career  —   though he never served in any conflict  —   until, in 1980, he became a commercial airline pilot. By 2009, then, he had more than four decades of experience in the cockpit, in fighter planes and in passenger jets. He still loved the job, but the cutbacks that had taken place in the industry since 11 September 2001, had also begun to get him down. Before he set off on the   trip that would end with the downing of flight 1549, he made himself two sandwiches, one turkey and one peanut butter and jelly. The airline no longer provided its pilots and flight attendants with meals, not even on longer flights. Almost the first question he would be asked by the accident investigators was about his   levels that afternoon. His schedule was to take him from Charlotte to Pittsburgh, where he and his crew would stop over for 10 hours, and then from Pittsburgh to Charlotte to LaGuardia, New York, and then back to Charlotte again. As the final leg began, he was in cheery mood. He and Skiles, a pilot with whom he had never flown before that trip, had made up some of the time lost earlier in the day, the snow had stopped falling and the flight he hoped to get from Charlotte back home to San Francisco was showing on time, with a seat available it looked like he would make it there before his wife, Lorrie, and his two daughters, Kate and Kelly, went to bed. The plane had been in the air for about 95 seconds, and had not yet risen to 3, 000 feet, when he saw them: a   of Canada geese, birds that can weigh up to 18lbs and have 6ft wingspans. There was no time (that weasel word again) to react. The aircraft was travelling at 316ft per second and the birds were only about a football field away. The cockpit voice recorder captured what followed. “Birds!” said Sullenberger. “Whoah!” said Skiles. After this, there came thumps and thuds, followed by a shuddering sound. “Oh, shit!” said Skiles. “Oh, yeah,” said Sullenberger. Another noise could then be heard: a change in the plane’s engines. “” said Skiles. Sullenberger had hit birds three or four times previously in his career and they had never even dented the plane, but this was different. He could feel the engines protesting, abnormal vibrations that signalled the destruction of the finely balanced machinery inside, and there was a terrible smell, too, of burning birds. Seconds later, he and Skiles felt a sudden, complete and bilaterally symmetrical loss of thrust. An eerie quietness fell. The only noise they could hear now sounded like a stick being held against moving bicycle spokes. In all his years as a pilot, he had never lost even one engine. Today, it seemed, he had lost two. “My aircraft,” he said to Skiles. “Your aircraft,” Skiles replied. This was protocol. Sullenberger would now be at the controls and Skiles (who had to that point been flying the plane) would handle the emergency checklist, something that, believe it or not, he would now look up in the plane’s   handbook. Lucky they thought to make it “quick”. The plane was descending at a rate of more than 1, 000ft per minute. If you can’t imagine this  —   I don’t want to imagine it  —   that’s the equivalent of a lift descending two storeys every second.   seconds had passed since the bird strike. “Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!” said Sullenberger to Patrick Harten, the air traffic controller assigned to flight 1549. At LaGuardia, the runway that could be reached by the shortest path was cleared. But it was no good. “We’re unable,” said Sullenberger. “We may end up in the Hudson. ” In the circumstances, the river seemed relatively “welcoming”: it was long enough, wide enough and smooth enough. Plus, it was right there, available. Flight simulators don’t allow pilots to train for landing on water. But what other choice did he have? The only control he had over the plane’s vertical path now was pitch  —   the raising or lowering of its nose. His goal was to maintain a pitch that would give a proper glide speed, using gravity to provide the forward motion of the aircraft, slicing the wings through the air to create lift. Only about 90 seconds before he hit the water  —   when he would pull the nose full aft at last  —   did he address the passengers. “This is the captain,” he said. “Brace for impact. ” Instructing passengers to brace is standard procedure. But he chose the word “impact” himself, hoping it would prepare everyone for what he thought might  —   might!  —   be a hard landing. In his memoir, Sullenberger writes that even as he grasped that the plane, having hit the water, was intact, he worried about the difficulties that still lay ahead. It was sinking: everyone had to be evacuated and quickly. Outside, should anyone fall in, things would not look good for them the temperatures were freezing, they would survive only for a few minutes. In truth, though, the next   went like clockwork. Because the plane had landed between two ferry terminals, rescue vessels arrived quickly, the first within four minutes people did not have to perch on the inflatable life rafts for long. It was all so unreal. Sullenberger was soaked up to the waist, but his mobile phone, for instance, was still dry and working and he would soon use it to tell Lorrie what had happened, reaching her even before she saw the pictures on TV. A man on the wing could be seen holding on to his suit bag: “an unnecessary accessory at a time like that” as he puts it. Following its investigation into these events, the NTSB made no fewer than 35 recommendations for safety improvements. Only six of them, however, have been adopted and Sullenberger, who, since his retirement about a year after the accident, now spends much of his time talking about such issues, is disappointed. “As a   business, the industry is reluctant to take on extra safety measures unless they are mandated by the FAA,” he says. It was only by chance, for instance, that flight 1549 had lifejackets under every seat most internal US flights still don’t carry them. Meanwhile, certain risks increase. “Bird populations have grown and the number of flights has increased, so statistically speaking the risk of bird strike has gone up. People are working on   radars that can detect them earlier, but there is no magic bullet. Drones, too, are a growing problem. If   birds can bring down an airliner, imagine what a drone might do. It’s only a matter of time. ” Still, the greater part of him seems to regard what happened that day as a kind of blessing. “What you can get used to is amazing,” he says, showing me some of the medals for valour he has since received. “That famous flight has given me a bully pulpit that has allowed me to contribute greatly, to become a de facto spokesperson for my industry. ” It has taken him, too, to some wonderful places, among them President Obama’s inauguration. What, I wonder, does he make of Donald Trump, a man whose temperament is, it is quite obvious, diametrically opposed to his own? (Clint Eastwood was one of Trump’s starrier supporters.) For a few moments, he talks about leadership and   and I wonder if he is going to duck the issue (in 2009, the Republicans suggested he might run for Congress, and though he turned them down, he confesses he was “honoured” to have been asked). But, no. “I am very concerned about what has happened,” he says. “I hope that the people we’re talking about can rise to the occasion. ” Does he think that they will? I sense that he doesn’t. “We have survived many crises, just as the British have, and I’m sure we will find a way to survive even this,” he goes on, sounding like he has come straight out of The West Wing. “Years from now, we don’t want our grandchildren to ask us why we didn’t get involved, why we didn’t speak up when it mattered. I feel that obligation intensely and I think many others do, too. ” He doesn’t salute, but he might as well have done. Sullenberger is, it seems, reporting for duty. Standing up, I’m almost tempted to click my heels. Sully is released on 2 December.

104522,153299,Richard Dreyfuss: ‘When I die I want the chance to hit God in the face’,Guardian,Candice Pires,2016-07-24,2016.0,7.0,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/24/richard-dreyfuss-reckless-when-i-die-i-want-the-chance-to-hit-god-in-the-face,"When I die I hope I’ll have a chance to hit God in the face. If there is a God he already knows about this and he’ll get away  —   and as an agnostic I probably won’t get the chance. But he deserves it because of everything that happens to you in the third act of life: it’s humiliating and debasing. My mother was my best friend. We talked about everything. I learned a lot about women and sex from her. She once said to me: “Richard, to put your mind at rest, there’s nothing you don’t do in the bedroom. ” People say nice things to me about Jaws and Close Encounters. And I say: “They’re Steven’s [Spielberg] films. ” I didn’t do my films until The Goodbye Girl. And then I did them for the rest of my life. I love the ideals of my country. But I hate that we’ve been so denied any real knowledge of the world and don’t have the education to think clearly, so we vote against our economic interest and believe in our most shallow first thoughts of fear and hatred. I think I have the finest body of work of any American actor. It truly reflects my principles. But I am perceived as someone who has fallen. That I was a big   in the 70s and fell away. I see it as I didn’t want to be top of the top, because none of them leave their homes or have a normal life. I was given the chance to get up there and I turned it down. One day I realised I’d hurt every girl I’d ever loved. I had thought I was a really good guy before that. I gathered myself together and wrote letters, apologising. The response was uniform: “This ship has sailed, pal. ” I knew I was a manic depressive when I was 13 or 14, and I loved it. I always told people what I had and I was always cresting on a manic wave. I used it, willingly and happily, and it was an extraordinary experience. When I got hit with the depressive side  —   Boom!  —   yes, it was horrible and unendurable, but that’s part of the story. I never shared my life with anyone until I met Svetlana [Dreyfuss’s third wife]. I was staying in a hotel where she worked when she knocked on my door, saying: “You should take better care of your things,” and handed me my passport. We talked and I invited her in. Eventually, I said: “Well, I guess you’d better get back. ” We both stood up, I took a deep breath and kissed her. She ran out of the room. I thought: “This is going to be great. ” Trump is an intemperate,   lying bully. If a man like that asked you for permission to marry your daughter, what would your answer be? If it’s no, I think it’s obvious we shouldn’t give him the most powerful office on the face of the Earth. I was never a Hollywood insider. I had to learn that people do unethical things and it’s just business. I took it all personally and still do. Reckless is out on DVD on 25 July"
104933,153845,Protesters pushed back after mass arrests at North Dakota pipeline site – as it happened,Guardian,Sam Levin,2017-06-23,2017.0,6.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/27/north-dakota-access-pipeline-police-protesters-live-updates,"Things are calming down at the Dakota Access Pipeline protest near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, as night falls. It’s been an eventful day. 117 protesters have been arrested at the Standing Rock camp, a spokesperson for the Morton County sheriff’s department says. “Currently law enforcement is engaged in a situation at the backwater bridge, just north of the main camp. Protester have lit a fire near the bridge,” the spokesperson said in a statement. 117 protesters have been arrested. Morton County will be utilizing other jails in this mass arrest operation. Here are some of the latest images from photographers on the frontline of today’s standoff:  Here’s the Guardian’s photo gallery of the day’s events: Standing Rock tribal chairman Dave Archambault just released a statement. “Militarized law enforcement agencies moved in on water protectors with tanks and riot gear today,” the statement says. “We continue to pray for peace. We call on the state of North Dakota to oversee the actions of local law enforcement to, first and foremost, ensure everyone’s safety. ” The statement continues: The Department of Justice must send overseers immediately to ensure the protection of First Amendment rights and the safety of thousands here at Standing Rock. DOJ can no longer ignore our requests. If harm comes to any who come here to stand in solidarity with us, it is on their watch. They must step in and hold the state of North Dakota and Morton County accountable for their acts of violence against innocent, prayerful people. The Obama administration has asked DAPL to voluntarily halt construction until the review process has been completed, but DAPL has ignored these repeated requests. By deploying law enforcement to support DAPL construction, the State of North Dakota is collaborating with Energy Transfer Partners and escalating tensions. We need our state and federal governments to bring justice and peace to our lands, not the force of armored vehicles. We have repeatedly seen a disproportionate response from law enforcement to water protectors’ nonviolent exercise of their constitutional rights. Today we have witnessed people praying in peace, yet attacked with pepper spray, rubber bullets, sound and concussion cannons. We urge state and federal government agencies to give this tense situation their immediate and close attention. We also call on the thousands of water protectors who stand in solidarity with us against DAPL to remain in peace and prayer. Any act of violence hurts our cause and is not welcome here. We invite all supporters to join us in prayer that, ultimately, the right decision —  the moral decision —  is made to protect our people, our sacred places, our land and our resources.  We won’t step down from this fight. As peoples of this earth, we all need water. This is about our water, our rights, and our dignity as human beings. The Morton County sheriff’s department has released a new statement clarifying their earlier release regarding firearm incidents: At around 5:30 law enforcement received a report of gun shots being fired near a bridge just north of the main camp. A person was injured. Law enforcement have one person in custody.  In a separate incident, a woman was being placed under arrest and pulled a weapon and fired three shots near officers who were holding a line. She was taken into custody. No officers were injured.  One key difference is that officials are now saying that a weapon was fired “near officers” rather than “at” officers, as the previous statement alleged. Some pictures from today’s events: A spokesperson for the Morton County sheriff’s department has sent the Guardian a statement about several separate incidents involving firearms at the protest today, including one in which a woman being placed under arrest allegedly shot at law enforcement officers. The statement in full: We have received reports of several incidents involving firearms. 1) Situation involved a private individual who was run off the road by protestors. The victim was shot in the hand and is being treated. An investigation in underway. No law enforcement was involved with this shooting. 2) At the front line on Highway 1806, a woman who was being placed under arrest, pulled a . 38 caliber revolver and fired three shots at law enforcement, narrowly missing a sheriff’s deputy. She was taken into custody with no shots fired by law enforcement. 3) Ten shots were reported in the area. It’s possible it is local hunters. This incident is under investigation. Democratic nominee for president Hillary Clinton has weighed in on the situation. In a statement to NBC News, Clinton campaign spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said:  From the beginning of this campaign, Secretary Clinton has been clear that she thinks all voices should be heard and all views considered in federal infrastructure projects. Now, all of the parties involved  —   including the federal government, the pipeline company and contractors, the state of North Dakota, and the tribes  —   need to find a path forward that serves the broadest public interest. As that happens, it’s important that on the ground in North Dakota, everyone respects demonstrators’ rights to protest peacefully, and workers’ rights to do their jobs safely. Here’s a little more about what exactly that means. The original protest camp  —   Sacred Stone  —   is on tribal land owned by Lakota Sioux tribal member Ladonna Allard, on the west bank of the Missouri river, just south of where the smaller Cannonball river flows into it. As it grew, the camp multiplied and spread. Teepees sprung up along the west bank of the Cannonball  —   the new camp was formed by Rosebud Sioux  —   and then up to the county road, and then across the road bridge on to the east bank. The area on the east bank, where there is much more space, became the main camp once the ranks of protesters swelled in August. That land is owned by the Army Corps of Engineers. Further east along the road, toward the Missouri river, is the construction site. That’s the place that protesters erected teepees in protest today, and it is that site from which they have been cleared by police. Protesters are currently being pushed back along the county road towards the main camp on the east bank of the Cannonball, where they will be allowed  —   for now  —   to stay, according to Morton County sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier. Protesters have been pushed out of the North Camp, on land owned by Dakota Access, and are being pushed down the road back to the original camp by police driving armored vehicles. Hoferer is still live on Facebook: In a press conference just now, Morton County sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said that “numerous more arrestees” on top of the 16 already confirmed are en route to the police station. “I can’t give you numbers, but right now they are arresting individuals . .. [who will be charged with] anywhere from public nuisance to inciting a riot. He said that the north camp, which is on land owned by the Dakota Access pipeline’s parent company, was now clear, but he said that police were planning to be there “as long as it takes” to keep protesters off the pipeline’s land. Kirchmeier confirmed that pepper spray had been used but said that tear gas, rubber bullets or beanbag rounds had not been deployed  —   “Not that I’m aware of. ” He said that there were more than 200 police officers on the scene."

He even has the support of President Barack Obama, the coach told a gala dinner in Berlin. In an interview with Reuters, Klinsmann said he was disappointed “and even angry” that his team had lost two World Cup qualifiers in the space of five days, having let in a late goal against the run of play to lose   at home to Mexico. But he added that the team had played well at times during 2016 and would bounce back and win at least 15 points from the 24 available in the next eight qualifying games, which should enable the US to qualify from the Concacaf region.  The top three of the six teams go through, with the   country going into a   against a team from Asia. The US and Trinidad  Tobago are both pointless after two games.  “It’s important to put this in the right perspective,” he said. “We lost the two opening games and played the two best teams right away. We have eight more games to get the points needed to qualify. We’ve always reacted strongly when things were  .  “This team is always capable of reacting. We’ll correct this with the two games in March [against Honduras and Panama] and we’ll take one game at a time from there to get our points. I’m 1, 000% sure we’ll qualify. ”  Klinsmann said he was aware of the criticism in the media and calls for his dismissal after five years in the job, but he will not jettison his plan to patiently develop a team that would peak at the right time at Russia 2018.  “When things go slightly wrong, there are some people who come out and are ready to chop your head off,” he said. “In the long run, that’s going to make the development of the team difficult. It’s important to stay calm and be patient.  “There are definitely issues to be addressed but there is no reason to exaggerate them or panic,” he added. “I’ve been doing this for 35 years and there are always many reasons why certain things happen, both positively and negatively.  “It’s important to have the end result in mind. And the big picture is the overall development of the team in the   cycle between two World Cups. You have to be ready to take some setbacks during that phase. ”  Klinsmann said the players were also confident that they had learned important lessons from the two losses, including failing to capitalise on their scoring chances against Mexico and then conceding a late goal at a corner due to poor marking.  “Sometimes you learn more from defeat than wins,” he said. “Not everything will go perfectly in 2017 on the path to the World Cup. The team is still in the process of finding itself. We’ve seen strong improvements of some young players this year but we’re still hoping one or two younger players will emerge. ”  With 12 wins, six losses and one draw, he felt 2016 had been a solid year   “except for the finish”   and called the US team’s wins against Costa Rica, Paraguay, Ecuador at the Copa America to reach the last four a seminal moment for US soccer.  “We had a maturing process at the Copa America that was outstanding,” he said. “We wanted to have younger players becoming more powerful and confident and got that. There is a real dynamic going on with players like Bobby Wood, John Brooks, Jordan Morris and Christian Pulisic. ”  Klinsmann quoted President Obama telling him at a   brainstorming meeting that also included a Nobel Prize winner, leading scientists and astronauts, that there was still a long way to go on the road to Russia.  “He said, ‘Coach, it didn’t go well in Costa Rica, but it’s only the start of the World Cup qualifying and you’ll get back on the right track.’ He understands that it’s a long qualifying process. He also understands dynamics of soccer as a global sport and how it builds bridges. ”"
106235,156852,I’m a veteran of many illnesses. It was needing crutches that scared me most,Guardian,Sally Franson,2016-10-21,2016.0,10.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/21/walking-with-crutches-illness-veteran-recovery,"“There’s no elevator in the theater,” the teenage ticket seller said.  “But that’s ableist!” I said. I shifted on my crutches.  The guy mumbled sorry like I was his grandma chewing him out for cussing. Sorry, I’d have to ask an employee to meet me at a side entrance on the second floor of the movie theater, exit through the lobby, hobble down the hallway, then up, over and back toward the screening room, which was on the far side of the building.   “It’s really not that far,” he said.   “Easy for you to say. ” I huffed toward the stairs. They took 10 minutes to climb. My boyfriend had taken me to the movies to cheer me up, but I wasn’t cheered I was fuming. When we got to the second floor, we were greeted by two women, one of whom was in a wheelchair. She gestured toward a dark hallway. “There’s an elevator, you know,” she said.   “I don’t need it,” I said without meeting her gaze. “I’m fine. ”  But I did need it, and I wasn’t fine. In fact, I’d blasted my ankle in half a week before at a trampoline park. A silly injury for a grown woman, and far from the worst that I’ve weathered, if you count the stage III cancer (age 25) getting hit by a car (age 28) mononucleosis (age 20) PTSD (chronic) cysts (occasional) and sports injuries of all permutations.  With enough health crises under my belt to match an average senior citizen, I fancied myself rather wise, a sophisticated traveler between, as Susan Sontag writes in Illness as Metaphor, the kingdoms of the sick and well.  When my ankle broke, though, I behaved not as a sophisticated traveler but a petulant child. Before long I was changing clinics, scorning podiatrists, throwing tantrums with billing offices. Beneath my posture of fearless   was a primal resistance to swapping kingdoms. I do not belong here, I tried to explain to this medical cabal, this whole crowd of people insisting on treating me like a sick person. You must have me confused with someone else. It’s not so much that I’m afraid of misfortune. It’s more a fear that the internal voice insisting my misfortune is unnatural  —   my suffering an aberration  —   is wrong. That I’m not more entitled to working legs than anyone else. Unsurprising, then, that when strangers asked about my injury I made sure to say it was temporary, and unsurprising in the saddest way that, when met with kinship by the woman in the wheelchair, I averted my eyes. I did not want to take the elevator in the movie theater, or meet the gaze of the woman in the wheelchair, because to do so I would have to acknowledge two uncomfortable truths: one, that I am fragile and two, that I am just like her. If fortune favors the bold, misfortune, in popular myth, is saved for the weak. In truth, we are all equally subject to misfortune. This is scary. Unsurprising, then, that our elderly are shuffled off to homes, that movie theaters like mine do the bare minimum to make their facilities more accessible to those abled differently.  These truths work in direct opposition to that insidious inner voice. And they tend to tumble into all sorts of other uncomfortable truths about the choices we make daily between compassion and   between being in the world and staying in an insulated, isolated comfort zone. My neediness makes the customary isolation and insulation become impossible. The voice hates this. It roars louder about my exceptionalism. It throws barbs at hapless ticket sellers and ignores strangers who try to help me.  But I haven’t been in a position to heed the voice much since breaking my ankle. So out of necessity, I’ve learned that, if I can wrap my arms around this voice, something interesting happens. The root of the word able is from the Latin habere, which means to hold. The fear that I am no different from you, from the woman in the wheelchair, when held long enough, becomes the refuge.  I am frail, so are you we must care for each other. I wish it did not take me breaking my ankle to remember this, but maybe it is only by breaking that I remember. The cracks are where we learn to see."
106324,156968,Wrong man cremated in mix-up of two corpses with same name,Guardian,,2016-10-29,2016.0,10.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/29/cremation-mistake-los-angeles-coroner,"A    man was mistakenly cremated, after a Los Angeles County coroner’s technician confused his remains with those of another man with the same name, a spokesman for the coroner’s office said. The Los Angeles Times reported that office spokesman Armand Montiel explained on Friday that two men named Jorge Hernandez were at the morgue. One died of an accidental drug overdose earlier this month and the other was indigent and scheduled to be cremated. The mistake occurred when the coroner’s attendant matched the name on the man’s body but failed to check the coroner case number, Montiel said. That person sent the wrong remains for cremation. “It was an oversight caused by human error,” Montiel said in a statement. The attendant realized the mistake when a mortuary assistant arrived that same day to pick up the young man’s remains and discovered his body had already been cremated. Montiel said the chief medical examiner had apologized to the man’s family. “The department is profoundly sorry for any additional discomfort that this has caused the loved ones of Mr Hernandez,” Montiel said. Hernandez’s parents filed separate claims against the office on Thursday, saying they had intended to donate his organs and were making funeral arrangements when they received the news. “They are culpable,” said Luis Carrillo, the family’s attorney. “They denied this family visitation. They denied this family the chance to remember their son. ” The coroner’s office has been struggling to reduce a backlog in cases due to staffing shortages. The LA Times reported that as of 21 September, toxicology and other tests had not been completed on more than 1, 500 bodies, down from 2, 100 in June."
106388,157060,Death toll from Oakland ’Ghost Ship’ warehouse fire rises to 33 killed,Guardian,Alan Yuhas,2016-12-04,2016.0,12.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/04/oakland-ghost-ship-warehouse-fire-deaths-24,"Oakland officials on Sunday increased the death toll of a warehouse fire to 33 people, as the mayor announced that a criminal investigation team has joined the inquiry into how an unauthorized party became one of the worst disasters in the city’s history. At an afternoon briefing, a spokesman for the Alameda county sheriff, Sgt Ray Kelly, said 33 people had been confirmed killed. He said that investigators had only searched about  % of the warehouse ruins, in Oakland’s Fruitvale neighborhood, and that the families of seven victims had been notified about the deaths. “Our first priority is the humane and compassionate removal of the victims of this tragedy,” said Mayor Libby Schaaf. “Secondly we are focused on supporting the families and the loved ones, some who are coming from very far away. “Our final focus is doing everything that we can to preserve evidence and to conduct the recovery operation in manner that allows us to fully and professionally investigate this incident so that we can get to the bottom of how this happened. ” Schaaf said the city has “activated the criminal investigation team” which includes staff from the district attorney’s office, but said she would not speculate about causes of the fire or what exactly the city knew about the property, which had a record of complaints and was under investigation before the fire.  “It is far too early for us to have any suspicions about what actually caused this fire,” she said. Police and fire crews will continue “a   recovery operation” she added. “The scope of this tragedy is tremendous. ” “This tragedy has hit very close to home,” Kelly said, adding that one of the sheriff’s deputies lost his son in the fire. “We’re finding victims where we least expect them. ” Authorities did not immediately identify any victims, though most were believed to have been in their 20s and 30s. Kelly said that the dead include teenagers, and that some were foreign citizens. Melanie Ditzenerger urged people who are missing loved ones to “preserve any   of equipment” such as combs and brushes, in case officials cannot quickly identify a victim.    Earlier on Sunday, an unofficial list of those unaccounted for, compiled by friends and family searching for loved ones, still showed about 30 names. Kelly said that police still do not have a clear estimate about how many people were at the warehouse when the fire broke out. At a morning press briefing, Kelly said: “In regards to the amount of people that are still missing, yes, it’s a significant number. ” Kelly told reporters teams had worked through the night, with a crane and floodlights, to reach bodies on the second floor of the warehouse. Officials said there were only two exits from the second floor, and no evidence of smoke detectors or sprinklers. Kelly added that there are trailers within the warehouse, where people may have been living, that crews have not been able to search yet. Firefighters searched the debris “bucket by bucket” fire battalion chief Melinda Drayton said. “It was quiet, it was heartbreaking,” she added. “This will be a long and arduous process. ” The fire began at about 11. 30pm on Friday, blazing for hours and trapping people within the warehouse, which was known locally as “the Ghost Ship”.  Officials said that they did not yet know the cause of the fire, and that there may have been as many as 50 to 100 people in the building when it began. The warehouse had a history of safety code violations, city records showed, and a former resident told the Guardian that she had reported it to a fire marshal in 2014.  For years, the building had housed art studios and makeshift residences. The former resident said inside was a maze of fire hazards: a staircase made of wooden pallets, old pianos and couches, trinkets, furniture and ramshackle   shelters. The building lacked permits for housing, work or as a party venue. The city had received complaints about blight and opened an investigation into whether there was illegal construction within the warehouse.  An inspector had failed to gain access before the fire, said Oakland’s building and planning chief, Darin Ranalletti."
106748,157561,Leaked map reveals chronic mercury epidemic in Peru,Guardian,David Hill,2016-11-19,2016.0,11.0,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2016/nov/19/leaked-map-reveals-chronic-mercury-epidemic-in-perus-amazon,"Ask about the fish in restaurants in the centre of Puerto Maldonado, the biggest town in Peru’s   Amazon, and you’ll hear all kinds of things. Some people will shake their heads and say there isn’t any fish on the menu “because of the contamination” or “out of protocol”. Others might say there is fish available, before sometimes hastily clarifying that it comes from farms along the   Highway running to Brazil, or from the Pacific coast, or even, according to one chef, all the way from Vietnam. Why such problems with the fish in this part of the Amazon? Answer: alluvial gold and the mercury required to extract it. The   in the 8. 5m hectare Madre de Dios region began in the 1980s and, by 2012, miners had destroyed more than 50, 000 hectares of forest, effectively dumping 100s of tons of mercury into the rivers while doing so. In May this year Peru’s outgoing government announced a pathetic   “declaration of emergency”. An image of a unpublished map obtained by the Guardian, based on “preliminary results” from studies of local inhabitants by the Duke Global Health Institute in the US, provides some idea of how   and severe the mercury contamination is across Madre de Dios. Arguably the map’s most alarming revelation is that the most contaminated area of all is upstream from the mining: the stretch of the River Madre de Dios between towns called Boca Colorado and Boca Manu, a significant part of which is in the buffer zone of the Manu national park, which Unesco calls the most biodiverse place on earth. “It is noteworthy that some areas with high averages of mercury are upriver from the mining zones,” states the map, which was shown to Health Ministry officials earlier this year. The map suggests the second   area is inside the Manu park itself, immediately upriver from Boca Manu, along the River Manu’s left bank. The right bank is affected too. William Pan, the study’s lead researcher, told the Guardian “we didn’t sample people in Manu national park” but explains the map on the basis that his teams have sampled several communities “along that bend of the river (Rio   Madre de Dios)” and “the map smoothing method creates a 10km buffer around the study sites and the exposure is extrapolated”. How come people upstream are the most contaminated? Or maybe the mercury there has little or nothing to do with gold? As acknowledged by a 2011 report by the Environment Ministry, titled   and Mercury Contamination in Madre de Dios: a   mercury stored naturally in Amazon soil and vegetation is released when the forest is cut down or burnt and then leaches into the water.  Pan describes the mercury levels recorded by Duke as “very high” and says Madre de Dios is experiencing a “chronic mercury epidemic. ” The contamination upstream was, he says, “the most surprising finding of our human Hg [mercury] assessment. ” “The communities near the confluence of Rio Manu and Rio Madre de Dios have the highest exposures in the region,” Pan told the Guardian. “When we tested fish, water and sediment, none of the values were high. So we were surprised when people were detected with high levels. We have several hypotheses that we are evaluating. ” According to Pan, those hypotheses are the people in that region migrate downriver to work in the mining, and that they are more dependent than the rest of Madre de Dios on local agriculture, fish and meat because there are no roads. Another is that “due to reliance on fish consumption, they are likely eat larger fish, which will have more Hg just naturally”. Pan says the map was “supposed to be confidential with the Ministry of Health” because it is “unpublished data and we have not fully analysed all the samples,” calling it “very crude” and far from final. He told the Guardian it is based on three distinct studies conducted between May 2014 and June 2016, and the final results will include samples from almost 72 sites. He says the Health Ministry has “real monetary constraints right now due to expenditures of the prior ministry”. Previous research by Pan and colleagues argued that mercury contamination is generating “significant health risks” for communities in Madre de Dios “hundreds of kilometres” downstream from the mining, particularly among children and indigenous people.  “Children living within the central portion of the [Madre de Dios] watershed cannot safely consume carnivorous fish without exceeding recommended international [mercury] body burdens,” stated an article by Pan et al in Environmental Science in January 2015. “Deforestation and mercury release are an immediate threat to both local and distant downstream communities, many of which do not benefit economically from [the mining]. ” The law announcing Peru’s declaration of emergency in May stated that many people in Madre de Dios have “higher than the maximum recommended limits” of mercury, which causes “serious, chronic and complex health problems, particularly in children and pregnant women. ” “[M]ercury contamination of the air, water, sediment and fish is the result of inadequate practices by illegal and informal   during the extraction and working of alluvial gold,” the law stated. “In addition, there are people located beyond the mining extraction zones that are at high risk of being contaminated with mercury because of the high levels of it detected in the environment and in certain fish species, especially Mota Punteada, which is part of the daily diet of Madre de Dios’s population. ” The social and environmental tragedy unfolding in Madre de Dios has been known about for many years: the Ministry of Environment dubbed it a “ ” five years ago, but the bomb was ticking long before that. Will Peru’s new government, led by president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, now take sincere, sustainable,   steps to address the problem   not just in the Boca Manu region, obviously, but across Madre de Dios and Peru’s Amazon as a whole? What steps can the government take to initiate a massive public health campaign and inform those who are contaminated, or are at risk, and provide access to treatment  —   and if it doesn’t have the funds do so, who can provide them? What forms of alternative employment can be created, so those who find themselves forced to mine and handle mercury have other options? What steps can those buying, selling, hoarding, working and wearing Peruvian gold take to ensure they stop contributing to the devastation of huge swathes of the Amazon and the contamination of 1, 000s of people living there? The World Health Organization calls mercury “one of the top ten chemicals or groups of chemicals of major public health concern” and states that human activity, including   and   power stations, is the “main cause of mercury releases. ”  Peru is one of the world’s biggest gold producers, with the main importers being Canada, India, Switzerland, the UK and the US. A report published in April by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime argued that 28% of all gold in Peru is illegal, with illegal   across Latin America increasingly controlled by drugs traffickers and “organized crime” groups. In January Peru ratified the Minamata Convention on Mercury, a   global treaty which commits parties to regulate artisanal and   mining, among other things, and states that “parties may cooperate with each other” to stop altogether the use of mercury or mercury compounds in such mining. Switzerland and the US have ratified the Convention too, but Canada, India and the UK haven’t. Peru’s Health Ministry did not respond to questions."
106950,157836,Nick Kyrgios pulls out of Rotterdam Open to play in NBA celebrity game,Guardian,Guardian sport,2016-10-19,2016.0,10.0,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/19/nick-kyrgios-pulls-out-rotterdam-open-nba-celebrity-game,"Nick Kyrgios has pulled out of the Rotterdam Open in February so he can play in the NBA   celebrity game instead, tournament director Richard Krajicek confirmed on Wednesday. Kyrgios was suspended for eight weeks on Monday for a perceived lack of effort during the Shanghai Masters last week. The Australian clashed with fans and the chair umpire, and walked off court in the middle of a point. The    had signed up to play in the tournament in Holland next year, but Krajicek said Kyrgios had been released from his contract so he can take part in the NBA’s   showpiece in New Orleans. “Kyrgios is a big NBA fan and the chance to be on the court with Michael Jordan is unique for him,” Kraijcek said in a statement. “We do not think it makes much sense to have him on our court if he is not 100% motivated. With a field which already includes [Stan] Wawrinka, [Rafael] Nadal, [Dominic] Thiem and [Robin] Haase, we think we have enough quality on show. ” “Kyrgios prefers his passion beyond his profession,” Krajicek added. “We wanted to hold him to his contract. You see what can happen when he is tired and [tennis] has little meaning, as in China. We do not want that. So we decided to terminate his contract. We want a top tennis player seen on the court. “If every week he is focused on tennis, he might be mentally burned out after six months. He needs an outlet. ” The ATP said it would consider reducing Kyrgios’s   penalty if he agreed to see a sports psychologist. However, if the ATP’s conditions are not met, Kyrgios will not be allowed to return to the court until the Australian Open in January. Kyrgios took part in a Twitter QA on Wednesday morning. When asked if he intended to meet with a psychologist, Kyrgios replied: “Probs not. ” The player posted a lengthy apology online after his behaviour in Shanghai, which came days after he won the Japan Open, the third and biggest title of his career. He said: “I, of course, know how important the fans are to the success of our sport and I personally love the interaction with fans in the many different cities throughout the world on the tennis circuit. I am someone who gives a huge amount of time to my fans because I love and value their support. Their energy is what motivates me to reach for the top of the game. I regret that my year is ending this way and that I will not have a chance to continue chasing the ATP Finals. ” Krajicek, who won Wimbledon in 1996, has added US Open champion Wawrinka to the Rotterdam field in place of Kyrgios."
107194,158201,Facebook and Microsoft to build private internet highway underwater,Guardian,Danny Yadron,2016-05-26,2016.0,5.0,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/26/facebook-microsoft-internet-cable-underwater,"Facebook and Microsoft are going underwater. The two technology companies announced on Thursday they are to install an undersea cable from the east coast of the US to Spain to help speed up their global internet services.  Fast connectivity is particularly important to Facebook, which wants to encourage users across the world to broadcast live video and meet in virtual reality. Both activities can consume vast amounts of bandwidth. The project marks yet another example where technology companies are assuming roles traditionally left to public utilities or the government, and until now undersea cables have traditionally been laid by telecommunications incumbents. Meanwhile, Google continues to expand Fiber, its   internet program, Amazon. com effectively is building its own postal service, Uber is attempting to replace regulated cab companies and Facebook is bringing wireless internet to Africa. The cable will travel from northern Virginia in the US, a major junction point in the global internet, to Bilbao in Spain, and then onward to the rest of Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The companies said it will be   undersea cable yet across the Atlantic. The cost wasn’t disclosed.  An   subsidiary of Telefónica, the Spanish telecom provider, will manage the cable. Construction is scheduled to begin in August 2016 and be completed by October 2017.  Even though Telefónica will sell access to the cable to other companies, Facebook and Microsoft are ensuring they will get premier access to quick data transfers across the sea. In effect, the companies will have their own private highway between two major markets.  There currently are more than a dozen undersea cables between America and Europe.  The decision for Facebook and Microsoft to build their own speaks to their vision for how much bandwidth they will need in the future. At Facebook’s developer conference in San Francisco in April, executives showed how they envision two users on different continents meeting up virtually online using elaborate systems of headsets, cameras and other monitors. The experience will require an extraordinary amount of space on the internet’s backbone. Facebook’s ability to fund its own cable now is likely to help it maintain its market dominance in the future. While upstart virtual reality companies will have to buy space on others’ undersea cables, Facebook simply will have its own. "
107716,161184,Wife Of Orlando Nightclub Shooter Pleads Not Guilty To Charges Of Aiding Attack,NPR,Rebecca Hersher,2017-01-19,2017.0,1.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/01/19/510560674/wife-of-orlando-nightclub-shooter-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges-of-aiding-attack,"Noor Salman, the wife of the man who killed 49 people last June at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. has pleaded not guilty to two federal charges. Salman was arrested earlier this week and charged with providing material support to a terrorist and obstruction of justice for allegedly knowing about Omar Mateen’s plan to slaughter people at the nightclub. It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U. S. history. Mateen was killed by police. Salman married Mateen in 2011, as The   has reported. She grew up in California and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area after her husband’s death. She entered her plea of not guilty before a federal judge in Oakland. ”[Salman] was represented by a local attorney for Wednesday’s hearing but eventually will hire Charles Swift, a Texas lawyer from the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America,” reported the Orlando Sentinel. ”[Swift] must first get permission to practice law in California.” In November, Salman told The New York Times she was ”unaware of everything,” saying, ”I don’t condone what he has done. I am very sorry for what has happened. He has hurt a lot of people.” She also told the Times that Mateen had abused her. Salman’s childhood neighbors, described her to The Associated Press as ”a sweet, pretty California girl with Palestinian roots” who grew up in the suburbs and met Mateen online, as we have reported. In the days after the attack, the information Salman told investigators sometimes seemed contradictory. NPR’s Dina   reported Salman ”said she didn’t know that the attack was coming, but also told authorities that she tried to talk [Mateen] out of the attack.” Dina also reported that Salman told investigators she was with Mateen when he bought ammunition the week before the massacre, and joined her husband at the Pulse club before the attack. But Dina pointed out ”it’s possible she didn’t know that he was there to case the place.”"
108111,161673,Fact Checking This Week In The Trump Administration,NPR,Jessica Taylor,2017-02-04,2017.0,2.0,http://www.npr.org/2017/02/04/513348780/fact-checking-this-week-in-the-trump-administration,"It’s only the second week of the Trump administration, but there has been a continued tension with facts. In his first week, the president boasted about his inaugural crowds and doubled down on false claims that there were millions of illegal voters who swayed the results of the popular vote. This week, the White House pushed back on claims about the immigration and travel ban the president signed an adviser used a Kentucky massacre that never occurred to make an argument the press secretary thundered over ( )”identical” National Security Councils and the president referred to refugees as ”illegal immigrants” and kept touting the size of his electoral win, including support from black voters and Latinos.  1. ”It really is a massive success story in terms of implementation on every single level.”  —   senior administration official Sunday on the   ban and its implementation, Scenes at major international U. S. airports in the U. S. showed the implementation of the order rocky. There was confusion about whether it applied to green card holders and U. S. legal residents. A    boy was detained for hours. More than a dozen congressional Republicans broke ranks and criticized the rollout of the order, even Trump allies. ”We all share a desire to protect the American people, but this executive order has been poorly implemented, especially with respect to   holders,” Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker,  . said in a statement. Some agencies or officials who would be tasked with implementing it weren’t briefed with sufficient time before the order was signed. Trump defended that in a tweet saying he didn’t want to give bad dudes a heads up: 2. ”These seven countries, what about the 46   countries that are not included. Right there, it totally undercuts this nonsense that this is a Muslim ban.”  —   White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Fox News Sunday, It’s true that the words Muslim or Christian never appear in the executive order. And it’s true that it doesn’t ban all Muslims around the world. But the order does effectively ban Muslims from seven   countries and prioritizes Christians (and conceivably other religious minorities). Trump himself in December 2015 called for ”a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.” Trump supporter and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Fox News on Sunday that Trump originally wanted a Muslim ban but asked how to do it legally so it became about dangerous countries instead of religion. ”When he first announced it,” Giuliani said, ”he said, ’Muslim ban.’ He called me up, he said, ’Put a commission together, show me the right way to do it  —   legally.’ ” Trump himself stressed in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Christians would get special priority. The countries on the list are not just   they are all almost entirely Muslim, as the Boston Globe’s Matt Viser pointed out: 3. ”My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror.”  —   President Trump, in a statement on Facebook defending his policy, The Trump administration defended its choice of the seven countries by pointing out that the Obama administration had identified them as ”countries of concern,” but unlike Trump’s order, Obama’s did not bar people from entering the U. S. The Obama change stemmed from two Iraqis who were arrested in Kentucky (more on that later in the week). Their fingerprints were found in Iraq on an improvised explosive device targeting Americans. That caused the Obama administration to slow down the process of admitting Iraqis, but it never stopped it. 4. ”I mean New York Times has called me wrong from the beginning. They actually apologized to their readers. They lost a lot of subscriptions because  —   not because the readers even like me. They say ’how inaccurate could you be?’ ”  —   Trump, in an interview with Christian Broadcasting Network on Sunday, Trump has made similar claims about the Times ”apologizing” before, but such claims continue to not be true. As we recently wrote in a fact check about a Trump tweet: ”New York Times Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and Executive Editor Dean Baquet did write a letter to readers after the surprising election conclusion examining the paper’s coverage. In the note, they acknowledged that ’after such an erratic and unpredictable election there are inevitable questions: Did Donald Trump’s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?’ And a column from the paper’s public editor (or ombudsman) Liz Spayd, pointed out problems with its   vertical that predicted that Hillary Clinton had an 80 percent chance of winning the election. She also argued that the paper’s reporters could have done a better job of tapping into ’the sentiments of Trump supporters.’ ” However, neither of those pieces constitutes an apology. 5. ”And we did better with the Latino community. . .. Better than Romney, better than just about for a long way.”  —   Trump to CBN, Sunday, Trump received 28 percent of the Latino vote, according to 2016 exit poll data compiled by CNN. Romney received 27 percent of the Latino vote in 2012. The margin of error on each of those polls is plus or minus 3 percentage points, according to Edison Research, the organization that conducted the polls. As far as performing better with Hispanics than past candidates, that’s not really true, either. John McCain received 31 percent of the Latino vote in 2008, and in 2004, George W. Bush received 44 percent of the Latino vote  —   a figure that is often pointed to as a   mark for Republicans with that demographic. 6. ”And the   I got 84 percent of that vote. And they voted in big numbers.”  —   Trump to CBN, Sunday, It’s not clear where Trump got this number. It’s true that   tend to be more conservative than other Latino voters. But at least in the state with by far the most   the Trump share of the vote wasn’t nearly this high. According to the Pew Research Center, just over half (54 percent) of   in Florida  —   home to   of all   eligible voters  —   voted for Trump. In fact,   voters have grown less Republican over the years. According to Pew, nearly   of   were Republican or   as of 2002. As of 2013, it was just 47 percent. NPR has reached out to the White House for a source on this figure but did not receive a response. 7. The president tweeted blame at Delta Airlines on Monday. But while Delta did experience an outage that affected many flights on the ground, that problem was reported on Sunday night. Those delays began well after protests started breaking out at airports across the country on Saturday in response to Trump’s executive order on refugees, which was issued on Friday. 8. ”The Principals Committee is merely the NSC minus the president. The idea is that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the DNI are being downgraded or removed is utter nonsense.”  —   Spicer on Monday, The Principals Committee under George W. Bush, whom Spicer referenced in his briefing, indeed did not specifically include the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the director of national intelligence (or, at the time, the director of central intelligence, as the DNI did not exist yet). Rather, the Principals Committee said that the DCI and chairman would ”attend where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise” were going to be discussed, as NPR’s Domenico Montanaro pointed out in a fact check this week. However, the DNI and chairman were regular members under the Obama administration, according to one February 2009 memo. Here is the text of that list: ”The NSC Principals Committee ( ) will continue to be the senior interagency forum for consideration of policy issues affecting national security, as it has been since 1989. The National Security Advisor shall serve as Chair, and its regular members will be the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations, the Chief of Staff to the President, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.” The latest action from the White House is clearly different, moving the DNI and chairman back to attendees only at certain meetings: ”The PC shall have as its regular attendees the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, the Assistant to the President and Chief Strategist, the National Security Advisor, and the Homeland Security Advisor. The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall attend where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed. The Counsel to the President, the Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may attend all PC meetings.” In addition, Stephen Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, is now a regular attendee of the Principals Committee. That is one big way in which Trump’s NSC really is not like Obama’s or Bush’s. 9. ”He’s aware of what people have been saying. But I think, by and large, he’s been praised for it.”  —   Spicer at Monday’s press briefing, referring to the White House Holocaust Remembrance Statement that left out any mention of the Jewish people, Only white nationalists were celebrating the carefully parsed statement, with controversial   leader Richard Spencer praising it as the ”  of the Holocaust.” According to Politico, the White House even nixed a State Department statement that did mention Jewish victims. White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks defended the wording of the original statement, noting that while 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, 5 million others were also killed, including ”priests, gypsies, people with mental or physical disabilities, communists, trade unionists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, anarchists, Poles and other Slavic peoples, and resistance fighters.” That is true, but the express purpose of the Holocaust was to exterminate the Jewish people, and minimizing that has been the goal of Holocaust deniers, white nationalists and  . The Holocaust Memorial Museum criticized the statement, noting that ”Millions of other innocent civilians were persecuted and murdered by the Nazis, but the elimination of Jews was central to Nazi policy.” The Republican Jewish Coalition (which is heavily backed by GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson) also called out the wording, saying, ”The lack of a direct statement about the suffering of the Jewish people during the Holocaust was an unfortunate omission. History unambiguously shows the purpose of the Nazis’ final solution was the extermination of the Jews of Europe. We hope, going forward, he conveys those feelings when speaking about the Holocaust.” 10. ”It’s not a Muslim ban. It’s not a travel ban. It’s a vetting system to keep America safe.”  —   Spicer briefing, Tuesday, Several administration officials  —   including Spicer  —   called this a travel ban, as this CNN video shows. President Trump himself tweeted that it was a ban, though Spicer claimed that was because ”he’s using he words that the media is using.” In a tweet one day after Spicer tried to make this factually inaccurate defense, Trump again called it a ban. 11. ”If you remember I wasn’t going to do well with the   community, and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things, we ended up getting  —   and I won’t go into details  —   but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years.”  —   Trump remarks at an African American History Month listening session, Wednesday, Trump received 8 percent of the   vote in 2016, compared with the 6 percent received by Mitt Romney in 2012 and the 4 percent received by McCain in 2008. So he registered better numbers with   than the past two Republican candidates. However, George W. Bush received the support of 11 percent of   in 2004 and 9 percent in 2000. So Trump isn’t right here. Given margins of error, Trump performed roughly as well as the last handful of Republican candidates with   voters  —   perhaps better than Obama’s opponents did, but nothing out of the ordinary. 12. Trump tweeted of ”thousands of illegal immigrants” that the Obama administration agreed to take in from Australia. But, as we explained over at our Tweet annotator, they are neither ”thousands” nor ”illegal immigrants.” There are about 1, 250 people, who are seeking asylum  —   refugees who have fled their home countries seeking safety  —   many of whom are children. NPR’s   blog has more. 13. ”It’s hard to ever call something a complete success, when you have the loss of life or people injured, but I think when you look at the totality of what was gained to prevent the future loss of life . .. it is a successful operation by all standards.”  —   Spicer on Thursday, That is starkly different from the way the New York Times described it the day before. ”As it turned out,” Eric Schmitt and David Sanger wrote, ”almost everything that could go wrong did.” CENTCOM said the U. S. recovered information helpful to counterterrorism analysts. Spicer said the operation yielded valuable intelligence about   in the Arabian Peninsula. But NPR’s Alice Fordham and Tom Bowman reported that ”local witnesses disputed that, saying the special operations troops never entered any buildings to take any computers or documents.” NPR: ”The U. S. military has opened an investigation, and U. S. military officials tell NPR that civilians were indeed among the victims. Taken together, claims and counterclaims from the U. S. military and local residents described a chaotic operation, one that drew sharp criticism from Yemeni officials who usually support the U. S. The aftermath of the raid shows the potential dangers if the U. S. military relaxes its current restrictions about using force and protecting civilians, which President Trump has asked the Pentagon to review.” The Times: ”The death of Chief Petty Officer William Owens came after a chain of mishaps and misjudgments that plunged the elite commandos into a ferocious   firefight that also left three others wounded and a $75 million aircraft deliberately destroyed. There are allegations  —   which the Pentagon acknowledged on Wednesday night are most likely correct  —   that the mission also killed several civilians, including some children. . .. ”[T]he mission’s casualties raise doubts about the months of detailed planning that went into the operation during the Obama administration and whether the right questions were raised before its approval. Typically, the president’s advisers lay out the risks, but Pentagon officials declined to characterize any discussions with Mr. Trump.” 14. ”I bet, there was very little coverage  —   I bet it’s   information to people that President Obama had a   ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized  —   and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. I mean, most people don’t know that because it didn’t get covered.”  —   Conway on MSNBC’s Hardball, Thursday. There was no ”Bowling Green massacre” at all, and Conway has acknowledged she misspoke. She asked for ”grace” for the mistake. Conway was referring to the two Iraqi refugees referenced in Point 3. But neither had planned or executed an attack in Kentucky. Conway’s further assertion that President Obama had a   ban on Iraqi refugees is also false. The White House slowed down the approval process but did not halt it altogether. (In her tweet, she also notes something repeatedly used by Trump and others in the administration  —   a mistake a Time reporter made, reporting that a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. He quickly corrected the mistake.) NPR’s Sarah McCammon and Domenico Montanaro contributed to this report. "
108326,161981,"10 Hasty Takeaways From Grammy Night, Starting With Adele",NPR,Stephen Thompson,2017-02-13,2017.0,2.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2017/02/13/514918655/10-hasty-takeaways-from-grammy-night-starting-with-adele,"My Twitter feed is still roiling. As I write this, it’s been mere moments since my friends and colleagues (and a few assorted celebrities) started taking a break from praising the 2017 Grammys’ most vital and viral performances  —   A Tribe Called Quest, Beyoncé, The Time, a bonkers Lady   mashup  —   to fume about Adele’s sweep of the night’s top three prizes. The pop star won Album Of The Year for 25, as well as Song Of The Year and Record Of The Year for ”Hello,” and filled the night’s final speech with notes of regret that she’d just beaten Beyoncé (of all people) in all three categories. As we soak up the rich, creamy silence that follows the end of every awards show, here are 10   takeaways from the 2017 Grammy Awards. (We’ll post a Pop Culture Happy Hour Small Batch discussion by midday tomorrow look for it on this page or in your podcast feed.) 1) There’s much to unpack in Adele’s speech, but among other things, I think she understands the degree to which history will not be kind to that Album Of The Year win. While nowhere near as controversial as Macklemore sweeping Kendrick Lamar a few years back  —   25 is highly regarded, and ”Hello” has been a juggernaut for 16 months now  —   Lemonade is far more ambitious, tells a richer story, and retains greater relevance in the cultural conversation. Adele knows she beat a classic album, and to her credit, she devoted much of her final speech to acknowledging as such. 2) Compared to other recent awards shows  —   most notably the Golden Globes and the SAG Awards  —   the politics were surprisingly muted Sunday night. Paris Jackson shouted out the #NoDAPL protesters and Katy Perry said a few unkind words about Donald Trump, but only one performance really sustained a tone of resistance: a furious medley by A Tribe Called Quest, Anderson . Paak and Busta Rhymes. 3) Though nowhere near as thematically bold, Lady Gaga and Metallica paired up for an enjoyably intense hot mess of a performance  —   James Hetfield’s mic went out early, robbing him of his first couple verses  —   that seemed engineered to produce what the show likes to call a ”Grammy Moment.” Compared to some of the night’s waterier performances, it was a welcome jolt. 4) Speaking of wateriness, Lukas Graham (whose ”7 Years” was heavily nominated) and Kelsea Ballerini (who lost Best New Artist to Chance The Rapper) drew arguably the evening’s least desirable time slot: the moments before Beyonce presided over a grand,   set in which she performed ”Love Drought” and ”Sandcastles.” Visibly pregnant with twins, Queen Bey needed about five seconds to extinguish any and all memories of what had come before it. 5) It was hard for most nominees to stake out much space to shine, given the degree to which Adele and Beyonce dominated the proceedings. The two not only won multiple Grammys on Sunday  —   Beyonce took Best Urban Contemporary Album and Best Music Video for ”Formation”  —   but their performances also sparked some of the most conversation. Adele performed twice Sunday evening, opening the telecast with ”Hello” and later paying tribute to George Michael with a take on ”Fastlove” that needed to be aborted and started over. (Visibly flustered, Adele quickly apologized the crowd’s reaction could best be summed up as, ”Dude, you’re Adele. Do whatever. ”) 6) Though he couldn’t topple Adele for Album Of The Year, Sturgill Simpson had a nice night, winning Best Country Album and making a fine appearance alongside The   who pop up several times on his A Sailor’s Guide To Earth. The set even kicked off with a nice little momentary tribute to Sharon Jones, one of the many amazing musicians who’d died since the 2016 telecast. 7) Bafflingly, Merle Haggard didn’t fare nearly as well country performances dotted the evening, yet the late legend received only a single mention, during the ”In Memoriam” montage. (Over his name, producers played ”Okie From Muskogee,” a song about which Haggard was publicly ambivalent.) 8) Chance The Rapper won big: He took home the   Grammy for a   album, winning Best Rap Album (for Coloring Book) Best Rap Performance (”No Problem”) and Best New Artist (for which he beat out The Chainsmokers, Anderson . Paak, Kelsea Ballerini and Maren Morris). As a bonus, Chance gave one of the night’s most riveting performances: a medley of ”How Great” and ”All We Got” that featured a guest appearance by gospel giant Kirk Franklin, among others. 9) The night’s tributes to Prince yielded the monumentally welcome return of The Time, who performed ”Jungle Love” and ”The Bird”  —   both of which Prince cowrote  —   before giving way to a take on ”Let’s Go Crazy” by Bruno Mars. Mars had the star power, sure, but if one young person googles ”the time jungle love” tonight, the entire evening will have been worth it. Teach the children well, people. 10) Finally, the members of Twenty One Pilots accepted their award for Best Pop   Performance  —   for the ubiquitous ”Stressed Out”  —   by stripping down to their underpants before taking the stage. This may or may not have actually happened. I’m pretty tired."
109662,163656,How U.S. Health Care Became Big Business,NPR,Terry Gross,2017-04-10,2017.0,4.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/04/10/523005353/how-u-s-health-care-became-big-business,"Health care is a   industry in America, but are we getting what we pay for? Dr. Elisabeth Rosenthal, a medical journalist who formerly worked as a medical doctor, warns that the existing system too often focuses on financial incentives over health or science. ”We’ve trusted a lot of our health care to   businesses and it’s their job, frankly, to make profit,” Rosenthal says. ”You can’t expect them to act like Mother Teresas.” Rosenthal’s new book, An American Sickness, examines the deeply rooted problems of the existing   system and also offers suggestions for a way forward. She notes that under the current system, it’s far more lucrative to provide a lifetime of treatments than a cure. ”One expert in the book joked to me . .. that if we relied on the current medical market to deal with polio, we would never have a polio vaccine,” Rosenthal says. ”Instead we would have iron lungs in seven colors with iPhone apps.” On what consolidation of hospitals is doing to the price of care  In the beginning, this was a good idea: Hospitals came together to share efficiencies. You didn’t need every hospital ordering bed sheets. You didn’t need every hospital doing every procedure. You could share records of patients so the patient could go to the medical center that was most appropriate. Now that consolidation trend has kind of snowballed and skyrocketed to a point . .. that in many parts of the country, major cities only have one, maybe two, hospital systems. And what you see with that level of consolidation is it’s kind of a  . What happens, of course, when you have a   is you have an enormous sway over price. And so, what we see in research over and over again is that the cities that have the most hospital consolidation tend to have the highest prices for health care without any benefit for patient results. So consolidation, which started as a good idea in many places, has evolved to a point where it’s not benefiting patients anymore, it is benefiting profits. On the ways the   industry stands to profit more from lifetime treatment than it does from curing disease, If you’re a pharmaceutical manufacturer and you have a problem like diabetes, for example, if I invented a pill tomorrow that would cure diabetes  ” that would kill a   dollar business market. It’s far better to have treatments, sometimes really great treatments . .. [that] go on for life. That’s much better than something that will make the disease go away overnight. On how prices will rise to whatever the market will bear, Another concept that I think is unique to medicine is what economists call ”sticky pricing,” which is a wonderful term. It basically means . .. once one drugmaker, one hospital, one doctor says ”Hey we could charge $10, 000 for that procedure or that medicine.” Maybe it was $5, 000 two months ago, but once everyone sees that someone’s getting away with charging $10, 000, the prices all go up to that sticky ceiling. . .. What you see often now is when generic drugs come out . .. the price doesn’t go down to 20 percent of the branded price, it maybe goes down to 90 percent of the branded price. So we’re not getting what we should get from a really competitive market where we, the consumers, are making those choices. On initiating conversations early on with doctors about fees and medical bills  You should start every conversation with a doctor’s office by asking ”Is there a concierge fee? Are they affiliated with a hospital? Which hospital are they affiliated with? Is the office considered part of a hospital?” In which case you’re going to be facing hospital fees in addition to your doctor’s office fees. You ask your doctor always . .. ”If I need a lab test, if I need an   will you send me to an   provider so I don’t get hit by    fees?” . .. Often that will be a little hard for your doctor, because they may have to fill out a different requisition, but it’s worth asking. And any doctor who won’t help you in that way, I think, isn’t attuned to the financial cost that we’re bearing today. On getting charged for ”  doctors” brought in by the hospital or primary doctor  You do have to say ”Who are you? Who called you?” and ”Am I going to be billed for this?” And it’s tragic that in recovery people have to think in this kind of     somewhat adversarial way, but I think if we don’t push back against the system in the way it bills, we’re complicit in allowing it to continue. On how to decipher coded medical bills  Don’t be alarmed by the ”prompt payment discount.” Go back to the hospital and say, ”I want a fully itemized bill. I want to know what I’m paying for.” Some of it will be in codes, some of it will be in medical abbreviations. I’ve discovered you can Google those codes and find out what you’re being charged for, often, and most importantly, you might find you’re being charged for stuff that obviously you know you didn’t have.

109713,163710,"On The Navajo Nation, Special Ed Students Await Water That Doesn’t Stink",NPR,Laurel Morales,2017-04-12,2017.0,4.0,http://www.npr.org/2017/04/12/523303559/on-the-navajo-nation-special-ed-students-await-water-thats-doesnt-stink,"On the Navajo Nation, kids with the most severe developmental disabilities attend a school called Saint Michael’s Association for Special Education. Dameon David, 8, is waking up from a nap in his classroom. He has come to the school in northeastern Arizona for four years. He has cerebral palsy, seizures and scoliosis. His mom, Felencia Woodie, picks him up from a bed with Superman sheets. ”Other schools that he was going to go to, they didn’t have the nursing staff or the equipment he goes in, or the trained staff that they have here to do his suctioning, his feeding and his medications daily,” she says. Woodie, who also works at Saint Michael’s, says the only problem with the school is its water. ”It has a certain stench to it. Sometimes you’ll smell . .. kinda like a egg smell,” Woodie says. ”Sometimes it’s yellow, brown, or even we’ve seen black.” Many of the kids at Saint Michael’s are medically fragile. So they have equipment that needs to be cleaned daily. The staff refuses to use the tap water to wash equipment. Instead, they use   jugs of filtered water trucked in from many miles away. More than   of the Navajo Nation  —   which is the size of West Virginia  —   doesn’t have running water. And at some of the places that do, like Saint Michael’s, people don’t want to drink it because it smells, tastes funny and looks bad. In another classroom, volunteer Jacob Lundy helps two young girls with autism wash their hands at the sink. The water runs yellow. ”What’s odd to me is how normal it becomes for the water in the laundry room to come out black,” Lundy says. ”And it’s just like we don’t think about it anymore.” In the sink you can see the residue from the black water. It looks like sand. Gregory Bahe, water and waste water operations supervisor at the utility, says the strange color, smell and taste are all likely due to stagnant water. He says the water lines are so far apart that the water sits stagnant for long periods. The Navajo Tribal Utility Authority tests the water at Saint Michael’s monthly and says it meets national primary drinking water standards. While it’s not poisonous, there is still the matter of appearance. ”People typically won’t drink water if it tastes bad or if it looks bad or if it stinks,” says Adam Bringhurst, who studies water resources at Northern Arizona University. He says the Environmental Protection Agency has established two levels of standards. The primary standard  —   filtering contaminants that harm your health  —   is required by law. The secondary standard  —   eliminating taste, color and smell  —   is voluntary. ”The secondary standards are typically considered aesthetics,” Bringhurst says. But those secondary standards are still very important, he says. ”We all need to drink water. And when your only option is to go to the store and pay really high prices, that also carry a really big footprint with them, it’s a bad situation for everyone,” Bringhurst says. Saint Michael’s spent almost $3, 000 last year on bottled water alone. That’s a big cost for a school with so many expenses and one that a better water filtration system could alleviate. So a school volunteer contacted Dig Deep, a nonprofit that digs wells and makes water accessible throughout the region. George McGraw, Dig Deep’s founder and executive director, is especially concerned for the disabled kids. ”These are people that rely on us, on their teachers, on their government officials, on society at large, to make sure that their most basic needs are taken care of. And what’s more basic than having access to clean running water?” McGraw says. The organization is raising $100, 000 to build a water filtration system for Saint Michael’s. It hopes to install it this summer so the water is more than just technically safe. It will be something kids and staff actually want to drink.

110285,164421,"Don’t Count On The Senate To Save Obamacare, Or To Save The House",NPR,Ron Elving,2017-05-07,2017.0,5.0,http://www.npr.org/2017/05/07/527127968/dont-count-on-the-senate-to-save-obamacare-or-to-save-the-house,"In the Rose Garden last week President Trump and the House Republican leadership celebrated their vote to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act as though it had actually repealed and replaced the 2010 law colloquially known as Obamacare. It had not, of course. Several more giant steps remain in the process. And more than a few of these same Republicans may well be grateful. The House, its leaders and    alike know that what they have done so far is not yet law. It may not even qualify as a rough draft. In reality, the House has shoveled a mammoth pile of problems off its porch and onto that of the U. S. Senate. That chamber has announced it is writing its own bill. That is common knowledge, and more than a few House votes were cajoled with assurances that ”the Senate will fix” this problem or that. For those concerned about the policy itself, the prospect of the Senate taking over was a mixed bag. Would they make it better in fact? Such debates aside, most of the House members were asking: Would the Senate make it less explosive politically? Most seemed to believe the Senate would take the pressure off the House in the short run. And just maybe, with luck, it might take the onus off the House in the long run as well. Here’s how it works: If both House and Senate pass their own separate bills, there will be a conference committee that strives to ”compose their differences.” (This might take weeks.) The report on this hybrid must then pass a revote in both chambers in identical form, as the Constitution demands. So whatever happens now, the House folks figure the spotlight is shifting to the Senate. And it ought to stay there. Option One: The Senate can fail to pass anything at all. Then the whole enterprise dies on their doorstep, just as it seemed likely to do on the House’s doorstep last week. Option Two: The Senate can also pass something that is so wildly different from the House bill that the conference cannot produce a hybrid of the two. That too could be blamed on the Senate. Like, hey, everything was fine when we did it in the House back in May didn’t you see that celebration in the Rose Garden? Option Three: The Senate can pass something and the conference committee can do its thing and then the Senate can refuse to approve the conference report. Senate at fault again. Option Four: If the conference report does pass the Senate, well maybe then the House can approve it and point a finger at the changes the Senate insisted on. Option Five: The Senate approves the conference compromise and it fails in the House.  . But, think again, this can be sold as the House playing Horatius at the Bridge  —   the valiant tribune of the people. Wouldn’t it be the Senate in this scenario that was guilty of ruining a perfectly good House product? (See reference to Rose Garden celebration above.) Any way you look at it, the House is better off with the ball in someone else’s court. In a way, this reliance on the Senate to save the day dovetails with the confidence in the Senate shown by Obamacare’s defenders. They have a litany of reasons to believe the Senate will not gut the Affordable Care Act (the law’s formal name and preferred by many). It begins with the close partisan division of the Senate, where Republicans have just 52 seats and so just two votes to spare. (Vice President Pence would be expected to break any tie in favor of the GOP.) If three or more Republicans turn against any version of the    bill in the Senate, the bill falls. Moreover, it is possible the Senate parliamentarian will limit how much of the legislation can be passed by simple majority. Matters in the bill that are not strictly    issues are not eligible for   votes, which are reserved for budgets and fiscal matters that the chamber needs to keep moving (without filibusters). Democrats in 2010 finished passing the ACA using these same   procedures for part of it  —   but not all. If Republicans need to move some elements of    by the usual procedure, they will need not 50 votes but 60. That would require perfect unity among the Republicans and at least eight Democratic crossovers. Right now that is extremely hard to imagine. Considering all this, and adding in the evident distaste of senators in both parties for what the House did, what chance does    have in the Senate? It might seem to be slim to none. But not so fast. All these difficulties are real, but none is insurmountable. The Senate is not the end of the line for    it’s just the graveyard for the House version just passed. The right kind of leadership, wily and shrewd and steeped in Senate   might just find a way to bring a few Democrats on board. And if you are looking for that kind of leadership, untrammeled by ideological purity or other forms of fuzzy thinking, you need look no further. I give you Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. It would require negotiating with those Democrats of course, it would require giving them something. And anything of value and substance might cost you some Republican votes. The calculus will need to be fine indeed. But, in the end, there will be enormous pressure from the history of the last eight years, from the expectations of the broader ranks of Republicans, from the donors and the volunteers and the true believers. They do not want to be told that Obamacare cannot be repealed. And do not underestimate the power of momentum, which is what the House just snatched back from the vanishing point. Do not underestimate what President Trump may be able to do in rallying support for whatever emerges as the party’s legislative product in the end. It may not matter at all what is in the actual bill. Trump on Thursday embraced the House’s       approach in the afternoon. In the evening, he told the Australian prime minister his country had a better health care system than the U. S.  —   and Australia has     health care for all. Given all these realities, it is possible the Senate could surprise us all with something that becomes The Bill, and that will then be The Only Way. And with the combined energy and will of the present Republican moment, that bill may be irresistible in conference and in the consideration of that conference’s report."
110762,165065,"In The Age Of Digital Medicine, The Humble Reflex Hammer Hangs On",NPR,Bret Stetka,2017-05-28,2017.0,5.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/05/28/529821714/in-the-age-of-digital-medicine-the-humble-reflex-hammer-hangs-on,"Receiving a diagnosis in 2017  —   at least one made at a medical center outfitted with the latest clinical gadgetry  —   might include a scan that divides your body into a bread loaf of   digital slices. Your DNA might be fed through a gene sequencer that spits out your mortal code in a matter of hours. Even your smartphone might soon be used to uncover health problems. Yet nearly 130 years since its inception  —   after decades of science has mapped out our neuronal pathways  —   a simple knob of rubber with a metal handle remains one of medicine’s most essential tools. I’m referring to the cheap, portable,    reflex hammer. This unassuming device can be invaluable in diagnosing nervous and muscular disorders, and in determining whether a patient’s pathology lies in the brain or elsewhere in the body. It can also help curtail health care spending by preventing unnecessary, often expensive testing. Yet like so many major medical and scientific discoveries, the reflex hammer has humble origins, in this case: the basement of a Viennese hotel. The inn was run by the father of Leopold Auenbrugger, an 18th century doctor who is considered to be among the founders of modern medicine. To gauge how much wine was left for customers, hotel employees would thump casks with their hands and listen for a dull thud or hollow tympany. Auenbrugger realized that the same technique  —   now called ”percussing”  —   could be applied to the human torso to, say, determine how much fluid had built up around a diseased heart. He wrote as much in his 1761 paper ”New invention to detect diseases hidden deep within the chest.” Relflex hammer warfare, Thought to be more accurate than the human hand, it wasn’t long before percussion hammers were being designed to more precisely diagnose disease. Competition ensued. Scottish physician Sir David Barry’s model, released in the 1820s, was the first. German doctor Max A. Wintrich’s came shortly after and was more popular, but was not without its critics: ”[Wintrich’s hammer] is inconvenient to hold, it is rigid . .. it required education to use it, and even then it does not fulfill its purposes,” a rival inventor commented. As neurologist Dr. Douglas J. Lanksa wrote in a 1989 paper   on the many types of reflex hammers, ”Some were   or   others resembled battle axes, tomahawks, or even magic wands.” He adds that no material was off limits: wood, ebony, whale bone, brass, lead, even ”  worsted” (a type of yarn). As percussion hammer warfare waged on, doctors and scientists were also beginning to understand the concept of reflexes, or involuntary,   responses to stimuli that occur before any sensory information reaches the brain. Muscular jerks. Blinking. Sneezing. Gagging. All of these are automatic feedback loops between sensory and motor neurons that help us navigate our environment and protect us from danger. In 1875, German neurologists Drs. Heinrich Erb and Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal were among the first to realize that eliciting a reflex by briskly tapping the tendons of major muscles might be useful. They felt the knee jerk  —   or ” ” reflex  —   in particular could help assess nerve function. Hammers specifically suited to test reflexes were soon developed, the first of which had the now classic shape we’re accustomed to  —   a thin metal handle with a triangular rubber head. Designed by American physician John Madison Taylor in Philadelphia in 1888  —   and modified ever since by many  —   the simple device was heavy enough to elicit reflexes, and had round edges to ease impact. An entry level model runs just $2. 25 on Amazon. The Krauss hammer, developed by   physician William Christopher Krauss, was designed around the same time. It had two rounded heads: a large one for knees and a smaller one for biceps. Dr. Ernst L. O. Trömner’s did too, but it also tapered to a thin end to assess skin reflexes. There were also the Queen Square hammer, the Babinski hammer, the Buck hammer and the Berliner hammer. The Stookey hammer flaunted a camel hair brush to get a better sense of touch sensation. The list goes on. Past to present, Daniella C. Sisniega is a third year medical student at the Boston University School of Medicine. Last month at the American Academy of Neurology’s annual meeting, she presented a poster explicating the reflex hammer’s past. ”I’m fascinated by how the reflex hammer started out as a percussion hammer, but was [then] adapted to elicit reflexes and has been in every neurologist’s tool box ever since,” she told NPR. ”I also did not know that the little rubber triangle was the first reflex hammer. I feel like I owe it an apology!” Sisniega jokes about the lackluster quality of the inexpensive Taylors. ”The little tomahawk is included in the kit everyone receives when they enter medical school,” she recalls. ”The rubber is cheap and very light, while the other hammers are heavier on the head so that you can use the ’swing’ of the hammer as opposed to the strength of the strike to test the reflex.” While attending the AAN conference myself, I asked multiple sclerosis expert Dr. Stephen Krieger about the role of the reflex hammer in modern medical diagnosis. ”We could argue about the nuances of the hammer  —   the Queens Square, the Tomahawk, plastic handle, metal handle, weighted, flexible or rigid  —   but the hammer itself is always in the hand. Reflexes tell the story of neurologic diseases of all sorts,” he says. Krieger explains how disorders of the brain, like a stroke or brain tumor, result in hyperactive reflexes, while conditions affecting muscles and peripheral nerves usually result in reduced or   reflexes. Reduced reflexes are, for example, a common symptom of back pain due to degenerative disk disease. Dr. Andrew Wilner, an assistant professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic, recounted the story of one of his patients, who had back pain, weakness and numbness of the legs. Wilner was leaning toward a diagnosis of either   Syndrome (GBS)  —   an autoimmune disorder of peripheral nerves  —   or a myelopathy, an injury of some kind to the spinal cord. Both conditions can lead to medical emergencies, but each requires drastically different treatment. ”The reflex hammer was arguably our most important tool in narrowing down the differential diagnosis,” he says. ”Had we found diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes, GBS would have been more likely. As it turned out, the patient had brisk pathological knee jerks, pointing to a lesion in the brain or spinal cord.” Based on these findings, Wilner ordered an imaging study of the patient’s spinal cord, where a lesion was found  —   as opposed to pursuing the costly tests involved in a GBS diagnosis. Wilner feels that the simple art of interviewing and examining a patient can get overshadowed by the myriad new diagnostic technologies. When it comes to clinical tools, he feels, sometimes basic is better. ”Technology is glorious,” admits Krieger, ”and [it] will teach us things about patients that we could never have known or imagined. But the simple, elegant, inexpensive almost plebeian swing of the reflex hammer has a   ratio that I think no advanced technology will likely ever match.” Bret Stetka is a writer based in New York and an editorial director at Medscape.

110883,165222,"In A First, Connecticut’s Animals Get Advocates In The Courtroom",NPR,Laurel Wamsley,2017-06-02,2017.0,6.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/02/531283235/in-a-first-connecticuts-animals-get-advocates-in-the-courtroom,"A Connecticut law makes it the first state to provide animals with   advocates to represent them in abuse and cruelty cases, similar to laws that provide for victim’s or children’s advocates. Seven lawyers and a law professor in the state are approved as volunteer advocates, the AP reports. Judges have discretion on whether to appoint an advocate defense attorneys and prosecutors may request them. This week University of Connecticut student Taylor Hansen was the first of the advocates to testify in court, in a dogfighting case, alongside the approved law professor, Jessica Rubin. The case involves three pit bulls, according to the AP: ”One emaciated dog with scars from fighting had been found wandering. The other two were found in a home filled with animal feces, rotting food and evidence of dogfighting. One animal had to be euthanized.” Hansen argued  —   unsuccessfully, in the end  —   that the man charged in the case should not be allowed to participate in a program for   offenders, in which his record would eventually be cleared. That outcome is one that has happened before, in the case for which Connecticut’s law is named. Desmond’s Law is named after ”a shelter dog that was starved, beaten and strangled to death” in 2012, according to the Hartford Courant. ”Despite a recommendation by the prosecutor for prison time, the man charged in the crime received accelerated rehabilitation, which meant that his charges were dismissed and his record was wiped clean.” ”The animal advocates are an official party to the case,” the AP explains. ”They can do investigative work prosecutors often don’t have time for, such as interviewing veterinarians and other witnesses. They also make arguments, write briefs and make recommendations to the judge.” Between 2006 and 2016, only a small portion  —   19 percent  —   of Connecticut’s 3, 723 animal abuse or cruelty cases ended in convictions, according to the wire service. One percent of the cases resulted in   verdicts, but the bulk  —   80 percent  —   of cases were dismissed or not prosecuted. Hansen, the advocate, found value in the process, even if the outcome wasn’t the one she had argued for. ”It showed the animals do have a voice,” she told the AP. ”We are able to have an impact on the proceedings.” Advocates like Hansen are part of the emerging field of animal law. According to the Animal Legal Defense Fund, nine law schools had courses in animal law in 2000 by 2015, that number was 151. That growth is due in part to a few   animal lovers. Former The Price Is Right host Bob Barker has donated $1 million to several law schools to create endowments for the study of   law. And last year philanthropist Jeff C. Thomas gave $1 million to Harvard Law School’s Animal Law  Policy Program with the goal of helping farm animals. Studies have found connections between animal abuse and violence against people. In one study cited by the Humane Society, the Chicago Police Department found that 65 percent of those arrested for animal crimes had also been arrested for battery against another person. Another study found that pet abuse was a significant risk factor for people inflicting violence against their intimate partners. ”We hope with this law in place, we will start to see much better procedural outcomes [in animal abuse cases],” Annie Hornish, Connecticut director for the Humane Society of the United States, told the AP. ”We are very excited that judges seem to be taking advantage of it.”"
111387,165864,Tupac Shakur Biopic ’All Eyez On Me’ Hit With Copyright Infringement Lawsuit,NPR,Andrew Flanagan,2017-06-23,2017.0,6.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2017/06/23/534122055/tupac-shakur-biopic-all-eyez-on-me-hit-with-copyright-infringement-lawsuit,"A week after opening to a tepid critical response and accusations of historical inaccuracies from actress Jada Pinkett Smith  —   as well as a misinterpreted Internet joke that had many searching in vain for the appearance of an iPhone in the film  —   the Tupac Shakur biopic All Eyez On Me has now been hit with a copyright infringement lawsuit. The suit  —   filed today by Kevin Powell, a longtime pop culture writer, author, activist  —   accuses the film’s executive producers, screenwriters and distributors of cribbing from three cover stories on Shakur that Powell wrote for Vibe during the height of Shakur’s career. [Disclosure: NPR Music published an article by Powell, a remembrance of the recently deceased rapper Prodigy, earlier today.] Powell addressed the suit on Facebook, writing: ”After viewing the movie twice in the past few days, it is clear that my exclusive Vibe cover stories on Tupac Shakur (when he was alive) were lifted, without proper credit or compensation of any kind to me.” The list of defendants includes executive producers James G. Robinson, L. T. Hutton, screenwriters Steven Bagatourian, Jeremy Haft and Eddie Gonzales, as well as Morgan Creek Productions, Lions Gate and Program Pictures. Director Benny Boom was not named in the suit. Powell is seeking a series of damages, including $180, 000 for each ”broadcast” of the film. Lions Gate and Morgan Creek were not immediately available for comment on the allegations. The three Vibe articles in question  —   ”Exclusive: Is Tupac Crazy or Just Misunderstood” ”Tupac Shakur Jailhouse Exclusive” ”Live from Deathrow”  —   were published in February 1994, April 1995 and February 1996, and offer a striking view into Shakur’s famously nuanced thinking during the most critical time of his career. Notably, the suit’s allegations rest, in part, on creations and embellishments that Powell placed in his Vibe articles. ”While some of the content in these articles was factual,” the complaint reads, ”some portions of the article were changed or embellished by Plaintiff . .. In fact, the name and character of ’Nigel’ in [the Vibe articles] was specifically created by the Plaintiff without the authority or encouragement of Tupac Shakur. This made up character of Nigel was the embellishment of a real life character that was central to the narrative in [Powell’s] articles.” It also claims as infringing the use in the film of ”metaphorical slang and strong language, including but limited to the liberal use of the   indicative of the way rappers in the 1990’s talk.” As The Hollywood Reporter points out, these admissions could be interpreted as a legal tactic that allows Powell to claim ownership over biographical facts. Powell’s attorney, Keith White, may have been   criticism of Powell on these points in a statement today, writing that ”Kevin took creative license to protect the complex human being that was Tupac Shakur. This included   narrative changes and character creation in an effort to protect the legacy that Tupac was still building. Kevin’s exclusive and intimate access to Tupac Shakur came as a result of the trust established over the years. The narrative that Kevin developed from many intense and exclusive moments with Tupac should not have been used in any film without Kevin’s approval and consultation.” Powell’s lawsuit caps a week of controversy for Benny Boom’s film, which grossed $31 million domestically in its opening weekend."
111604,166143,Armed Group Takes Over Federal Building Following Protest In Oregon ,NPR,Eyder Peralta,2016-01-03,2016.0,1.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/03/461818657/militia-takes-over-federal-building-following-protest-in-oregon,"A small group of armed   occupied the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Ore. on Saturday. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports that the men were apparently led by Ammon Bundy. He is the son of Cliven Bundy, who was involved in a   standoff with the federal government in Nevada over grazing rights. The day started off with a protest. Militia members marched in support of Dwight Hammond Jr. and his son, Steven Hammond, two ranchers who were convicted of setting federal lands on fire. OPB reports that as the sun set most of the hundreds of protesters left Burns but a group stayed to take over the refuge. OPB adds: ”A group of five men bundled in coats and scarves fed sagebrush branches into a campfire. Only Ammon spoke to the media, but a few of the men quietly identified themselves as longtime residents of the Burns area and supporters of the Hammonds. ”Asked how many militia members were at the headquarters, Bundy demurred. ’I will not disclose,’ he said. ’Operational security.’ . .. ”There was no sign of law enforcement near the entrance to the refuge, though an Oregon State Police patrol car idled by the side of the road just outside Burns. ” ’We are not hurting anybody or damaging any property. We would expect that they understand that we have given them no reason to use lethal force upon us or any other force,’ Bundy said.” On its Facebook page, the Bundy Ranch posted video of Ammon Bundy talking to the press: Bundy said the men were prepared to ”stay as long as it takes.” He said he wanted the federal government to end the restrictions it has placed on some federal lands. ”All comfort, all wealth . .. comes from the Earth, and we cannot have the government restricting the use of that to the point where it puts us in poverty,” Bundy said. OPB reports that the Hammonds plan to report to jail on Monday. They were sentenced to a year or less in prison in 2012 for arson. But federal prosecutors appealed that sentence, saying the two men should have ”received the mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison for burning federal property.” The government won that appeal in October, and the Hammonds were ordered to begin serving the rest of that   sentence on Monday. Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward told The Oregonian that multiple agencies are ”currently working on a solution” to the occupation. Update at 3:16 p. m. ET. Could Take Months:  During a press conference outside the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge building, Bundy said his group had a plan and that it could take ”several months at the shortest to accomplish.” Bundy said this was a fight about the Constitution. The federal government, he said, has no right over these lands unless the states cede those rights to them. It’s worth noting that the Constitution gives the federal government full power to do what it wishes with lands owned by the United States. (Also, if you’re interested in the history of federal land ownership, the Congressional Research Service has a quick primer.) Ultimately, Bundy concluded, this occupation is intended to give ranchers back rights they believe they possess. For example, the Hammonds’ cows should be able to move and graze through the refuge’s land as they wish. ”I will say this refuge from its very inception has been a tool of tyranny,” Bundy said."
111777,166332,Michigan Steps Up Efforts To Tackle Lead Crisis After Outcry,NPR,Merrit Kennedy,2016-01-11,2016.0,1.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/11/462688864/michigan-steps-up-efforts-to-tackle-lead-crisis-after-outcry,"Michigan officials are stepping up their efforts to address elevated lead levels in Flint’s water after residents accused them of responding too slowly to the crisis. Local officials are handing out water filters and jugs in the streets of Flint and have set up five new distribution centers for filters and testing kits. And as Michigan Radio reports, the coordinator of the state response to the crisis says ”social workers will make    visits to make sure homes have water filters correctly installed, and children are getting the services they need.” On Monday, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder formed a committee made up of experts ”to work on   solutions to the Flint water situation and ongoing public health concerns affecting residents.” The elevated lead levels are widely blamed on the city’s water supply, as we previously reported. In April 2014, the city switched to getting its water from the Flint River. The new supply corroded the city’s pipes, leaching lead into the tap water. Even though the city switched back to its original source, the Detroit water system, Flint’s mayor says city tap water is still dangerous. The latest efforts come as the governor faced ”a growing crescendo of criticism over the weekend on the state’s handling of the crisis,” Michigan Radio reports. Snyder declared a state of emergency in Flint on Jan. 5, which ”triggered activation of the state’s emergency response center.” As Michigan Radio points out, ”that’s months after the Snyder administration acknowledged lead contamination of the city’s drinking water in September.” ”State and city leaders had largely dismissed residents’ complaints for months, assuring them that the water was safe and being tested regularly,” The New York Times reported. The impact of lead poisoning is irreversible, as we reported last month. Here’s more: ”High levels of lead are especially harmful to children and pregnant women, and can cause ’learning disabilities, behavioral problems and mental retardation,’ the World Health Organization says. ”A study conducted by a local medical center released in September showed that 2. 1% of children 5 and under had elevated blood lead levels before the switch to Flint River water, compared to 4. 0% after the switch.” Flint’s newly elected Mayor Karen Weaver told Morning Edition last month that the city needs money and resources to address the crisis. ”You know, it’s an infrastructure crisis for us, so we know that’s going to be a tremendous cost and burden on the city of Flint that we can’t handle by ourselves.”"
111915,166485,"Decades Since His Death, MLK’s Shadow Still Shapes Today’s Activism",NPR,NPR Staff,2016-01-17,2016.0,1.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/01/17/463387671/decades-since-his-death-mlks-shadow-still-shapes-todays-activism,"The country remembers the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday. More than four decades after his death, many people see the Black Lives Matter movement as the modern incarnation of the drive for human dignity and legal standing that Dr. King embodied. But others, including members of an earlier generation of activists, find fault with the group, seeing it as an aimless, formless group that still lacks direction and  . Meanwhile, younger activists sometimes see their seniors as too narrow in their focus and rigid in their methods. Others ask whether the mere fact that another protest movement has arisen is a sign that earlier efforts have fallen short. To delve into King’s legacy in modern activism, NPR’s Michel Martin turned to the Rev. William Barber II and Patrisse Cullors, two prominent activists. Barber, president of the North Carolina NAACP, is best known for leading Moral Monday protests across the state in 2013. Cullors, an artist from Los Angeles, is considered one of the   of Black Lives Matter movement. On Martin Luther King Jr. ’s legacy, Cullors: Part of our work in this generation has been about reclaiming MLK, and the ways that this government, in a lot of ways, has totally whitewashed his legacy. As a young kid growing up, what we were given was the ”[I Have A] Dream” speech. We weren’t given his grassroots organizing, we weren’t given that King was a local organizer. We weren’t given everything he did up until the Voting Rights Act. And when I joined this movement as a young person, I realized, oh, King is so much more. Barber: I see the legacy of Dr. King as even beyond the civil rights movement. I see the legacy connected to the Old Testament prophets who stood up for the marginalized and against injustice, to the social gospel movement that stood up and asked a question, ”What would Jesus do in the face of terrible economic inequities and damage to workers?” Right on through to the second Reconstruction, which I call the civil rights movement. You know, that intersectionality  —   fusion politics: bringing together blacks and whites and Latinos, and Jews and Christians and Muslims. But doing it in a way that takes race and class seriously and does not separate them. On Black Lives Matter addressing institutional change, Cullors: Folks have seen the protesting and the marching, the arrests. But folks haven’t actually sat down with movement leaders to say, ”And what else are you doing?” The negotiations with mayors, with chiefs of police, with county sheriffs  —   people are missing the negotiations because that’s not what gets highlighted in the media. And I think what we ask of folks is to be patient. Instead of heavily critiquing us, join us and help us strategize around what’s next and what’s possible. On the success and failure of historical movements, Barber: We are in a reality right now where we have less voting rights today than we had Aug. 6, 1965, after the Shelby decision and the inaction of the Congress. But that’s what movements do. This country is constantly going through reconstruction. And there are times when we have to do two things at the same time. We have to protect what was won and expand. So we have to fight in the courts, we have to fight in the street, we have to fight in the legislative halls, and we have to fight at the ballot box. Democracy is hard it is not easy. Cullors: I’m very grateful that I’m in this fight. And I’ve sat with civil rights leaders and I’ve sat with former [Black] Panthers who say, ”I’m sorry, we failed you.” And I say to them ”No, you didn’t. You’ve set the standard, and we are continuing to move that forward.” We can’t expect to undo 500 years. We just can’t expect to undo it in three or four decades. Barber: It says more about the failure of America, but it also says something about the greatness of movements and the seeds that were sown by Ella Baker and Dr. King and Rosa Parks. We are their children. . .. My mother said to me one day, ”Listen, we fought too hard for you to stop. You better fight, you better stand up.” That’s why our mantra is, no matter what they say to us, no matter how many death threats we get, no matter what politicians do, we are going forward together."

From Breweries To Symphonies, The Game Is On",NPR,Camila Domonoske,2016-02-06,2016.0,2.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/06/465842145/wanna-place-a-bet-from-breweries-to-symphonies-the-game-is-on,"Anybody can promise to wear the opponent’s jersey should their own team fall short. As far as friendly wagers go, that’s pretty pedestrian (I’m looking at you, Denver and Charlotte mayors). But a few of the bets placed on Super Bowl 50 have at least a little bit more skin in the game. Govs. Pat McRory of North Carolina and John Hickenlooper of Colorado have dueling donation pledges, with the loser supporting the other state’s needy. If the Panthers win, a North Carolina shelter will get 50 backpacks with school supplies and a food bank will get Coloradan cuisine: 50 cases of salsa, 500 boxes of crackers and 500 packages of sausages. If the Broncos emerge victorious, a Colorado food bank will get 50 cases of turkey burgers and 50 cases of turkey sausages from North Carolina’s Butterball. Meanwhile the states’ senators  —   Republicans Thom Tillis and Richard Burr from North Carolina, and Republican Cory Gardner and Democrat Michael Bennet from Colorado  —   have wagered a speech. The freshman senator from the losing state  —   that is, Tillis or Gardner  —   will congratulate the winning team and state, in great detail, on the Senate floor. And the symphony orchestras in both cities have  —   what else?  —   music on the line. In CSO vs. CSO (that’s the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra and the Colorado Symphony Orchestra) the Coloradans have pledged to play Sweet Caroline if the Panthers win, and the North Carolinians will perform   from Aaron Copland’s Rodeo.  The symphonies announced the wager in a video that features two conductors named Christopher, inexplicable,    British accents, Denver musicians chomping down on Fig Newtons (Newtons, get it?) Carolina orchestra members mocking Peyton Manning’s Nationwide ads and a very determined trumpet player wielding his instrument with a giant Panthers paw on. And an entire symphony orchestra doing the dab, of course. Then there are a truly impressive number of   wagers: And there are plenty of charitable ”wagers” where no matter who wins, nonprofits in both cities get a boost. The local United Way charities are holding book drives where, they say, ”our communities’ kids come out as the champs.” The Catholic charities from the two cities are holding a fundraising competition, with a target of $50, 000 for Super Bowl 50. Rabbis in both cities are holding an online fundraiser, with   of proceeds to the victor’s charity of choice and the rest to the loser’s pick. They’ve dubbed it ”Super Mitzvah 50,” and released competing hype videos. ”These are days when we celebrate God’s chosen team  —   the Carolina Panthers,” Rabbi Judy Schindler says. Temple Emanuel Denver went with a movie trailer approach, for a film called . .. Broncos Vs. Kitty Cats. Wondering if the local public radio stations got into the spirit? Charlotte’s WFAE was game for it, but Colorado Public Radio says they’re ”not the betting type.”"
112392,167025,WATCH: Republicans — Then And Now — Talking About Drug Addiction ,NPR,Eyder Peralta,2016-02-08,2016.0,2.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/08/466034600/watch-republicans-then-and-now-talking-about-drug-addiction,"If you pay attention to way Republican presidential candidates are talking about drug abuse, it seems vastly different from the way the party leaders of the past talked about the issue. Perhaps the new, more compassionate stance was synthesized best by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie during Saturday’s GOP debate. Christie touted his record of keeping drug abusers out of jails. ”This is a disease. It’s not a moral failing,” Christie said. Before we get to what it means, here are some videos for you to compare and contrast: Gov. Chris Christie, Feb. 6, 2016: ”   heroin addicted drug girl on the floor of the county lockup  —   I’m   for her life.” President Ronald Reagan, Aug. 4, 1986: ”We will refuse to let drug users blame their behavior on others.” Gov. Jeb Bush, Jan. 5, 2016: ”We need to eliminate the stigmas and the barriers. .. where they’re not embarrassed to say that I have an illness that I am now on the road to recovery on.” President George W. Bush, Feb. 12, 2002: ”Make no mistake about it, if you’re buying illegal drugs in America, it is likely that money is going to end up in the hands of terrorist organizations.” Carly Fiorina, Sept. 16, 2015: ”We do need criminal justice reform. .. It’s clearly not working.” President George H. W. Bush, Sept. 5, 1989: ”We need more prisons, more jails, more courts, more prosecutors.” The big question is, of course, whether the rhetorical shift will translate into action on the policy front. It’s worth noting that this shift started years ago. In 2012, for example, the war on drugs was mentioned only in passing in the party platform. In 2008, it was given a whole section. Mark Kleiman, a professor at the Marron Institute of Urban Management at New York University who has written books about the war on drugs, said he believes the change in tone ”is at least partly genuine.” ”It matches a broader change in public attitudes, [thought it’s] hard to guess how much impact it will have on policy,” Kleiman said. ”Republicans in Congress continue to block even minor sentencing reforms, and [Republican Sen. Ted] Cruz in particular turned   on that issue after he announced for President. It’s a safe bet that in practice Republicans overall will remain more wedded to harsh policies than Democrats.” Marc Levin, the policy director for Right on Crime, a conservative justice reform project that has advocated for treatment instead of jail time for drug users, said they have been ”very gratified” with the talk from GOP candidates. ”We believe in personal responsibility, but we also believe in redemption,” he said. ”Thus, it is not inconsistent to believe that the use of illegal drugs is destructive and should be discouraged, but at the same time prison is generally not the answer.” Curtis Marez, who has studied the racial dimensions of the issue at UC San Diego, told us via email that he doesn’t see a broad shift here. He explains that the Republican candidates are looking toward New Hampshire, which is currently in the middle of a heroin addiction epidemic, so most of the calls for a different approach have centered on that drug and ”not on the criminalization of marijuana and cocaine, which has disproportionately affected communities of color.” In other words, this has become a white issue. Also, Marez said, this talk of redemption and second chances ”fits right in with conservative narratives of sin and redemption.” He wrote: ”Recall how George W. Bush’s stories about overcoming alcohol abuse with the help of God endeared him to his base Bush also supported   drug and alcohol treatment programs. This suggests a conservative model of treatment couched in terms of sin and salvation rather diseases and cures —  which is in keeping with certain conservative ideas about religion and individual responsibility. From that perspective, drug abuse remains a moral failing but one that can be better addressed in treatment than in prison. But again the key point is that so far, such a model of drug treatment has been more inclined to find possibilities for redemption among white drug users than among drug users of color.”"

Instead, a used resupply capsule was stuffed with 1. 5 tons of trash and cut loose. All that trash will burn up over the Pacific Ocean when the Cygnus supply craft, the ”SS Deke Slayton II,”   Earth’s orbit, which not only makes this the biggest incinerator in the world, but also reminds us that the world itself can also serve as an incinerator. The craft’s thrusters will be used to send it down into the atmosphere  —   so it won’t be joining the increasingly dense cloud of space junk that orbits our planet. ”The deorbit burn and   of Cygnus will not air on NASA TV,” NASA says, somewhat disappointingly. A robotic arm was used to release Cygnus from the ISS at 7:26 a. m. ET, NASA says, ”while the space station was flying above Bolivia.” Carrying some 7, 700 pounds of supplies and experiments, the Cygnus commercial resupply craft reached the space station in early December."
113045,167739,How Best To Test For Zika Virus?,NPR,Rae Ellen Bichell,2016-03-10,2016.0,3.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/03/10/469549176/how-best-to-test-for-zika-virus,"Let’s say you’re a pregnant woman who recently traveled to Latin America or the Caribbean. You got a little sick shortly after the trip, with some combination of mild fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis. The big question now is: Did you have Zika virus? And, if so, is your fetus still healthy? ”Probably every day, patients come in questioning whether or not they would qualify for testing,” says Dr. Christine Curry, an   at the University of Miami, and Jackson Memorial Hospital. A preliminary study in Brazil makes a strong case for the link between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and a number of birth defects, including microcephaly. The infection has been associated with a range of outcomes in another study of nine U. S. women who caught the virus while traveling to regions where Zika is prevalent. If a patient has a particular travel history, Curry sends a sample of the woman’s blood to a lab for analysis. But it can take awhile for test results to come back, Curry says, and the waiting can be really stressful, especially for patients in the middle of a pregnancy. ”They’re trying to decide what to do with the pregnancy, given so many unknowns,” she says. ”The difference between two and four weeks can be the difference between being able to end a pregnancy and not.” There’s another problem: Some tests aren’t very reliable, so patients sometimes have to go through multiple rounds to confirm whether they had Zika. That puts Curry in a tricky situation when she’s counseling patients. ”It involves saying ’I don’t know’ and ’no one knows’ over and over again,” she says. Until recently, most samples of fluids from patients had to be sent to Atlanta for testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Now, about 30 local public health labs are gearing up to do the analysis themselves, including the District of Columbia’s department of forensic sciences, where Cleveland Weeden works as a medical technologist. Most days, Weeden says, he feels like an athlete stuck on the bench. Outbreaks are exciting, in a way, because he finally gets to put his expertise and skills to work. ”We’re the bench,” Weeden says. ”We get called into action when something goes on in the city.” A refrigerator behind Weeden holds plastic baggies with tubes of blood and urine from patients in the area. As of this week, his job is to test all these samples for Zika virus. Weeden expects to get the results to patients within three days, rather than four weeks. He’s running a procedure called    —   or Reverse   Chain Reaction. The CDC is now making materials for 750 of these kits. Each kit has enough for 500 individual tests, which look for pieces of the virus’ genetic material and answers ”yes” or ”no” to the question: ”Is there virus in this person’s blood?” Weeden says the test is pretty straightforward  —   except for one thing. ”From the time the person is bitten [by an infected mosquito] to the time they get to the doctor, no more than five to seven days can pass for us to [be able to] pick it up on PCR,” he says. That means that if PCR is to work, doctors have to collect patients’ blood within a week of the first signs of a fever and rash. The virus hangs around a little longer in urine, so doctors would have a slightly longer window of time  —   about two weeks  —   to collect those samples. But there’s an extra complication, Curry says: Most patients don’t rush to the doctor when their illness is mild. ”If someone had virus in their blood three weeks ago and they’re now cleared, the PCR’s not going to tell you that,” she says. In that case, a negative result could mean either that the person never had Zika, or that their body had already cleared it from their system by the time they got tested. That’s why labs like Weeden’s are trying to get hold of another kind of test that the CDC developed, which goes by yet another bulky acronym  —   the Zika  . This test looks for a protein in a person’s blood  —   a specific type of antibody  —   that shows what foreign things the body has fought off recently. The Zika   is widely seen as the best test available, right now, because it works over a longer time span than the first option. It’s also faster and cheaper than another more definitive test, and requires less specialized training to perform. According to the CDC, Zika antibodies appear in the blood ”starting 4 to 5 days after the start of illness and last for up to 12 weeks,” or even longer in some people. The CDC has produced about 100, 000 of these test kits, and is offering them free to qualified labs. But there’s one drawback: The test sometimes tells people they had Zika when they didn’t. An ideal test, all agree, would be specific to this particular virus and give a faster turnaround time  —   eliminating the need for the manpower, money and time required to go through the current layers of testing. It’s not just pregnant women who would benefit from a better test  —   so would patients who need blood transfusions in places like Puerto Rico, where health officials have been worried that patients might accidentally get Zika during transfusions with infected blood. So the officials have stopped accepting local donations and, instead, are now getting blood shipped in from the continental U. S. The third, more definitive, test is called PRNT, or the   neutralization test. Because PRNT is expensive and takes at least a week longer to do than the Zika   the ELISA test is widely considered the more practical option in many cases. ”And herein lies where science needs to innovate a bit,” says Ted Pierson, a virologist and senior investigator at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Sometime in December, Pierson and colleagues in his molecular virology lab dropped their work on dengue virus so they could press the pedal to the metal on Zika. Pierson’s work doesn’t focus on pregnant women or blood transfusions. ”I am focused on amino acids, hydroxyls and phosphates,” he explains. His team is trying to figure out how to make a better version of the antibody test  —   the Zika   test the CDC is distributing to labs. ”The problem here is actually quite simple,” Pierson explains. Viruses in the same family  —   in Zika’s case, the flaviviruses  —   can look similar on the outside, and the antibodies the human immune system uses to fight them can also be similar. So, if a person had been infected sometime along the way with another   virus in that family, like dengue or West Nile  —   or even if they simply had been vaccinated against yellow fever  —   they could test positive in a Zika antibody test. ”It’s a good example of where the devil is in the details,” Pierson says, and those details are what he and his colleagues are delving into now. ”What we, as a field, need to do is develop antigens that allow us to distinguish between the antibodies specific to Zika, versus those for other flaviviruses,” he says. The group is essentially stripping down the virus to figure out what is unique to Zika  —   what distinguishes it from related viruses. The researchers are particularly interested in proteins, like the ”fusion loop,” that lie on top of the virus and help it enter a human cell. Once those unique parts are identified, it might be possible to create a more specific test that has much lower odds of triggering false positives. That could take days to figure out  —   or months, Pierson says. ”You just can’t predict,” he says. ”This is science. We just have to do the experiments.” In the meantime, people across the country who have jobs like Cleveland Weeden’s will be working long days. ”You get physically tired,” Weeden admits. ”We’re not robots. Your hands cramp up after you pipette so much. But that’s what we’re here for. We’re public health scientists.” As the weather warms and mosquitoes start flying around, these scientists will keep on testing with  —   they hope  —   better and better tools."
113569,168347,"Unable To Compete On Price, Nuclear Power On The Decline In The U.S.",NPR,Brian Mann,2016-04-07,2016.0,4.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473379564/unable-to-compete-on-price-nuclear-power-on-the-decline-in-the-u-s,"Renewable energy and new technologies that are making   power more reliable are growing rapidly in the U. S. Renewables are so cheap in some parts of the country that they’re undercutting the price of older sources of electricity such as nuclear power. The impact has been significant on the nuclear industry, and a growing number of unprofitable reactors are shutting down. When the first nuclear power plants went online 60 years ago, nuclear energy seemed like the next big thing. In many ways, it lived up to that promise. It turned out to be remarkably safe and reliable and clean. It’s   and is the source of about 20 percent of the country’s electricity. But right from the start, people in the nuclear industry struggled with a big problem: cost. Making nuclear power cheap was the Holy Grail. It never panned out. Nuclear plants keep coming in  . And after the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011  —   when three nuclear reactors melted down after an earthquake and tsunami hit  —   companies were forced to spend millions of dollars more on safety equipment to keep older plants operating. ”It would be very difficult for any company to make a decision to try to build a new nuclear plant,” says Mike Twomey, a spokesman for Entergy Nuclear, which runs nuclear power plants. Entergy has already taken one unprofitable reactor offline in Vermont and plans to close two more plants that are losing money in upstate New York and Massachusetts. In all, 19 nuclear reactors are undergoing decommissioning, of which five have been shut down in the past decade, according to the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The main reason behind the wave of closures is a new generation of cheap,   power plants that has pushed the wholesale price of electricity into the basement. But Mycle Schneider, a nuclear industry analyst, says nuclear also faces growing price pressure from wind and solar. Renewable energy is so cheap in some parts of the U. S. that it’s even undercutting coal and natural gas. ”We are seeing really a radical shift in the competitive markets which leave nuclear power pretty much out in the rain,” Schneider says. Over the past decade, no new nuclear power plants have begun commercial operations in the U. S. the last reactor to start up in the U. S. was in Tennessee in 1996 (another unit at the same plant is expected to come online sometime later this year). There are a handful of new nuclear reactors under construction in the South, where energy markets are still highly regulated. Big power authorities there don’t face the kind of    competition that has revolutionized energy markets in other parts of the country. But even within the nuclear industry itself, a growing number of experts agree that the U. S. has reached a pivot point, where new nuclear power plants are just too expensive. ”We think that the costs of new nuclear right now are not competitive with other   technologies, renewables and storage that we see in the marketplace,” says Joe Dominguez, executive vice president for governmental and regulatory affairs and public policy at Exelon, a nuclear power company that has announced plans to close one of its existing reactors in New Jersey. Three other plants that are losing money in Illinois and upstate New York are also being reviewed for possible closure, Dominguez says. ”Right now we just don’t have any plans on the board to build any new reactors,” he says. Companies like Exelon and Entergy hope state governments will agree to subsidize their existing reactors, paying a premium for   nuclear power in the same way they now subsidize wind and solar. The companies say the steady power generated by nuclear still pays an important role stabilizing the nation’s energy grid. But America’s reactors are aging. The average is now 35 years old. With the new investment going to natural gas and increasingly to wind and solar, the old energy of the future may soon be eclipsed by the new energy of the future."
114255,169134,"Songs We Love: James Blake, ’I Need A Forest Fire (Feat. Bon Iver)’",NPR,Ann Powers,2016-05-11,2016.0,5.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/05/11/477660005/songs-we-love-james-blake-i-need-a-forest-fire-feat-bon-iver,"Be careful when you call for divine intervention. It will wreak havoc when it comes. Musicians have devised ways of containing it for ages, from the symphonic swell to the long build in gospel music known as ”the drive” from the mystical overtone explosions of free jazz to house music’s   breaks. Yet for all the finesse and experience behind these structures, the spirits they free within performers or the audience remain chaotic, overwhelming just as in life, when you’re truly touched on the dancefloor, the experience can induce not just pleasure, but shock, tears, possibly unwanted revelations. ”I Need a Forest Fire,” the quietly violent new collaboration between the English   man James Blake and his American counterpart, Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, approaches the   feeling of   release with a certain intellectual coolness that puts a different spin on the longing for such grace. In the process Blake and Vernon do something important: They confront their own debt to the soul of gospel music while acknowledging their inevitable distance from it. The song starts with a churchy keyboard line and Vernon whooping Blake murmurs his approval. The feeling is looser than the duo’s last collaboration, the similarly   ”Fall Creek Boys Choir,” with a more refined sense of swing. Yet a looped vocal quickly surfaces, bringing us back to Blake’s ghost world: another shade, another shadow. Lyrics about longing for a purifying cedar burn that might transform a stale relationship are tempered by mild rhetoric: ”I request another dream,” Vernon murmurs. When Blake sings, ”I’m saved by nature, but it always forgets what I need,” he’s laying out his very human,   predicament. He wants to let go into whatever the divine offers, but he can’t shake the conviction that he should stay in control. The song proceeds with these two impulses  —   the impulse to surrender and the need to keep the self intact  —   sparring and finding shape through each other. They take on the shapes of gospel and electronica, only to intertwine within a paradigm that rejects easy division. Vernon and Blake test out gentle melisma and moaning, building harmonies as if eager to access their inner Jagged Edge. Yet this all plays out against a backdrop of drones and hums that reminds the listener that we are not on some ”authentic”   Cloud Nine, but in a virtualized realm of samples and sequencers, where   like Flying Lotus and Blake’s other current collaborator Frank Ocean are challenging notions of the natural with as much aplomb as does Blake himself. One electronic element in ”I Need a Forest Fire”  —   a beep that sounds like it comes from a medical monitor  —   kept me returning to the image of the Angel in Tony Kushner’s Angels in America, set in the plague days of the 1980s, when so much of the electronic music that Blake mines first emerged. In that epic, the Messenger arrives and makes a total mess, shattering the floor of the   Prior Walter’s apartment, cracking open his kitchen appliances. Blake and Vernon’s calmer call for a spirit change doesn’t have that grandeur, but within it lurks the same understanding, that a real soul change will feel like a fury. ”Stop before I build a wall around me,” Blake cries softly at the song’s end. He’s almost welcoming the force that will tear down that wall. The Colour In Anything is out now via Polydor."
114694,169684,READ: President Obama’s Remembrance Of Muhammad Ali ,NPR,Arnie Seipel,2016-06-04,2016.0,6.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/06/04/480743833/read-president-obamas-remembrance-of-muhammad-ali,"Following the death of legendary boxer Muhammad Ali on Friday night, the White House released the following statement from President Obama, recalling the boxer’s legacy in sports and society: Muhammad Ali was The Greatest. Period. If you just asked him, he’d tell you. He’d tell you he was the double greatest that he’d ”handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder into jail.” But what made The Champ the greatest  —   what truly separated him from everyone else  —   is that everyone else would tell you pretty much the same thing. Like everyone else on the planet, Michelle and I mourn his passing. But we’re also grateful to God for how fortunate we are to have known him, if just for a while for how fortunate we all are that The Greatest chose to grace our time. In my private study, just off the Oval Office, I keep a pair of his gloves on display, just under that iconic photograph of him  —   the young champ, just 22 years old, roaring like a lion over a fallen Sonny Liston. I was too young when it was taken to understand who he was  —   still Cassius Clay, already an Olympic Gold Medal winner, yet to set out on a spiritual journey that would lead him to his Muslim faith, exile him at the peak of his power, and set the stage for his return to greatness with a name as familiar to the downtrodden in the slums of Southeast Asia and the villages of Africa as it was to cheering crowds in Madison Square Garden. ”I am America,” he once declared. ”I am the part you won’t recognize. But get used to me  —   black, confident, cocky my name, not yours my religion, not yours my goals, my own. Get used to me.” That’s the Ali I came to know as I came of age  —   not just as skilled a poet on the mic as he was a fighter in the ring, but a man who fought for what was right. A man who fought for us. He stood with King and Mandela stood up when it was hard spoke out when others wouldn’t. His fight outside the ring would cost him his title and his public standing. It would earn him enemies on the left and the right, make him reviled, and nearly send him to jail. But Ali stood his ground. And his victory helped us get used to the America we recognize today. He wasn’t perfect, of course. For all his magic in the ring, he could be careless with his words, and full of contradictions as his faith evolved. But his wonderful, infectious, even innocent spirit ultimately won him more fans than foes  —   maybe because in him, we hoped to see something of ourselves. Later, as his physical powers ebbed, he became an even more powerful force for peace and reconciliation around the world. We saw a man who said he was so mean he’d make medicine sick reveal a soft spot, visiting children with illness and disability around the world, telling them they, too, could become the greatest. We watched a hero light a torch, and fight his greatest fight of all on the world stage once again a battle against the disease that ravaged his body, but couldn’t take the spark from his eyes. Muhammad Ali shook up the world. And the world is better for it. We are all better for it. Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family, and we pray that the greatest fighter of them all finally rests in peace."

ET, The Justice Department is investigating the killing of Alton Sterling, a    black man who was shot to death early Tuesday after police were called to a convenience store in Baton Rouge, La. Witnesses captured the encounter on a cellphone video that shows two officers had Sterling on the ground at the time of the shooting. The FBI is opening a civil rights investigation into Sterling’s death, NPR’s Carrie Johnson reports, citing a statement from the Justice Department that says it is seeking a ”fair, thorough and impartial investigation.” Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie said Wednesday that the two officers involved in the shooting are on administrative leave, and that after conducting initial investigations, his department has turned the entire case over to U. S. attorneys and the FBI. The local district attorney said his office was not investigating the shooting either, leaving that to the Justice Department. NPR’s Martin Kaste reports that while criminal investigations are being conducted at the federal level, the local police department is still required by law to perform an internal administrative investigation into whether the officers should be disciplined or fired. The two officers were identified as Blane Salamoni, a   veteran of the force, and Howie Lake II, a   veteran. In the   video that was filmed from a nearby car, the officers are kneeling over Sterling, who is lying on the ground, when one is heard yelling, ”He’s got a gun! Gun!” At least one officer then draws a weapon from his holster and aims it at Sterling. Seconds later, shots are heard. After that video emerged Tuesday, it helped propel protests that involved dozens of people  —   many of them blocking the street where the shooting occurred. The shooting took place at the Triple S Food Mart on Baton Rouge’s North Foster Drive around 12:35 a. m. Tuesday. That’s when uniformed officers responded to a disturbance call that Baton Rouge police say came from someone who said ”a black male who was selling music [CDs] and wearing a red shirt threatened him with a gun.” The department says that after its officers made contact with Sterling in the convenience store’s parking lot, ”an altercation between Sterling and the officers ensued. Sterling was shot during the altercation and died at the scene.” We’ll include the video here with this warning: The video shows an intense scene that ends with gunfire. You can also see it online. The Daily Beast has published what it identifies as a second video of the shooting, recorded from a different angle and closer proximity. Warning: the video is more graphic than the one above. From the original video and witness accounts, it seems that the officers initially used a Taser on Sterling. The owner and manager of the Triple S store is Abdullah Muflahi. He tells local newspaper The Advocate that the officers retrieved a gun from Sterling’s pocket  —   but, Muflahi says, he didn’t see the man’s hands go near his pockets during the struggle. Muflahi, who tells The Advocate that Sterling had been selling CDs outside his store for several years, said the man was shot several times. The Advocate reports: ”Sterling appeared to die quickly, Muflahi said. Just after the killing, the officer who fired the bullets cursed, and both officers seemed like they were ’freaking out,’ Muflahi said. ”The store owner said he heard one of the officers say, ’Just leave him.’ ” Several public figures have issued statements about the incident  —   including U. S. Rep. Cedric Richmond,  . who said the video ”was deeply troubling and has understandably evoked strong emotion and anger in our community.” ”There are a number of unanswered questions surrounding Mr. Sterling’s death,” Richmond said, ”including questions about the initial calls for police presence, the level of force used by officers, the verbal and physical altercation, and the response of the officers after he was shot.” At a press conference, Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore said his office is not conducting its own investigation into the shooting. He said the U. S. attorneys will be investigating possible civil rights violations, ”but there’s also potential, and I use that word cautiously, that there’s also possible criminal violations that they will do as well,” Moore said. ”Their request to me is that I stand down and let them do their investigation whether it’s a civil rights violation or potential . .. criminal penalty, and I’m going to abide by that request,” he said. As The Associated Press notes, there’s a high bar for federal charges in cases like this: ”Similar investigations, which often take many months, were opened following the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York. ”Federal investigators must meet a high legal burden to bring a civil rights prosecution, establishing that an officer knowingly used unreasonable force under the circumstances and did not simply make a mistake or use poor judgment. Many federal probes conclude without criminal charges.” At the same press conference, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards called the video ”disturbing” but urged for calm in the community  —   as did a local religious leader, the police chief, the district attorney and the mayor. ”We are an inclusive community,” Mayor Kip Holden said. ”We have a wound right now, but we’ll be healing, and making this city and parish whole again.” Family Speaks At News Conference  The president of the Baton Rouge chapter of the NAACP, Mike McClanahan, is calling for the officers to be arrested on capital murder charges, adding later that there’s a need ”to root out the 1 percent of bad police officers.” Edmond Jordan, an attorney representing Sterling’s family  —   including Quinyetta McMillon, who has a    son, Cameron, with Alton Sterling  —   began his remarks today by thanking God for Apple, Google and Microsoft, a reference to the technology that helped bring details of Sterling’s shooting to light. Jordan then started his remarks with a pointed criticism of the police. ”One of the first things the Baton Rouge Police Department did,” Jordan said, was ”to go and confiscate the video system from Triple S Food Mart.” Citing a statement from the store’s owner, Jordan said that Abdullah Muflahi was ordered to sit in his car outside the store while police took the equipment, and that he was not presented with a search warrant. ”He’s confident that his video . .. shows the entire incident,” Jordan said, before urging local authorities to hand the case over to the Louisiana State Police. Describing Alton Sterling, McMillon said he ”is not what the mass media is making him out to be.” She said Sterling had been trying to earn a living  —   and that the officers had taken away a father whose children relied on him. As McMillon mentioned the killing’s effect on her oldest son, Cameron Sterling broke into tears and wailed in grief before being comforted and led away. She said Sterling was ”held unjustly and killed without regard for the lives” of his children."

The investigation centered on the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee’s use of the server while she was secretary of state. Lynch announced the decision in a statement Wednesday, saying Comey and ”career prosecutors and agents” unanimously recommended that the investigation be closed without charges. As NPR has reported, Lynch had previously indicated that she planned to accept the recommendations of agents and prosecutors in the case. She made that announcement following a bipartisan uproar over a meeting between her and former President Bill Clinton. And on Tuesday, Comey announced that the FBI would be recommending no charges. He roundly criticized Clinton and her team for poor judgment and a lack of caution but said ”no reasonable prosecutor” would bring criminal charges based on the evidence. Comey is set to testify before a congressional panel on Thursday. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is calling him in to ask questions about the investigation into Clinton’s emails."

The music stood out as well: Singles like ”Only Happy When It Rains,” ”Stupid Girl” and ”Push It” vaulted over the influence of grunge to make use of industrial and electronic elements, some   sheen and singer Shirley Manson’s unmistakable voice. But by the   Manson says, something felt out of alignment: Garbage’s music was out of vogue, and the members were under pressure from their label to make something that would find a foothold with pop radio. ”And we didn’t really want to do that, so we kind of just took a break,” she says. ”And luckily for us, in that time, we really found our own voice again as a band, and we lost a lot of our contractual obligations. So we found ourselves in a really great position to launch our own record label. It just felt right: We had something to say, and we needed to be together.” Strange Little Birds is Garbage’s latest album, released on Stunvolume, the label it collectively founded in 2012. It comes just ahead of Manson’s 50th birthday, and she says that her   years of performing have had a profound effect on both her instrument and her outlook. ”I mean, when I first started out, I didn’t even think of myself as an artist: I just thought of myself as a lucky girl who got a lucky break,” she says. ”It took me a long time, arguably a decade or more, before I thought, ’Actually, I am a musician, and I need to make music in order to be happy.’ And once I figured that out, I realized that I was a creative artist, and that changed the way I approached making music. It changed my intent, for want of a better word.” Shirley Manson spoke with NPR’s Rachel Martin hear more of their conversation at the audio link."
116059,171433,Clinton Campaign Says It Didn’t Know Orlando Shooter’s Father Was At Her Rally,NPR,Tamara Keith,2016-08-09,2016.0,8.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/08/09/489311398/clinton-campaign-says-it-didnt-know-orlando-shooters-father-was-at-her-rally,"Among the 3, 000 people Hillary Clinton drew to a rally in Florida last night was the father of the man responsible for killing 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando on June 12, according to a local news report. A Clinton campaign official tells NPR that the rally in Kissimmee, Fla. on Monday was open to the public. NBC affiliate WPTV identified one attendee as Seddique Mateen, the father of Omar Mateen, who was killed in a shootout with police after carrying out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U. S. history. ”This individual wasn’t invited as a guest, and the campaign was unaware of his attendance until after the event,” the Clinton campaign official said in an email exchange. Not only was Mateen at the event, but he was also positioned behind Clinton, so he was visible in photos and video of the candidate’s speech. Mateen is recognizable, in part, because he did so many interviews after the nightclub attack. After the Clinton rally, Mateen again did a television interview. ”Hillary Clinton is good for United States versus Donald Trump, who has no solutions,” he said to WPTV. Here’s WPTV’s description of finding and interviewing Mateen, which is a story in itself: ”WPTV happened to notice the man, who has a mustache and was wearing a red hat, behind Clinton. It was Seddique Mateen, the father of Orlando mass shooter Omar Mateen. . .. ” ’We’ve been cooperating with the federal government, and that’s about it,’ he said. ’Thank you.’ Mateen didn’t want to answer any other questions, but just hours later, we ran into him by chance at a rest stop on the way back to West Palm Beach. He wanted to do an interview and show us a sign he made for Clinton. ” ’Hillary Clinton is good for United States versus Donald Trump, who has no solutions,’ he said.” Check out WPTV’s full story for more quotes from Mateen. Last month, Clinton met privately in Orlando with family and friends of those killed at Pulse. She also paid a somber visit, laying white roses at a memorial at the club. Even at the start of last night’s rally, Clinton paid tribute to the victims and their loved ones. There is no reaction yet from Donald Trump’s campaign, but Clinton opponents are already seizing on it. We will update this story if Trump weighs in."
116502,171988,"Gene Wilder, Star Of ’Willy Wonka’ And ’Young Frankenstein,’ Dies",NPR,Glen Weldon,2016-08-29,2016.0,8.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/29/491847509/gene-wilder-star-of-willy-wonka-and-young-frankenstein-dies,"Actor and writer Gene Wilder, who brought his signature manic energy to films such as The Producers, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and the role that forever ensconced him in the collective memory of a generation of children, Willy Wonka  the Chocolate Factory, has died. He was 83. Wilder died early Monday at his home in Stamford, Conn. of complications from Alzheimer’s disease, according to a statement from his nephew Jordan  . ”The decision to wait until this time to disclose his condition wasn’t vanity, but more so that the countless young children that would smile or call out to him ’there’s Willy Wonka,’ would not have to be then exposed to an adult referencing illness or trouble and causing delight to travel to worry, disappointment or confusion,” the statement read. ”He simply couldn’t bear the idea of one less smile in the world.” In the first of his three pairings with director Mel Brooks, 1967’s The Producers, Wilder endeared himself to audiences as the anxious accountant Leo Bloom, a nebbish drawn into an elaborate scheme to create a surefire theatrical flop. Wilder’s pale blue eyes flashed on the movie screen, which helped lend him the profoundly soulful quality for which he became known. In roles such as Blazing Saddles’   gunslinger, and Silver Streak’s book editor, he exuded a gentleness and warmth. But he also fully committed to every performance. Young Frankenstein, the 1974 film in which he played the grandson of the infamous Victor Frankenstein, begins with a scene that shows off the deftness of his comedic gifts. As the pompous surgeon Frederick Frankenstein concludes a lecture, Wilder seems cool and slick, but when questioned about his grandfather’s work by a student, he ramps up into a hilarious screaming fit, allowing us to see just how fragile the young doctor’s composure truly is. As the eccentric chocolatier of Willy Wonka  the Chocolate Factory, Wilder tempered the   hysterics for which he was known with a slyly mysterious quality that lent the children’s film a peculiar, menacing edge. Famously, he refused to take the role unless his character could make his entrance limping out of the factory, planting his cane in the ground, and doing a somersault. When director Mel Stuart asked him why, Wilder said, ”Because from that time on, no one will know if I’m lying or telling the truth.” As a result, it’s Wilder’s performance in Wonka that’s perhaps his most indelible: He shades his cheerful confectioner with a capriciousness that serves to keep a film about a candy factory from feeling saccharine. Wilder’s 1984 marriage to comedian Gilda Radner turned the couple into   Hollywood royalty. Separately, both performers had been hugely popular together, they were beloved. Just five years later, however, Radner died of ovarian cancer, leaving Wilder devastated, according to his 2005 memoir, Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art. He went on to help found Gilda’s Club (now known as the Cancer Support Community) an organization that provides social and emotional support for cancer patients and their families. Wilder and Radner appeared together in three films. (He remarried in 1991.) Wilder   the screenplay for Young Frankenstein with Mel Brooks, and later in life he turned to writing full time, producing three novels and a collection of short stories."
116624,172116,Massive ’Doughnut’ Reef Discovered Behind Australia’s Great Barrier Reef,NPR,Rebecca Hersher,2016-09-02,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/02/492383489/massive-donut-reef-discovered-behind-australias-great-barrier-reef,"From the air, it looks like a    field of submerged doughnuts on the ocean floor. The limestone circles amount to a second, deeper reef behind the Great Barrier Reef, researchers say. The scientists who discovered it off the coast of northern Australia say they’re surprised by its vast size  —   and by the strange shapes. ”When the   shape of them was revealed, it was really surprising,” lead author Mardi McNeil of the University of Queensland tells the Australian broadcaster ABC. ”They form these fields of   structures . .. sometimes they’re like singular circular rings, sometimes in groups of three or four,” she adds. The ”they” McNeil refers to is an algae called Halimeda. When Halimeda is alive, it’s green. When it dies, it turns into white, flaky limestone pieces that look like cornflakes. The flakes build up over time  —   the newly discovered reef likely goes back 10, 000 years  —   and can make   mounds 30 feet tall and 600 feet across. The findings were published in the journal Coral Reefs. Those mounds, known as Halimeda bioherms, stretch much farther along the northern Australian coast than anyone expected. Scientists who study the shallow coast beyond the Great Barrier Reef  —   the     area  —   knew the large mounds of dead algae existed for decades, but they had previously thought the ecosystem covered about 800 square miles. The new finding triples that area. One of the study authors, Robin Beaman of James Cook University, says in a press release, ”We’ve known about these geological structures in the northern Great Barrier Reef since the 1970s and ’80s, but never before has the true nature of their shape, size and vast scale been revealed.” The team used laser image data that the Australian navy gathered by plane to make a   map of the ocean floor. Using laser imaging to map coral reefs isn’t new. The U. S. Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have used planes carrying laser imaging systems to make   maps of reefs off the coast of Florida in Biscayne National Park, Dry Tortugas National Park and the NOAA Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The new discovery could be helpful for scientists trying to understand the climate history on the Great Barrier Reef. As the algae lives, dies and calcifies, it forms layer upon layer of fossilized information on about 10, 000 years of living conditions in the ocean. ”Just like tree rings  —   the rings can tell you the age of when it was formed and the environment it was formed in. So you’ve got 20   piles of sediment that can tell you an awful lot about past oceanographic history,” Beaman tells ABC. And then there’s the question of what lives there today. Because the new reef is 60 feet to 150 feet deep, very few people have ever seen any part of it. McNeil says those who have dived there came back with different accounts. Everything from, ” ’they’re covered in this lush thick veneer of living green,’ ” she tells ABC, ”to ’just white limestone flakes, like a white desert.’ ”"
116726,172257,"Brian Fallon Loves Bruce Springsteen, Just Please Don’t Leave It At That",NPR,Miles Parks,2016-09-07,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/09/07/492856970/brian-fallon-loves-bruce-springsteen-just-please-dont-leave-it-at-that,"Brian Fallon starts to answer the question. ”It’s funny, because. ..” He trails off, and then tries again. ”And it. .. uh. ..” He laughs. Fallon has a solo record out. His band, The Gaslight Anthem, went on hiatus last year, and since then he’s fathered a second child. The question was about how having children changed him and his songwriting. A softball question, sure, and one any songwriter would’ve been asked enough times in interviews to make them question their decision to procreate at all. Fallon, after all, has been doing interviews for a decade, since The Gaslight Anthem’s debut in 2007. And yet he pauses. ”No one has ever asked me this question.” It’s the perfect reflection of the   Fallon has endured since he became a notable figure in rock music. He’s become almost a caricature of himself: classic cars and radios and Springsteen. So much Springsteen. ”The Gaslight Anthem is a band almost exclusively defined by their relationship with Bruce Springsteen,” Pitchfork wrote in a scathing review of The Gaslight Anthem’s Get Hurt. Fallon admits that the review cut him deep. Springsteen is a huge influence on Fallon he just isn’t the only one. ”It really does frustrate me, and it’s harder because I love Bruce Springsteen,” Fallon says. ”And I don’t want to say anything negative about it, because I love him so much, musically and personally. ”But I don’t want to get lost  —   I don’t want my career to be lost in a Bruce Springsteen comparison.” Still, there’s no sense pretending that Fallon is blameless here. On Gaslight’s breakthrough record, The ’59 Sound, Fallon   a number of artists, but none more prominently than Springsteen. ”We tattooed lines beneath our skin,” he sings at one point, adding, ”No surrender, my Bobby Jean.” Also, Fallon and Springsteen are both from New Jersey, and both occasionally sing like they’ve got throats full of sawdust and forgotten dreams. The comparison obviously helped in The Gaslight Anthem’s rise, but at some point it became a burden for Fallon to bear as he tried to evolve and experiment. ”I didn’t say I was the next Bruce Springsteen you said that,” Fallon says, referring to music journalists. ”This is not my claim. I’m not the savior of rock ’n’ roll you said that. And, as a matter of fact, I think it’s ridiculous.” Fallon’s solo debut, Painkillers, is more   and noticeably quieter than any album Fallon has released before. There are Gaslight Anthem fans, and rock purists, who simply aren’t going to like it. He worked with producer Butch Walker, who told him to not ”give a s*** what the fans are gonna think.” Some people, Walker says, will be unhappy whenever things change. ”There’s a lot of people who want to eat the same thing off the value menu every day the rest of their life and come home and watch Fox News the rest of their life,” Walker says. ”And listen to the records they liked whenever things were simpler for them and their life didn’t suck. And you know what? That’s cool, but as an artist you can’t stay in that box the rest of your life, because we grow, man.” Earlier this summer, at Shaky Knees Music Festival in Atlanta, Fallon sat wearing a dark denim jacket, sipping a coffee around noon. Two years prior, The Gaslight Anthem played the 8 p. m. Friday slot at this festival, opposite Spoon. Today, Fallon is sandwiched into a 2:30 p. m. set that he’ll play alone, with just an acoustic guitar and a harmonica. ”There are some things that are whispered and some things that are shouted, and I’m not in a shouting place right now,” he says. Fallon mentions The Felice Brothers’ 2008 ballad ”Wonderful Life” as he talks about the kind of songs and lyrics he’s looking to write these days. ”That’s the thing about telling the truth,” he says, after quoting the song’s third verse   . ”You don’t have to yell to be angry, and you don’t have to cry to be sad. You can just say things.” Painkillers has brightness, to be sure, even as it deals with themes Fallon has written about his whole career: jealousy, regret, mistrust. Themes that were ”embedded” in him when he was born into a   household. ”That was the first lesson I learned  —   that nothing is permanent,” Fallon says. ”There’s even an old Bible verse that comes to mind like, if the foundation be destroyed, what can the righteous do? What happens, who do you trust? When you’re born and it’s smashed up like that. .. I don’t. ... I don’t know.” As his band was going through its final years (at least for now) so was his marriage. Fallon and his wife of more than 10 years divorced, and since then he’s found a new relationship and had a second child. They’re life changes that might be interesting to hear about, if someone would just ask him about something other than Bruce Springsteen. ”I feel like I don’t even live on the same planet that the person five years ago lived on,” he says.

116853,172416,Supreme Court Leaves Ohio Voting Restrictions In Place,NPR,Nina Totenberg,2016-09-13,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493774554/supreme-court-leaves-ohio-voting-restrictions-in-place,"The U. S. Supreme Court refused to intervene in a voting rights case from Ohio on Tuesday, leaving intact a reduction of early voting days that was enacted by the state’s   Legislature. The cutback still allows for 23 days in which voters can cast   ballots prior to Election Day, but it eliminates the   Golden Week in which voters can both register and cast ballots. The state argued that it was within its rights to eliminate that week to ease the administrative burden on state and local officials, and it noted that it had added an extra Sunday to early voting to settle a challenge brought by the NAACP. Ohio Democrats, however, maintained that the remaining cutback still placed a disproportionate burden on minority voters. This summer, the Supreme Court has repeatedly refused to intervene in voting rights cases so close to the November election. In other cases, that has meant the court has left intact lower court rulings that struck down strict voter ID laws and limits on early voting. In this one case, however, it meant that the lower court decision upholding the early voting rollback was left in place. Privately, Democratic lawyers were not surprised by the court’s action Tuesday, since they had little expectation of blocking the Ohio cutbacks  —   especially compared with the far more draconian changes in other states such as Texas, North Carolina and Michigan. Indeed, Ohio was considered the outlier in a series of cases testing voting rights cutbacks, because the Buckeye State still left more than three weeks for voters to cast ballots prior to Election Day on Nov. 8. In 2013, the Supreme Court, by a   vote, struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act that for decades had required areas with a history of discrimination in voting to get advance clearance from the U. S. Justice Department prior to making any changes in voting procedures. Within weeks of that ruling,   state legislatures began enacting laws that made voting more difficult  —   cutting back on early voting days, adopting strict voter ID provisions, and other measures. In the three years since, challenges to those provisions in Texas, North Carolina and Michigan, among other places, have made their way through the lower courts and in the past three months were struck down by federal appeals courts as deliberate attempts to burden minority voters. Ohio went the other way. This summer, as the November election draws near, the Supreme Court declined to intervene at the behest of states seeking to block the lower court decisions that struck down the new restrictions. In those cases, some or all of the court’s conservative justices voted to block the lower court decisions and reinstate the cutbacks, but they fell short of the necessary five votes to prevail. By contrast, in the Ohio case, where the 6th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the cutback, the liberal justices did not vote to intervene. The court’s   order leaving the cutbacks intact noted no dissents."
116947,172513,"A Piece Of The Past, A Price In The Present: Paying For The Erie Canal",NPR,Hansi Lo Wang,2016-09-16,2016.0,9.0,http://www.npr.org/2016/09/16/492440709/a-piece-of-the-past-a-price-in-the-present-paying-for-the-erie-canal,"Mules named Sal are hard to find these days along the Erie Canal. But almost two centuries after workers began digging its route across upstate New York, you can still see barges pushed and pulled through what some consider the first superhighway of the U. S. As the canal prepares to celebrate its bicentennial next July, some are questioning whether the canal is still worth subsidizing. After the original canal was completed in 1825, the   waterway was a technological marvel. It shortened the trek from eastern New York to the Great Lakes from two weeks by wagon to just five days on the water. By today’s standards, though, the ride is slow and steady with stops every so often at canal locks that act like water elevators for barges and boats. ”The canal used to be very busy,” says tugboat captain Mark Smith, who adds locals didn’t used to pay much attention to canal workers like him. ”They probably didn’t look twice at a tugboat with a fuel barge. Nobody thought anything of it. Now it’s kind of a novelty.” ”It was really neat to see it happen again. And it’s too bad it doesn’t happen more often,” says Maureen Buechner, who watched Smith’s tugboat, the Margot, glide through a lock in Waterford, N. Y. with a barge carrying three electrical transformers headed for a power plant. ”That’s how everything traveled. Now, you have trucks, trains. This is an old way of life.” But the Margot’s owners aren’t ready to rule it out yet. Business is growing for the New York State Marine Highway Transportation Company, according to   Rob Goldman. His crew has found steady work towing barges of stone and sometimes oversized cargo like fighter planes along an expanded Erie Canal, also known as the New York State Barge Canal, that was completed in 1918. ”Let’s face it: a barge can’t deliver to your front door. A truck can,” Goldman admits. ”But if we work with the trucks and we work with the rail, we can each be as efficient as possible and use as little fuel as possible because we’re efficient.” Efficiency, though, is probably not the priority for most of the people who use the canal. Recreational boats are driving most of the canal’s revenue today. Travelers like Art Cohn enjoy taking the scenic route at about five miles per hour. ”That’s a really interesting way to see the world. Normally if I’m home, I’m driving, you know, highway speeds and if someone’s moving too slow, I’m getting frustrated. Not on the canal,” says Cohn, a   of the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum who toured the canal this summer to share prints of early paintings of the canal. Tolls and permits for New York’s entire canal system, including the Erie Canal, brought in about $1. 5 million in 2014, according to the latest figures from the New York State Canal Corporation. But it took about $55 million to operate and maintain the canals. Drivers on the New York State Thruway were making up most of the difference. The trucking industry sued the state for using highway tolls to fund the canals and won in federal court in August. But by the time the judge ruled, state lawmakers had already transferred the canal system from the New York State Thruway Authority to another agency, the New York Power Authority, which has been funding the canals since April. In a written statement to NPR, the Power Authority says revenue from its hydropower plants, not taxpayers, is funding the canals from now on. Still, some residents see the canals as a financial drain. ”The state should not get involved in anything like that in my mind. If it can’t stand on its own two legs and make money, then we need to understand that,” says Joe Shaw, a regular jogger along the trails of the Old Erie Canal State Historic Park near his home in Manlius, N. Y. Many business leaders are also concerned about the high costs of maintaining the canals. ”It’s completely upside down from a commercial standpoint,” says Darren Suarez, director of government affairs for the Business Council of New York State. ”You will continue to lose money.” Still, Suarez acknowledges the potential for growth in tourism along the Erie Canal, pointing to studies estimating that visitors can generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for the local economy. One major hurdle, though, is that awareness about this legendary ”Gateway to the West” has fallen to the wayside, according to Natalie Stetson, executive director of the Erie Canal Museum in Syracuse, N. Y. ”The canal suffers from the fact that people don’t know it exists anymore,” Stetson says. ”They think it’s a piece of history.” But it’s history that residents like Debbie Cummings of Syracuse still take pride in. ”You think of all the labor that went into digging this huge ditch from Albany to Buffalo,” Cummings says, ”And it’s still here!” And according to New York’s constitution, the working parts of the Erie Canal will stay under the state’s ”management and control forever.”"
117491,173200,"Tax Soda To Fight Obesity, WHO Urges Nations Around The Globe",NPR,Allison Aubrey,2016-10-11,2016.0,10.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/10/11/497525337/tax-soda-to-fight-obesity-who-urges-nations-around-the-globe,"The World Health Organization has already urged us to cut back on sugar, limiting added sugars to no more than 10 percent of our daily calories. So, how might policymakers get people to follow this advice? In a new report, the WHO is urging governments around the world to tax soda and other sugary drinks. In its report, the World Health Organization points to systematic reviews of policies aimed at improving diet and preventing lifestyle diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. ”The evidence was strongest and most consistent for the effectiveness of   beverage taxes in the range of  % in reducing consumption,” the WHO’s   concludes. Dr. Douglas Bettcher, director of the WHO’s Department for the Prevention of Noncommunicable Diseases, says that ”consumption of free sugars, including products like sugary drinks, is a major factor in the global increase of people suffering from obesity and diabetes.” ”If governments tax products like sugary drinks, they can reduce suffering and save lives. They can also cut healthcare costs and increase revenues to invest in health services,” Bettcher was quoted as saying in a WHO release on the report. The International Council of Beverages Associations, which represents soda companies and other   around the globe, says it’s disappointed with the new WHO report. ”We strongly disagree with the committee’s recommendation to tax beverages, as it is an unproven idea that has not been shown to improve public health based on global experiences to date,” an ICBA release concludes. As we’ve reported, Philadelphia passed a tax on sweetened beverages earlier this year. And researchers documented a decline in sales of sugary drinks in Mexico after a tax was passed in 2014. Similar measures are on the ballot this year in San Francisco and Oakland, Calif. as well as in Boulder, Colo. Last year, as we reported, researchers at George Washington University and the Harvard School of Public Health published a   estimate of the health impacts of a     tax on sugary drinks in Philadelphia. ”We’d expect over 12, 000 cases of obesity prevented by the end of the   period, as well as $65 million in health care cost savings over the   period,” Michael Long, a researcher at GW, told us earlier this year. ”The evidence is clear,” Long told us. ”When prices go up, people buy less of things.” In the months leading up to the vote in Philadelphia, the American Beverage Association spent more than $4. 2 million in media buys to turn public opinion against the tax. The ABA is currently supporting a campaign to defeat the initiatives in California. The findings of a new study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine show that the largest players in the soda industry, the   Co. and PepsiCo, spent millions of dollars between 2011 and 2015 lobbying against 29 different public health bills that aimed to either improve nutrition or reduce soda consumption."

Its scientific name means giant, misshapen phallus and it is not hard to see why. A giant column called a spadix rises 7 feet into the air from the center of a pleated funnel. When the plant blooms (every decade or so) that spadix actually heats up to about 90 degrees. The stench that inspires its common name  —   the corpse flower  —   comes from a putrid blend of chemicals the bloom sends into the air. The odor has notes of old fish, unwashed feet and rotting cabbage. This plant is pretending to be a dead animal. Why? In the wild, when insects searching for carrion are tricked into entering the corpse flower, they become unwitting aides in the plant’s reproduction, carrying pollen from one corpse plant to another corpse plant nearby. In recent years, the corpse flower’s deceit has attracted another pollinator: humans. Botanical conservatories from Denver to Sydney want the stinky   in their collections. And to keep the domesticated corpse flowers going, botanists must take the place of insects. They carefully collect corpse flower pollen and send it in the mail to the next garden down the road.

118241,174094,5 Big Foreign Policy Challenges For President-Elect Trump,NPR,NPR Staff,2016-11-12,2016.0,11.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/11/12/501145459/5-big-foreign-policy-challenges-for-president-elect-trump,"Donald Trump, a neophyte in foreign policy and national security issues, will take office in January facing a world of challenges. The  ’s campaign trail pronouncements on international affairs were sometimes contradictory, often vague and seldom substantive, leaving many in the U. S. and abroad to speculate about what exactly his foreign and defense policies might look like. NPR journalists in Washington and around the world weigh in on some of the thorniest and most pressing international issues a Trump administration will confront. China, One of   Trump’s biggest challenges will be managing what has become an increasingly contentious relationship between the United States and China. From an economic perspective, the U. S. relationship with China has never been closer. The two countries traded more than $650 billion worth of goods in 2015, making China the U. S.’s   trading partner. Politically, however, the relationship has chilled amidst U. S. accusations of Chinese hacking and Chinese complaints that the United States is trying to contain China’s growing influence in Asia. While the Chinese might welcome Trump’s   style, his campaign rhetoric about China has rarely veered from the vitriolic. ”We can’t allow China to rape our country,” Trump told supporters in May when complaining about China’s tough trade tactics. Trump has promised to label China a ”currency manipulator” on his first day of office, and he has pledged to impose tariffs of up to 45 percent on Chinese imports to help resuscitate America’s manufacturing sector. Such a move may instead lead to more imports from other developing countries, but if implemented, it would certainly damage China’s economy. The country is undergoing an historic economic transition, its growth has slowed and it still relies heavily on exports, so a trade spat with one of its most important trading partners could have widespread consequences. On the geopolitical front, Trump has hinted he would reevaluate U. S. military alliances with Japan and South Korea, which could lead to a military power vacuum in the   region. This comes at a time when China’s leaders are spending more than ever on military capabilities and are eager to test their military might. But a closer look at writings by Trump’s advisors tells a different story. They assert that as president, Trump will rebuild the U. S. Navy, adding more than 70 ships to its current fleet, in part to protect the $5 trillion of annual trade across the South China Sea  —   a region China is eager to control.  —  Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz, Russia, Trump comes to office at a time when U. S.  relations are at their lowest point since the Cold War. The Obama administration has engaged mostly in   over how to deal with Syria’s civil war  —   and Putin has used the vacuum to take decisive, if brutal, action to intervene on President Bashar Assad’s behalf and reestablish Russian influence in the Middle East and on the world stage. Ukraine has become Europe’s forgotten war. Putin’s No. 1 priority is to get the West to accept (if not recognize) the annexation of Crimea and ease economic sanctions. Discord between the U. S. and the EU could help Putin achieve this goal. During the election campaign, Trump suggested he might reconsider sanctions against Russia. If the United States drops sanctions, other European countries could follow, breaking the   EU’s tenuous consensus on sanctions. American leadership is vital to keeping the NATO alliance together. The Obama administration has pledged $3. 4 billion of military spending in Europe for 2017. Also next year, the U. S. will lead the deployment of a new NATO battalion based in Poland, as well as rotate an armored brigade through the region. Again, Putin may see opportunity arising from Trump’s comments that he would pull back from NATO.  —  Moscow correspondent Lucian Kim, Syria, The war in Syria has dragged on for more than five years, displacing millions of people, killing hundreds of thousands. Powerful countries  —   Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia as well as the U. S.  —   support different sides in the   conflict, but none has been willing or able to devote the political clout and firepower to ensure their faction actually wins. Syrian rebels had hoped that would change with a Hillary Clinton presidency, with the U. S. putting more blood and treasure behind its declaration that Assad has lost legitimacy and should go. They hoped Clinton would implement a   zone to end airstrikes by Assad and his Russian allies that strike civilian infrastructure. Those hopes have now been crushed with Clinton’s defeat. While Trump’s policies are hard to predict, he has spoken approvingly of what he calls Assad’s efforts to crush ISIS, and of the Syrian president’s Russian ally, Vladimir Putin. It is possible Trump would back them, and cut off slim American lifelines to rebel forces in what could be a decisive tilt of the battlefield toward the regime in Damascus.   —  Beirut correspondent Alice Fordham, Terrorism, Trump inherits a war against the Islamic State entering its next act, with offensives underway or in the works against the terrorist strongholds of Mosul, in Iraq, and Raqqa, in Syria. U. S. commanders and Iraqi leaders hope the battle in Mosul might be finished or nearly over by the time Trump is inaugurated, but the Raqqa offensive may still be in full swing by the time he takes office  —   if it has even begun. President Obama’s ISIS strategy has been to help local fighters, including Iraq’s military and, in the case of Syria, indigenous Kurds, Arabs and others. American forces are mostly in ”supporting” roles, training combatants and providing combat power from the air. Trump’s views about how he’d prosecute the wars are unclear. He said during the campaign that he had a secret plan to defeat ISIS. Then he said he’d ask the Pentagon for a new plan. Whichever top national security advisers he brings in to run his Defense Department and intelligence community may have an outsize influence in the   policy. One challenge for both the outgoing Obama and incoming Trump administrations is the danger that, as allied forces in Syria and Iraq squeeze ISIS, this will yield more terrorist attacks in the West  —   possibly even the United States. Obama and his top leaders have acknowledged that the terror danger might not go away even after a battlefield defeat of the ISIS ”caliphate,” given the number of potential attackers who could be hiding in the West or who might be inspired to lash out. And no one expects ISIS to be defeated for good, even if Mosul and Raqqa fall. It has spread to Afghanistan, Libya and elsewhere, and may continue to exist as an insurgency in western Iraq and parts of northern Syria.  —  National Security senior editor Philip Ewing, Trade, Donald Trump’s victory could have a profound effect both on U. S. and global trade, which is already slowing. Trump says he plans to make good on campaign promises to rip up or renegotiate free trade deals within his first 100 days in office. That includes NAFTA, the    free trade deal between the U. S. Canada and Mexico, which Trump has called the worst trade deal the U. S. has ever signed. Analysts say ripping up the pact could hugely disrupt and hurt companies, including American manufacturers. Trump will find it difficult to roll back a trade agreement that has been in place so long and includes protections against unilateral withdrawal, but could slowly kill the deal by repudiating elements of it and enforcing trade restrictions. Other pending international trade agreements are also in jeopardy, including the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the U. S. and the European Union, and the   Partnership (TPP) which would bring together the U. S. and 11 Pacific Rim nations. The TPP is a key element to the Obama administration’s ”pivot” to Asia, a strategy to build up economic and security relations with Asian nations as a hedge to China’s increasing clout in the region. Trump promises to slap to big tariffs on Chinese imports, which would raise the cost of consumer goods coming in to the U. S. China could respond by shutting off market access and raising tariffs on imports from the U. S. which could hurt American manufacturing, financial services and even agricultural sectors. The concern is this could spark a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Analyst warn that Trump needs to go slow on his trade agenda, otherwise he risks retaliation from some of the world’s most important trade partners.  —  International Affairs correspondent Jackie Northam"
119261,175378,"In Pro-Brexit English City, A Jobs Crisis Is Averted — But For How Long?",NPR,Frank Langfitt,2016-12-30,2016.0,12.0,http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/12/30/505410043/in-pro-brexit-english-city-a-jobs-crisis-is-averted-but-for-how-long,"Voters in the English city of Sunderland did something extraordinary last June. They voted by 61. 3 percent to leave the European Union, even though it put tens of thousands of local jobs at risk. Why would so many people vote against the economic interests of their hometown? The answer lies in factors that also figured in the American presidential race: opposition to immigration and a perceived threat to white identity. Sunderland’s largest private employer is the Japanese carmaker Nissan. The company first came here in the   because the United Kingdom’s membership in the EU allowed the firm to export cars to the European continent,  . Today, Nissan and its network of suppliers employ an estimated 30, 000 people in the area. By voting for Brexit, residents were threatening Nissan’s business plan. Predictably, Nissan responded with a threat of its own: no more investment unless the U. K. government offered protection from the damage that Brexit could inflict on its balance sheet. Fearful of losing a crucial employer, the U. K. pledged to help Nissan remain ”competitive,” which most people took as a promise to protect it from any costs imposed by Brexit. Nissan then announced it would put two new models in the Sunderland plant. Meanwhile, the government has not, so far, disclosed any details to the public about whether that commitment includes financial support. So the crisis has been averted for now. But for many in Sunderland, this was a cautionary tale about how populist politics can put an economy at risk. ”It caused us sleepless nights, we were depressed for weeks,” said Denise Walter, a committee member at the Philadelphia Cricket and Community Club, where some Nissan workers hang out. Sunderland is part of England’s industrial heartland  —   the equivalent of Michigan or Ohio in the U. S. Like communities in those states, Sunderland has watched industrial jobs disappear over the decades, as the city’s   business moved to East Asia and its coal mines closed. Walter saw the Brexit vote as a   wound Sunderland couldn’t afford. ”Our local [council members] have worked very hard trying to bring initiatives like this to the northeast,” she said, ”and this was just throwing everything away.” Among those who voted for Brexit were people who rely on Nissan for their livelihoods. Derek Baker works for one of Nissan’s parts suppliers and voted out because he wanted the U. K. to tighten its borders and limit immigration. Baker declined to speak with NPR, but his son, Bailey, a law student at the University of Sunderland, shared an exchange they had on the issue. Bailey Baker warned his father that by voting for Brexit, he was putting his own job at risk. ”Nissan will never leave, they’ve invested so much into the plant already,” his father replied. After Nissan threatened to halt further investment, ”He didn’t speak for a couple of days,” said Bailey Baker. ”I said, ’I told you so, Dad. ’” To appreciate what drove some of the Brexit vote here, it’s helpful to visit the Humbledon and Plains Farm Working Men’s Club, which offers pool, darts and cheap beer to a local   community. On Election Day, it also serves as a polling station. About 200 people voted here in last year’s general elections, according to local officials. Turnout for June’s Brexit referendum was nearly 40 percent higher. That caught the attention of Leslie Scott, a former city mayor who monitored the polls for the Brexit referendum. ”My lasting memory of this polling station was them coming in and saying virtually every time, ’What do we do? ’” Scott recalled. ”So, we were obviously experiencing people who’d never ever voted in their lives.” Scott also noticed voters proudly displaying patriotic symbols like the Union Jack, the flag of the United Kingdom, which some U. K. white nationalists have   in the past. ”We knew then that something was different about this election,” Scott said, referring to the Brexit vote. One recent evening, a couple of dozen   women descend on the club for country line dancing. They   and spin across the worn, parquet floor past a stage draped in American and Confederate flags. Tommy Wardropper, who is sitting in the bar, says he backed Brexit to keep foreigners out. ”We don’t want more of them coming in, Muslims, immigrants. Closing our borders would be better for our country,” says Wardropper, who works as a plumber. Wardropper followed the U. S. presidential race and is a big fan of the  : ”I love Trump, because he’s going to get rid of all the alien Muslims.” Wardropper is wearing a soccer jersey featuring a red cross on a white background. It’s known as the St. George’s Cross and serves as the flag for England, separate from the Union Jack. Wardropper is proud of his English heritage but says cherished symbols like this are increasingly under attack in multicultural Britain. ”We can’t even put the George cross in our bedroom windows!” Wardropper complains. That’s not true. Even on the drive to the club, two English flags are visible outside nearby homes. When this is pointed out, Wardropper counters: ”Well, you can [show the flag] but it upsets the Muslims.” Dan Evans, one of Wardropper’s drinking buddies, also voted for Brexit because he was tired of the United Kingdom having to follow EU law. Evans also complains that Muslims get special treatment on construction sites because of their faith. Evans spent two years building a paint factory inside the Nissan facility. Like Derek Baker, he gambled that Nissan was too heavily invested in Sunderland to shut its doors. And so far, that bet has paid off. Many here, though, wonder how long Nissan will remain committed to Sunderland and are concerned about the message the Brexit vote here sends. ”I worry about the attractiveness of any further foreign direct investment in a place like Sunderland if we are outside the European Union,” says Brian Snowdon, who teaches economics at nearby Durham University, Unlike most patrons at the working men’s club, Nigel Lee voted to stay in the European Union.

What’s clear in this community is that many are determined to keep it white  —   and were willing to put the city’s economy at risk to do so."
119947,176872,Canada to offer temporary residency to travelers stranded by U.S,Reuters,David Ljunggren and Alastair Sharp,2017-01-30,2017.0,1.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-canada-idUSKBN15D16A  ," Canada will offer temporary residency to any travelers stranded by U. S. President Donald Trump’s orders temporarily barring people from seven   countries, a senior official said on Sunday. Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen told a news conference he did not know how many people might be eligible but said only a handful of passengers headed to the United States from Canada had been denied boarding. Trump’s decision on Friday, which also affects refugees, left many people uncertain of whether they could enter the United States. ”Let me assure those who may be stranded in Canada that I will use my authority as minister to provide them with temporary residency if they need it,” Hussen said. Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has refrained from criticizing the United States, which takes 75 percent of Canadian exports, preferring instead to stress Canada is open to refugees. ”Every country has the right to determine their policies,” said Hussen. The Canadian Council for Refugees and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, or CCLA, called on Ottawa to withdraw from a Safe Third Country agreement with the United States, under which Canada returns asylum seekers crossing the border. ”There’s a danger that the U. S. is doing blanket detentions and deportations . .. and not honoring asylum claims,” said CCLA Executive Director Sukanya Pillay. Such a move would be diplomatically insulting and Hussen said the pact would remain unchanged for now. Local and national politicians have condemned Trump’s ban and the opposition New Democrats want an emergency debate in the federal Parliament. The U. S. Consulate in Toronto said it would suspend services on Monday because of a planned demonstration. More than 200 Canadian technology company founders, executives and investors said on Sunday that Ottawa should immediately give temporary residency to those displaced by Trump’s order. ”(We) understand the power of inclusion and diversity of thought, and that talent and skill know no borders,” they said in an open letter. Canada wants to attract tech workers from abroad while  retaining those who are often lured away. More than 300, 000 Canadians work in California’s Silicon Valley. Bob Vaez, the   chief executive of tech firm Event Mobi, canceled plans on Sunday to accept an industry award in Las Vegas. Many event organizers could seek alternative locations, he said. ”Are they going to keep their conferences in the U. S. knowing that so many people are going to be barred?” he said.

120474,177927,Washington PR offensive fails to quell Europe’s anxiety over Trump,Reuters,Noah Barkin,2017-02-19,2017.0,2.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-security-usa-europe-analysis-idUSKBN15X0RM  ," One month into the unusual presidency of Donald Trump, his most senior cabinet members were deployed to Brussels, Bonn and Munich this week to reassure nervous Europeans that everything would be okay. The Europeans heard from Defense Secretary James Mattis that the NATO military alliance was not ”obsolete” after all, despite Trump’s repeated suggestions to the contrary. And they were told by Vice President Mike Pence that Russia would be ”held accountable” for its actions in Ukraine, despite Trump’s friendly overtures to Russian President Vladimir Putin. But if the aim of the visits was to reassure Europe that the pillars of U. S. foreign policy are fully intact, they fell short of the mark, European diplomats, politicians and analysts gathered in Munich said.  ”What we heard here is not reassuring,” Ruprecht Polenz, former head of the foreign affairs committee in the German parliament, told Reuters after Pence’s speech to the Munich Security Conference. ”There is absolutely no vision for how we are going to work together, going forward.” Pence was the   member of the Trump team to travel to Europe and his address was eagerly awaited. Eight years ago in the same hall, his predecessor Joe Biden made headlines with a promise to ”reset” relations with Russia. But unlike Biden, Pence came to Munich with a fatal handicap: the perception, fueled by the circumstances surrounding the recent resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn, that he is not part of Trump’s inner circle. ”His mission was always going to be hard, but it was made even more so by the questions about his lack of influence inside the White House,” said Derek Chollet, a top defense policy adviser to former president Barack Obama who is now with the German Marshall Fund of the United States. ”ROBOTIC SALUTE” The vice president tried to tackle these doubts   by making clear at the start of his speech that he was speaking for Trump. But then he went on to mention the president 19 times in the course of the   speech, prompting one audience member, the author and historian Robert Kagan, to dismiss the address as a ”robotic salute to the man in power”. ”Pence and Mattis and Tillerson can come here and talk about the importance of the transatlantic relationship and NATO   and that is all good,” said Elmar Brok, head of the foreign affairs committee of the European Parliament and a party ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ”But we don’t know what’s coming on Twitter tomorrow morning,” he said, referring to Trump’s penchant for spilling out policy statements via social media. Flynn’s resignation has deepened the mystery over who Trump will listen to on foreign policy, although his chief strategist Steve Bannon and    Jared Kushner are both seen as influential.  One European diplomat likened the challenge of figuring out who to listen to in the Trump administration to the task of ”Kremlinologists” during the Cold War. Ulrich Speck, a foreign policy analyst at the Elcano think tank in Brussels, said the conundrum that Henry Kissinger evoked when he famously asked who he should call when he wanted to talk to ”Europe” seemed to have been turned on its head. ”Now Europe is asking who it should call if it wants to talk to the United States,” Speck said. Besides his reassurances on NATO and Russia relations, Pence tried to assuage fears that the United States is moving away from democratic values under Trump, who has attacked the media and judiciary repeatedly since taking power a month ago. ”This is President Trump’s promise,” Pence said. ”We will stand with Europe, today and every day, because we are bound together by the same noble ideals  —   freedom, democracy, justice, and the rule of law.” EU SUPPORT This message was welcomed, but others went down poorly. Pence raised eyebrows by suggesting that the nuclear deal between the world’s major powers and Iran, which has strong support across Europe, was freeing up resources for Tehran to promote terrorism. And his repeated references to ”radical Islamic terrorism” irked some who feel the Trump administration is targeting all Muslims in its fight against extremists. Merkel explicitly warned against this in a speech just before Pence spoke. Some audience members were also dismissive of Pence’s promise to relegate Islamic State to the ”  of history” saying such hyperbolic rhetoric was better suited to a U. S. election campaign than a European audience. French Foreign Minister   Ayrault expressed his displeasure with the fact that Pence had not sent a message of support for the European Union, something Munich organizer Wolfgang Ischinger had called on the vice president to do before the conference. Trump has praised Britain’s decision to leave the EU and suggested other countries follow, stirring concerns that he could abandon decades of U. S. policy and actively encourage the disintegration of the   bloc. ”I was struck that he never mentioned the EU,” said Ayrault.

120598,178202,U.N. mediator not expecting quick breakthrough in Syria peace talks,Reuters,Tom Miles and Stephanie Nebehay,2017-02-23,2017.0,2.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-un-idUSKBN16122B  ," U. N. mediator Staffan de Mistura said on Wednesday he did not expect an immediate breakthrough when Syria peace talks restart on Thursday but wanted productive talks that relaunch the process towards a political solution to end the   war. They will be the first U. N.  negotiations on Syria in almost a year, during which time the military and geopolitical context has changed massively. Even so, the same disagreements are likely to resurface. De Mistura said Russia, which has supported President Bashar  ’s military advances, had asked the Syrian government to ”silence their own skies in the areas touched by the ceasefire” during the talks. Countries close to the opposition were also asked to urge them to lessen provocations, he said. ”Am I expecting a breakthrough? No, I’m not expecting a breakthrough,” de Mistura told a news conference. ”But I am expecting and determined for keeping a very   momentum,” he said. Hours later, the Syrian opposition called for    negotiations with the government delegation, saying it was hoping for a ”serious partner” while casting doubt on Damascus’ readiness. Spokesman Salem   speaking to reporters, said the opposition delegation did not want this round to be like the one a year ago that was fruitless. Referring to the delegation led by Syrian Ambassador to the U. N. in New York Bashar  ’afari, he said: ”We have experience with this regime. They’re not here to negotiate about a political transition, but they’re here to buy time and commit more crimes in Syria. There’s no trust in this regime.” De Mistura said he hoped neither side would seek to disrupt the talks by provoking the other and that momentum towards a political solution was necessary to thwart ”spoilers” bent on derailing peace efforts. The U. N. Security Council, which met at the U. N headquarters to discuss Syria, said the humanitarian situation ”will continue to deteriorate further in the absence of a political solution to the crisis.” Ukraine’s Volodymyr Yelchenko, the council’s current president, said the council ”expressed hope that the   talks in Geneva will produce tangible results” while moving towards ”a   and   political transition.” Asked if it had been discussed whether Assad would remain in power, Yelchenko said that was a subject for the Geneva talks. While the Geneva talks will focus on politics, de Mistura said he expected more rounds of talks in the Kazakh capital, Astana, convened by Russia, Turkey and Iran, to deal with the ceasefire and related humanitarian issues, including prisoners.  He declined to discuss the format of the Geneva talks, which he said would start with bilateral meetings, and did not say what his objectives were for this round. But he said the negotiations would be guided by U. N. Security Council resolution 2254, which refers to the establishment of credible and inclusive governance, the process for drafting a new constitution and free and fair elections.  ”We will be very reluctant to engage in   and in fact I will be refusing them,” he said.

120658,178327,"Buffett scorns tricky Wall Street accounting, but defends buybacks",Reuters,Trevor Hunnicutt,2017-02-25,2017.0,2.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-berkshire-hatha-buffett-buybacks-idUSKBN1640Q7  ," Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Saturday attacked what he saw as tricks used by U. S. companies to boost earnings and stock prices, but he defended one   practice: share buybacks. ”As the subject of repurchases has come to a boil, some people have come close to calling them    —  characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert funds needed for productive endeavors,” Buffett said in his annual letter to shareholders. ”That simply isn’t the case: Both American corporations and private investors are today awash in funds looking to be sensibly deployed. I’m not aware of any enticing project that in recent years has died for lack of capital.” Some critics, including BlackRock Inc ( ) Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink, think the practice of companies buying back their own shares to boost earnings has been used to excess. Repurchasing shares boosts earnings per share by reducing the shares remaining on the market. Critics contend the money can be better used to hire employees or buy equipment. Buybacks fell to an average $2. 3 billion a day during the   earnings season, TrimTabs Investment Research Inc data showed on Monday, after spiking to $5. 7 billion a day in    2015. Last month, Fink warned CEOs of S&P 500   companies in a letter that the world’s largest asset manager would be looking for an explanation of how cash from corporate tax cuts touted by U. S. President Donald Trump will be used, especially if it is deployed for buybacks. Buffett can buy Berkshire’s own shares back at 120 percent or less of book value, but that has ”proved hard to do,” Buffett said. ”Our buying out ’partners’ at a discount is not a particularly gratifying way of making money. Still, market circumstances could create a situation in which repurchases would benefit both continuing and exiting shareholders,” he said. ”If so, we will be ready to act.” ACCOUNTING TRICKS Buffett was less sanguine on other practices used by public companies, saying ”too many” are deviating from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to present better earnings numbers. Buffett said it ”makes us nervous” that companies regularly leave out what they call ”restructuring costs” and ”  compensation” from their expenses, boosting profits by deviating from standard accounting practices. ”To tell owners year after year, ’Don’t count this,’ when management is simply making business adjustments that are necessary, is misleading. And too many analysts and journalists fall for this baloney.”  (Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Jennifer Ablan)   KONG Chinese private equity firm GSR Capital is looking to buy a substantial holding in Chile’s Sociedad Quimica Y Minera (SQM) one of the world’s biggest lithium producers, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.

120678,178378,Treason charges against Russian cyber experts linked to seven-year-old accusations,Reuters,Jack Stubbs and Svetlana Reiter,2017-02-26,2017.0,2.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cyber-insight-idUSKBN1650MA  ," Treason charges brought in December against two Russian state security officers and a   expert in Moscow relate to allegations made by a Russian businessman seven years ago, according to the businessman and a source connected with the investigation. They said the arrests concern allegations that the suspects passed secrets to U. S. firm Verisign and other unidentified American companies, which in turn shared them with U. S. intelligence agencies. Ruslan Stoyanov, head of the computer incidents investigation team at Russian   firm Kaspersky Lab, was arrested and charged with treason in December along with two officers of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) since identified as Sergei Mikhailov and Dmitry Dokuchayev. Authorities have given no public explanation for the arrests, which, as Reuters has previously reported, caused a chill in cooperation between Russians and U. S. researchers in the cyber   field. The source connected to the investigation said the arrests were a result of accusations first made in 2010 by Pavel Vrublevsky, a Russian businessman and founder of ChronoPay, an online payments company. Vrublevsky told Reuters he had also learned that the arrests were a response to his allegations: that Stoyanov and Mikhailov had passed secrets on to American firms. A representative for Stoyanov’s defense team declined to comment for this article. Reuters was unable to locate representatives for Mikhailov or Dokuchayev. Verisign denies that it received information that was secret. The firm’s iDefense unit compiled dossiers on cyber crime for clients including private firms and government agencies that include U. S. intelligence services, but it says its research did not contain classified information. Its employees have said they knew Stoyanov, a former Russian police cyber crime official who later had a career as a consultant. “Nothing like the arrangement as described by Pavel Vrublevsky ever took place,” said Kimberly Zenz, a former analyst at Verisign’s iDefense unit who knows Stoyanov. Verisign Vice President Joshua Ray declined to comment on Stoyanov specifically, but said his company acquired information in unclassified ways and does not believe its reports to government agencies and other customers included state secrets. Stoyanov’s employer, Kaspersky, declined to comment, but referred back to an earlier statement in which it said the charges against Stoyanov related to a period before he joined the company in 2012. Russian authorities, including the FSB, have declined to comment on the case. The Kremlin has said only that President Vladimir Putin is aware of reports about it. Reuters received no reply to requests for comment from the FSB and Kremlin for this story.   NO ACTION FOR YEARS Until now, the Russian authorities had taken no action over the allegations made by Vrublevsky against Stoyanov and Mikhailov. December’s arrests came shortly after the United States accused Russia of trying to influence its presidential election through computer hacking, an accusation Moscow denies. Reuters has reported in the past that researchers in the cyber security field in both countries believe Moscow intended the arrests as a signal, in response to the U. S. hacking accusations, that it would now take action against forms of cooperation that it previously tolerated. That conclusion is likely to be reinforced by the apparent resurrection of the    Vrublevsky allegations, which the Russian authorities previously did not follow up on. “I can confirm we (Chronopay) expect to be part of this case. In 2010 we provided the FSB and other important Russian agencies with evidence that at least one FSB employee, as well as several other people, were involved in treason,” Vrublevsky told Reuters, referring to his past allegations against Stoyanov and Mikhailov. After Vrublevsky first made his allegations against Stoyanov and Mikhailov, he was arrested and convicted on charges of organizing a cyber attack on a rival Internet payments firm that competed with ChronoPay. He is now free on parole and has always denied guilt. He has long said the charges against him were brought by Russian authorities in part as a result of information about his business activity that was illegally leaked by FSB officer Mikhailov to Stoyanov, who worked in the private sector as a consultant and had contacts with Western firms including Verisign. Vrublevsky said he believed Mikhailov and Stoyanov also passed secrets to other firms, although Verisign is the only firm he has identified. Vrublevsky and the source connected to the investigation also disclosed that a fourth person had been arrested in the case. They identified him as Georgy Fomchenkov, although they did not say how he was connect with the treason allegations. The source connected to the investigation said Fomchenkov was a former FSB officer. Reuters was unable to contact Fomchenkov or a representative of him, find any further information about his identity from publicly available sources, or determine what role he was accused of playing in the case. Public documents available online show Stoyanov and Fomchenkov both had appeals against their detention rejected by the Moscow District Military Court on Feb. 15. Two days later, Mikhailov lost an appeal at the same court, which often hears sensitive cases relating to state security. Neither Vrublevsky nor the source connected with the investigation offered an explanation as to why they believe the Russian authorities would resurrect such an old case seven years after the allegations were first made. However, the source said he believed the case may not be the sole reason why Russian authorities had decided to arrest the men now: in his experience, he said, Russian authorities at times use old cases as a way of charging people suspected of later crimes.

121072,179196,Intel’s $15 billion purchase of Mobileye shakes up driverless car sector,Reuters,"Tova Cohen, Ari Rabinovitch and Paul Lienert",2017-03-13,2017.0,3.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-mobileye-idUSKBN16K0ZP  ," Intel Corp ( ) agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye ( ) for $15. 3 billion on Monday in a deal that could thrust the U. S. chipmaker into direct competition with rivals Nvidia Corp ( ) and Qualcomm Inc ( ) to develop driverless systems for global automakers.  The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world’s largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world’s carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel   valuations of    . The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully   cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition’s price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen   companies developing different components for   systems, from robotics to sensors.  Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips,   networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. ”This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,” said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. ”Mobileye’s technology is very critical. .. The price seems fair,” she added. Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move ”very far outside its core business franchise.”  The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry’s   deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the ”very expensive transaction” improved Intel’s position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end. Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye’s earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands’ NXP.  The $63.   cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye’s closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its   high closing price of $64. 14 in August 2015. Mobileye’s shares rose 28. 2 percent to close at $60. 62, while Intel’s shares were down 2. 1 percent.  The market for   technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc’s Waymo ( ) to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc ( ). Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC ( ) which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4. 0 percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies. MERGING ’EYES’ AND ’BRAIN’ Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4. 2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7. 7 billion. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye’s operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the ”eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car.” Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for   systems   the building blocks for   cars   to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: ”If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player. .. The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data.” Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public   last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla’s Autopilot system. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for   and   systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173. 3 million last year. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel’s biggest car importer and one of Mobileye’s earliest investors, also holds a 7 percent stake. BATTLE FOR   Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW ( ) on a project to put a fleet of around 40   test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its   of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a   platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The   deal, which will create the industry’s largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017.

121413,179918,Dollar hits four-month low as Trump trade deflates,Reuters,Dion Rabouin,2017-03-27,2017.0,3.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-forex-idUSKBN16X135?il=0  ," The dollar fell to its lowest since November against a basket of currencies on Monday as investors lost confidence in prospects for a U. S. fiscal spending boost under President Donald Trump after his failure to pass a major healthcare reform bill. Trump’s inability to deliver on his campaign pledge to overhaul the nation’s healthcare system marked a big setback for a Republican president whose own party controls Congress, and raised doubts over whether he will be able to see through tax reforms and a proposed spike in spending. The dollar recovered broadly during North American trading, but remained down 0. 45 percent on the day against the basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength . DXY. It earlier fell as low as 98. 858, the lowest since Nov. 11. ”The assumption was that if you can’t get healthcare done that some of the other things on his agenda, mainly the tax reform, would be a harder sell,” said John Doyle, director of markets at Tempus Inc in Washington. The dollar index had risen to a   high near 104. 00 in early January when expectations for   stimulus under the Trump presidency were at their peak, with investors betting on the   ”Trumpflation” trade. For the third week in a row, speculators increased bullish bets on the U. S. dollar in the week up to last Tuesday, pushing net long bets to their highest since Jan. 31, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday.

Sterling, the worst performer among the Group of 10 major currencies against the dollar this year, hit an   high of $1. 2615  . ”The British pound is still close to its weakest level in 30 years, so it has some upside especially since data out of the UK has been better,” Doyle said. ”The Japanese yen has had a great run because stocks around the globe are down. So if you start breaking it down into each individual currency there’s a good reason, but overall it’s just a dollar negative day.” The dollar rose more than 3 percent against the South African rand   after the country’s Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan was asked by President Jacob Zuma to return early from an investor roadshow abroad, prompting worries of a looming cabinet reshuffle.

121955,181067,N.Y. man gets 25 years to life for 1979 murder of Etan Patz,Reuters,Laila Kearney,2017-04-18,2017.0,4.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-patz-idUSKBN17K0ZA  ," A former delicatessen worker convicted of killing    Etan Patz in a 1979 New York slaying that helped raise national awareness about the plight of abducted children was sentenced on Tuesday to 25 years to life in prison. Pedro Hernandez, 56, showed no emotion as he was handed the maximum allowed sentence for the murder by Justice Maxwell Wiley in state court in Manhattan.  ”Nearly two generations have come and gone since Etan disappeared,” New York City District Attorney Cyrus Vance told a press conference after the sentencing. ”But today . .. justice has been served.” Hernandez, who a jury found guilty in February, declined to speak at his sentencing. His attorney, Harvey Fishbein, said Hernandez sympathized with the Patz family, but that he maintained his innocence.  ”Pedro Hernandez is not the answer to what happened to Etan Patz 38 years ago,” Fishbein said, adding that the defense team planned to appeal. ”This is not the end.” Patz vanished as he walked alone for the first time to a school bus stop in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood on May 25, 1979. He would become one of the first missing children to appear on the side of a milk carton seeking information. For more than three decades, the case endured as one of the country’s most infamous missing child cases until police arrested Hernandez in May 2012 after receiving a tip. Hernandez, who worked in a bodega near the bus stop, confessed to strangling the boy and then leaving his body in a box outside. His lawyers argued the admission was the result of police coercion as well as mental illness that made it difficult for Hernandez to separate fantasy from reality. Patz’s body was never found, leaving the confession as the key evidence at trial. The defense also pointed to another man, Jose Ramos, a convicted pedophile who was long considered a suspect.  A previous trial ended in a mistrial in 2015 when a single juror out of 12 refused to convict Hernandez after weeks of deliberations, prompting prosecutors to retry him.

122177,181542,Google parent Alphabet’s profit up 29 percent on strong ad sales,Reuters,Julia Love and Rishika Sadam,2017-04-27,2017.0,4.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-results-idUSKBN17T2ZZ?il=0  ,"Alphabet’s profit beat Wall Street estimates and rose 29 percent to $5. 43 billion, a performance that analysts called exceptional for a company so large.  ”For a company of Google’s size to post the growth that it has is just a testament to the quality and usefulness of the products they make,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “They are the dominant force in digital advertising.” Shares of the company rose 2. 8 percent to $916. 80 after the bell on Thursday. Like its   Facebook Inc ( ) Google has aggressively shifted the focus of its business to mobile advertising. The two companies accounted for 99 percent of the industry growth in digital advertising in 2016, Pivotal Research said in a report this week, demonstrating market power that some advertisers complain amounts to a duopoly. ”It underscores a macro theme we are seeing in the internet space, which is that the bigger players are getting bigger and the smaller players are treading water or shrinking,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. Google is expected to command a 61. 6 percent share of the search ad market worldwide in 2017, up from 60. 6 percent in 2016, according to research firm eMarketer. Mobile ads command lower prices than desktop ads, but growing volume is more than making up the difference, Wang said.  ”Our great properties    like Search, Maps, YouTube and Google Play    are the ’prime time’ for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested,” Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during a call with analysts. Google’s revenue rose 22. 2 percent to $24. 75 billion from $20. 26 billion in the quarter ended March 31. ( ) Paid clicks, where an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on ads, rose 44 percent. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 29. 7 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Net income rose to $5. 43 billion, or $7. 73 per share, from $4. 21 billion, or $6. 02 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on an average had expected a   profit of $7. 34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters    . Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said during the earnings call that ”YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate,” dispelling concerns about the possible impact of an advertiser boycott of the video service.   YouTube had come under fire for ads appearing alongside videos carrying homophobic or   messages, prompting a number of companies to suspend their digital ads on the video service. “Advertisers can be fickle and certainly the approval of the advertiser is critical, but less so than the approval of the user,” said Phil Bak, CEO of ACSI Funds, an asset manager.      CLOUD, HARDWARE REVENUES SOAR   Google’s   revenue, which consists mainly of the cloud computing business, the Pixel smartphones and the Play store, also grew dramatically in the quarter, jumping 49. 4 percent to $3. 10 billion.  Google has long trailed Amazon. com Inc ( ) and Microsoft Corp ( ) in the burgeoning market for cloud computing. But since the arrival in late 2015 of veteran enterprise computing executive Diane Greene, who leads the business, Google has begun winning many more major deals, Pichai said during the call.   ”We’re seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a   business,” Pichai said.  The strong growth in hardware and cloud computing helps assuage investors’ concerns about Google’s dependence on search, Wang said. ”We have wanted to see Google be more than just an advertising company,” he said. ”That is quite an impressive achievement.” On the other hand, Alphabet’s ”Other Bets”   business units including the Waymo   car business, Google Fiber,   Nest and the life sciences firm    to post large losses and modest revenues. Revenues from Alphabet’s “Other Bets,” climbed to $244 million, up from $165 million in the   quarter; Nest, Verily and Fiber accounted for the bulk of that, Porat said on the call. But losses widened to $855 million from $774 million in the   quarter. Alphabet CEO Larry Page released a letter Thursday defending the    Alphabet structure, which he said had achieved its objective of giving investors greater visibility into Google’s performance while empowering entrepreneurs in other parts of the company.  “With the change to Alphabet, oversight has been easier because of increased visibility,” Page wrote. “We have streamlined efforts where it made sense and in other areas we have seen places to double down.”  (Reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru and Julia Love in San Francisco.

122190,181560,Wells Fargo overhauls lawmaking and policy arm,Reuters,Dan Freed,2017-04-27,2017.0,4.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-lobbying-idUSKBN17T3CX?il=0  ,"The bank has had a difficult seven months since a sales scandal that severely damaged its reputation and led to the departure of   and CEO John Stumpf in October. Stumpf’s sudden retirement came after he was slammed by U. S. lawmakers. Still, David Moskowitz, the   head of the lobbying and policy unit, said the overhaul was not a response to the scandal, nor to the bank’s failure of a ”living will” test administered by federal regulators that led to the bank’s decision to temporarily halt the growth of its balance sheet. ”This is not a reaction to all the events of the last year,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview. Instead, he said the bank’s decision was about having a more coordinated public policy approach, rather than each business unit operating somewhat independently. While that siloed structure was one of the criticisms mentioned in an investigative report released by the Board of Directors, Moskowitz said the new structure was not a response to the report.  ”I don’t think there had been duplication of effort,” he said. ”I need to integrate these things better into the business priorities of the company, to the needs of its customers, to help us rebuild trust and build the better bank that we’re going to work for.” The new unit will bring together several responsibilities that had been in different areas of the bank, including federal, regulatory, state and local government relations, political programs, external relations and public policy. Moskowitz said he would hire more people for the unit, though he would not yet say how many. When Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia at the start of 2009, it more than doubled its size and became the fourth largest U. S. bank. It eventually passed Citigroup and became the third largest. Following the Wachovia acquisition, its government relations team had two people. That number has since grown to six.

Cobalt, set up by two former bankers, wants to use blockchain, the underlying technology behind bitcoin, to reduce   costs in currency trading, and to speed up the time in which transactions are settled. It said it will go live with its spot currency trading system in the third quarter of this year.      Citadel and XTX Markets, both leading electronic   join a handful of top banks in committing to be clients of the system when it launches, though Cobalt declined to say what their financial commitment amounted to.  ”We’ve got significant endorsement from two of the largest institutional FX trading participants in the market, who are leaders in technology,” Adrian Patten, Cobalt’s chairman and   and a former foreign exchange trader at UBS and Deutsche Bank, told Reuters.  Blockchain, also known as distributed ledger technology, works as a     and settlement system. It creates a ”golden record” of any given set of data that is automatically replicated for all parties in a secure network, eliminating any need for   verification.   processing costs banks tens of millions of dollars each year, so blockchain technology which is cheaper and quicker is attractive. But many people believe blockchain is still at least five to ten years away from   adoption.  Foreign exchange trades currently need multiple records for buyer, seller, broker, clearer and third parties and then reconciliation across multiple systems, at a significant cost.  Patten said it could provide savings for banks and other   like Citadel and XTX of as much as 80 percent on their   spend.  ”We are delighted to be part of the Cobalt initiative to reduce risk and cost in   FX, and we look forward to working with them and other members of the network to transform the landscape,” said Zar Amrolia,   executive of XTX.   Citi ( ) has invested in Cobalt and is a launch client, Cobalt has said.

123238,183699,"Qatar willing to listen to Gulf concerns, Kuwait says",Reuters,Noah Browning and Tom Finn,2017-06-11,2017.0,6.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gulf-qatar-idUSKBN1920P2  ," Qatar is ready to listen to the concerns of Gulf Arab states that have cut diplomatic and economic ties, Kuwait said on Sunday, as it tried to mediate a solution to the worst regional crisis in years. Saudi Arabia and allies Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) severed ties with Qatar last week, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and   Iran   charges Doha denies. The rift has disrupted travel, separated families, severed commercial links and sown confusion among banks and businesses while deepening divisions between their respective allies fighting in wars and political struggles from Libya to Yemen.     ”(Kuwait) affirms the readiness of the brothers in Qatar to understand the reality of the qualms and concerns of their brothers and to heed the noble endeavors to enhance security and stability,” Kuwait’s state news agency KUNA quoted Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah     as saying. Kuwait, which has retained ties with Qatar and has often acted as a mediator in regional disputes, said it wanted to resolve the dispute ”within the unified Gulf house”. A previous mediation effort by Kuwait in which the Emir Sheikh Sabah       shuttled between Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Doha, failed to achieve an immediate breakthrough. ”Is this the beginning of wisdom and reasonable thinking? I hope so,” UAE minister of state for foreign affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on Twitter in reaction to Kuwait saying Qatar was ready to listen to the grievances. Morocco, a close ally of the Gulf countries, said on Sunday it would remain neutral and offered to facilitate dialogue. ”If the parties so wish, the Kingdom of Morocco is ready to offer its services to foster a frank and comprehensive dialogue on the basis of   in internal affairs and the fight against religious extremism,” a statement from the country’s foreign ministry read. U. S. President Donald Trump at first offered to host Qatar and its adversaries   all U. S. allies   at the White House, but on Friday said Qatar has been a   sponsor of terrorism and backed the Gulf pressure. Saudi Arabia’s powerful Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman discussed efforts to ”counter terrorism and extremism” in a telephone call with U. S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Sunday, state news agency SPA said.  But a Qatari diplomat said the crisis reflected a lack of U. S. leadership. ”This is the biggest testimony to U. S. failure in the Gulf,” the diplomat told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. ”(It) gives others the impression the U. S. does not know how to manage the relationship with its allies or is incapable.” On Friday Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt tightened their squeeze on Qatar by putting dozens of figures and charities they link to the country on terrorism blacklists. Qatar’s official overseer of charities denied on Sunday that philanthropic groups in the country backed terrorism, saying it deplored the accusation. IRAN FLIGHTS A peninsular nation of 2. 5 million people, Qatar has for years punched well above its weight in world affairs by parleying its vast gas wealth into influence across the region, irking many with its maverick stances and support for Islamists. But it was importing 80 percent of its food from bigger Gulf Arab neighbors before they cut ties and is now in talks with Iran and Turkey to secure food and water supplies. Iran   the main regional rival of Saudi Arabia   sent four cargo planes of food to Qatar and plans to provide 100 tonnes of fruit and vegetables every day, Iranian officials said on Sunday, amid concerns of shortages. Senior officials from the countries opposed to Qatar have warned it that appealing for foreign assistance will not advance a reconciliation. Qatar’s energy minister said on Sunday Doha remained committed to an oil output cut deal agreed by OPEC and   producers last month. Mohammed   said in a statement: ”circumstances in the region shall not prevent the state of Qatar from honoring its international commitment of cutting its oil production”. In a sign Gulf states were seeking to lessen the human impact of their June 5 severing of ties, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE said on Sunday they had set up hotlines to help families with Qatari members, without elaborating.

The BIS said the pace of globalization had been slowed by the global financial crisis, and that challenges created by an uneven distribution of wealth are known, but there was no basis to say it was going into reverse.  ”Arguments that question the benefits of globalization have been receiving greater attention in the public debate,” head of the BIS, Jaime Caruana, said in a   chapter of its annual report. ”This shows that we risk forgetting the lessons of the past and taking for granted the gains in living standards, productivity and prosperity achieved over the last  .”  The report said there was strong empirical evidence that globalization was also not actually the main cause of increased   income inequality; technology was. Globalization itself has seen ”global value chain” trade between emerging markets more than double since 2001 with China alone now responsible for 19 percent of that compared to 7 percent at the start of the century. And although global trade is growing at a slower rate than the world economy for one of the only times since the   large multinational firms still account for around 90 percent of trade in the United States.   credit to firms and governments in emerging markets has also doubled since the outbreak of the financial crisis to $3. 6 trillion, as global interest rates have tumbled.  Over the last two decades there has also been significant rise in the   of global asset prices. For example, the correlation of advanced economy sovereign   bond yields have more than doubled relative to the previous two.      Some of the options the BIS report cites to address the problematic effects of globalization include government policies to foster more adaptability, such as retraining programs and employment initiatives in affected regions. Banking systems also have to be made strong enough so any financial busts can be cleared up quickly. It also called for globally applicable regulations and for   currency swap lines between the world’s big central banks. ”Instead of retreating from the ties of global trade and finance, we should reinforce them. Instead of loosening them, we should make them more resilient,” Caruana said.

123798,184833,European utilities ready for new wave of mergers,Reuters,Andrés González and Arno Schuetze,2017-07-04,2017.0,7.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-utilities-m-a-europe-idUSKBN19P26M  ," Spanish power company Gas Natural ( ) has fired the starting gun in what is expected to be the biggest upheaval among European utility companies for a decade. Chairman Isidre Faine has contacted his counterpart at Portuguese rival Energias de Portugal (EDP) about a 35 billion euro ($40 billion) deal to create Europe’s fourth biggest utility firm by market value, according to sources. While the companies denied on Tuesday there were talks, bankers and analysts say a new Iberian power champion would threaten the dominance of France’s EDF ( ) and Italy’s Enel ( ) and could unleash a wave of European mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in a sector ripe for consolidation. The impetus for change is partly coming from the growing shift to green energy sources. Supplies of   wind and solar power are surging in Europe, forcing down wholesale electricity prices and posing a threat to the traditional model of centralized power generation and distribution from large coal, gas and nuclear plants. Utility companies are fighting back by joining the shift to renewables, as well as offering customers digital devices to keep closer tabs on their power consumption. As one banker puts it, power companies need to develop a ”Utility 2. 0 strategy” focused on renewables, networks and retail customers. Getting bigger through acquisitions would help utilities manage the transition better, and the impending loss of public subsidies and preferential access to power networks that have cushioned utility revenues is also spurring consolidation. The new rush to merge comes after some tough years. Several utilities had to swallow hefty writedowns after a wave of acquisitions a decade ago as the traditional power generation model, and nuclear power in particular, came under pressure. Now, companies such as Gas Natural and Germany’s RWE ( ) have cleaned up their up balance sheets to make it easy to carry out acquisitions or share swaps, analysts say. ”A lot of mistakes have been made with respect to big ticket M&A in the past. Everyone is keen to avoid new missteps,” said one banker specializing in utility companies.  The Stoxx Eurozone utilities index . SX6E lost as much as 60 percent of its value over the past decade but has rallied strongly in 2017, helped by outages at EDF reactors pushing winter power prices up and a German court declaring a nuclear fuel tax to be illegal, triggering repayments to companies.   Over the past six months, the index has gained more than 15 percent, while the broader index  is 7 percent higher. ”The sector is finally getting to the point where it can move on from a decade of value destruction . .. Confidence around utilities’ sustainable   generation could grow,” said Deutsche Bank in a research note.  GERMANY AT THE HEART Spain may have fired the starting gun but Germany is at the heart of the current takeover speculation. The country’s largest utilities, E. ON ( ) and RWE, have separated their   green energy and retail operations from their struggling centralized power businesses. E. ON has retained the renewables business and put its old power plants in a company called Uniper ( ). RWE, on the other hand, kept its traditional plants and put the green and retail businesses in a new company called Innogy ( ).  But with market capitalizations of about 19 billion euros, E. ON and Innogy are less than half the size of southern European renewable energy giants Enel and Iberdrola ( ) at 56 billion euros and 50 billion euros respectively. The Italian and Spanish firms started their switch to   activities such as solar power and transmission and distribution grids a decade ago.  Activity is heating up in France too, where Engie ( ) Chief Executive Isabelle Kocher is pushing the former monopoly gas utility to focus more on grids and renewables. Several investment banks are trying to engineer a share swap between Engie and RWE which could create a   energy giant, sources said in May.  ”Enel and Engie are really active, analyzing everything. German companies are ready to do a domestic merger, or to be bought by a foreigner,” said one utilities investment banker.  Enel has renewables capacity of 37 gigawatts (GW) of which 27. 4 comes from hydro plants and 6. 5 GW from wind power. Innogy has a green energy capacity of just 3. 7 GW, mainly in wind. ”Everybody is talking to everybody. But there are only few deals which really make sense.   may be one of them. But mainly it’s about smaller asset disposals, about streamlining at times of more competitive markets and increasing cost pressures,” another utilities banker said.      Iberdrola, Europe’s   utility by market value, is working with U. S. investment bank Morgan Stanley to study opportunities while Gas Natural has turned to Citigroup for advice, according to people close to the situation. Enel has repeatedly denied any interest in Innogy and that big deals tend to destroy value. ”All this M&A talk in Europe, it is just cinema,” Enel CEO Francesco Starace told Reuters. Potential bidders are also circling Uniper, bankers say. Finland’s Fortum ( ) is said to be interested in the German company’s Scandinavian assets but may be hesitant to add to its carbon emissions by acquiring Uniper’s coal and gas plants, which account for the bulk of its operations.  Banking sources said Uniper was also a target for Czech rivals CEZ ( ) and EPH, but they cautioned that its 6. 2 billion euro value, boosted by a 70 percent rise in its shares since it was spun off in September, might cool suitors’ ardor. INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS Besides the strategic shifts shaping the sector, demand for deals is also coming from infrastructure funds, insurance companies and pension funds. They are all hunting for assets to generate steady, reliable yields as the low returns from   securities they have traditionally held are making it increasingly difficult for them to fund their liabilities. But rather than buying companies focused on green energy, funds are increasingly buying a minority stake in the renewable energy assets themselves, leaving the developer as the main operator with a majority ownership. BlackRock’s ( ) renewable infrastructure investment platform launched in 2012, for example, now manages more than $4 billion in client assets, mostly wind and solar projects.  Infrastructure funds are among five bidders expected to place binding offers in September for the Italian assets of Gas Natural, which is working with Rothschild on the sale. Funds are also expected to bid for Steag’s municipal heating activities, which the German utility, owned by seven local municipalities, is selling with the help of Rothschild, people close to the matter said.

124322,185685,Deals and warm words flow as Iran president visits Europe,Reuters,Antonella Cinelli and Crispian Balmer,2016-01-26,2016.0,1.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-europe-rouhani-idUSKCN0V31DJ  ," Italy and Iran signed billions of dollars of business deals on Monday at the start of a visit to Europe by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani aimed at rebuilding his nation’s ties with the West after years of economic sanctions. Heading a   delegation of business leaders and ministers, Rouhani will spend two days in Rome before flying to France on Wednesday, looking to polish Tehran’s diplomatic credentials at a time of turmoil in the Middle East. An Italian government source said the Iranians would sign up to 17 billion euros ($18. 4 billion) worth of deals in sectors from energy to infrastructure and from steel to shipbuilding. ”This is just the beginning of a journey. There are sectors where we must work closer together,” Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said, standing alongside Rouhani. ”I am sure this visit will be a fundamental part of our ability to overcome together the challenge of fighting terrorism, atrocity and evil that we all have to confront together,” Renzi added, referring specifically to Islamic State militants, who oppose Iran and the West in equal measure. Rouhani had originally been due to visit Europe in November but canceled the trip after an Islamic State attack on Paris, which killed 130 people.  ”We have always been in the front line against terrorism . .. we have to continue (cooperating with Italy) to secure a genuine peace in Afghanistan, Syria, Lebanon, Libya,” the Iranian president said, speaking through a translator. Many Western nations have accused Iran of funding various militant groups, and despite a landmark nuclear deal between world powers and Tehran last year, the United States is keeping some of its financial sanctions in place because of the alleged links and human rights abuses. This will complicate Iran’s full return to international markets, but judging by the Italian and French businesses lining up to clinch deals there is an enormous appetite in Europe to revive old trade ties and boost the sluggish economy.  ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS     A pragmatist elected in 2013, Rouhani championed the 2015 accord under which Iran curbed its nuclear program in return for the end of U. N. EU and some U. S. sanctions this month. He is anxious to bring Western knowhow and products back home to prove to Iranians that the accord, contested by many hardliners, will help ease their prolonged economic hardships.  Iran announced plans at the weekend to buy more than 160 European planes, mainly from Airbus ( ). Among the deals struck on Monday were a pipeline contract worth between $4 billion and $5 billion for oil services group Saipem ( ) up to 5. 7 billion euros in contracts for Italian steel firm Danieli ( ) and up to 4 billion euros of business for infrastructure firm Condotte d’Acqua. Italian business leaders, including the heads of oil firm Eni ( ) and carmaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ( ) attended a dinner for Rouhani on Monday. At the request of the Iranians, no wine was to be served. France refused the same request so there will be no state dinner for Rouhani in Paris. While Italy was not involved in the prolonged nuclear talks, France was, and it took a hard line toward Tehran in the negotiations. It has also been outspoken in its condemnation of Iran’s support for Syrian President Bashar   and skeptical of the country’s other Middle East interventions. This is likely to make Rouhani’s visit to France later this week more prickly than his stay in Italy. ”Trust needs to be built. It’s like love. It is only the proof of love that counts,” said a senior French diplomat. The boss of oil group Total ( ) Patrick Pouyanne, is among top French executives who are expected to hold    meetings with Rouhani. The Iranian leader is due to address up to 500 Italian business leaders on Tuesday before meeting Pope Francis, who is likely to discuss peace prospects for the Middle East and raise the question of human rights in Iran.

In a complaint filed on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court, Jason Koza said he never allowed his fan art depicting   members to be used in packaging for the   group’s ”Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,” the sole copy of which Shkreli bought. Shkreli has bragged that he had no plans to listen to the album, but bought it to ”keep it from the people.” The    is also known for sparking outrage last year among patients, doctors and politicians after his former company Turing Pharmaceuticals raised the price of the   infection drug Daraprim by more than 5, 000 percent. Koza, 34, of Copiague, New York, said he thought his nine works would appear only on the website WuDisciples. blogspot. com. But the Fashion Institute of Technology graduate now blames   leader Robert ”RZA” Diggs for including them in the ”Shaolin” album, and Shkreli for allowing three works depicting Inspectah Deck, Ol’ Dirty Bastard and Raekwon to accompany a Jan. 29 article at Vice. com. ”Mr. Koza was happy when his work appeared on the website,” the complaint said. ”Mr. Koza never granted a license for his works to be copied or displayed anywhere (else).” Other defendants include Paddle8, which auctioned the album, and Wu   producer Tarik ”Cilvaringz” Azzougarh. Koza said Cilvaringz has acknowledged the infringement, asking in a Jan. 31 email ”if you want to skype discussing the use of your drawings. Thanks bro.” Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Shkreli, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.   did not immediately respond to a similar request.

124966,186664,Islamic State militants kill 17 in Libya’s Sabratha: officials,Reuters,Ahmed Elumami,2016-02-25,2016.0,2.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-sabratha-idUSKCN0VX1AV  ," Islamic State militants briefly entered the center of the western Libyan city of Sabratha, beheading 11 members of local security forces and killing another six in overnight clashes before retreating, local authorities said on Wednesday.  Islamist militants have taken advantage of political chaos and a lack of central authority to establish a presence in Libya, with fighters loyal to Islamic State seizing control in Sirte and staging attacks in several other cities.  The fighting in Sabratha started when local brigades   formerly among the many rebel groups that joined in an uprising that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi in 2011   attacked suspected Islamic State hideouts 15 km (9 miles) south of the city, Sabratha’s municipal council said in a statement. It said the militants then ”took advantage of the security vacuum downtown and spread out all over the city”.  Sabratha’s mayor, Hussein   told Reuters that six members of the local brigades had been killed in clashes on Tuesday evening and 11 more were beheaded when militants entered the security directorate building in the city center overnight before the brigades forced them out. Late on Wednesday the Deterrence force, an armed brigade based in Tripoli that has a   role, said it had arrested three senior Libyan Islamic State members in a suburb of the capital, including Sabratha commander Mohamed Saad Altajouri.    A security source from the western city of Zintan said on Wednesday that authorities had agreed to treat the five wounded brigade members from Sabratha, a sign that Zintan and Sabratha may be prepared to cooperate in the fight against Islamic State. The two cities have been on opposite sides of Libya’s   conflict, with Zintan allied to the internationally recognized government now based in the country’s far east and Sabrathan forces among those that support a rival government whose armed supporters seized the capital Tripoli in 2014. Sabratha mayor Thwadi said local towns and cities including Zawiya and Surman had offered support against Islamic State, and that Sabratha had asked Zintan and two other towns to cut off militants’ supply routes along desert roads.  On Friday, the United States carried out an air strike on a suspected Islamic State training camp on the outskirts of Sabratha, killing nearly 50 people. Serbia’s government said two Serbian diplomats kidnapped in Libya in November also died in the attack.  It was the second U. S. air strike in three months against Islamic State in Libya.

125138,186929,"Forever blowing bubbles, Chinese investors pump Shanghai property",Reuters,Clare Jim and Samuel Shen,2016-03-04,2016.0,3.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-property-idUSKCN0W6001  ," Frenzied property buying in Shanghai has set alarm bells ringing that a new bubble is forming, just months after China’s frothy stock markets crashed, raising fears about a replay of the real estate bust that has hit the country’s growth since 2012. Home prices in the city, China’s biggest financial hub, climbed 3. 6 percent in February from the previous month, according to a survey by CRIC, extending the 17. 5 percent annual gain it recorded in January, which was seven times faster than the country as a whole. The property revival has coincided with investors’ abrupt loss of faith in China’s share markets, which had soared 150 percent in the year to   only to give up fourth fifths of those gains since the summer. ”The (property) market seems crazy again. I have no idea why it’s crazy, but it should be the right time to buy,” said Wang Zhongcai, a    clerk, who was queuing, among many others, to register ownership of a small investment apartment he had bought. From 2005 to 2011, property prices in China soared, buoyed by ready credit, migration into the cities, and government stimulus measures after the global financial crisis. As developers poured money into new builds and unrelated companies set up property arms, residential housing development as a share of economic output tripled in a decade, until government measures to cool the market ended the frenzy. Chastened by the impact of that bust, which left a huge stock of unsold apartments across China and hammered industries supplying construction materials, Beijing has for the last 18 months been trying to soften the blow, cutting interest rates, downpayment requirements and property transaction taxes.   FIRST The government’s principal goal was not to help the bigger cities but the smaller ones where unfinished, abandoned developments remain a very visible reminder of the market failure. But the big cities appear to be drawing the lion’s share of new investment   and warnings from economists. ”In   (cities) the prices are certainly rising too fast. Every time when there are control policies, most resources focus on first tier,” said Lan Shen, Standard Chartered’s China economist in Beijing. ”Going forward the policies will be more aiming at the lower tiers; very selective measures, not   to create a bigger bubble in the first tier,” Lan said. But as China loosens the credit environment to support growth, which slipped to its weakest in 25 years in 2015, speculators are following the investment logic, not Beijing’s goals. ”  cities have a more sophisticated environment (for speculation). Investors see room for prices to rise because there’s a lot of demand yet limited supply,” said Clement Luk, chief executive officer for eastern China at realtor Centaline. He added that Shenzhen, a booming major city in southwest China, was blazing the trail for Shanghai. ”People think since Shenzhen has gone up 50 to 60 percent last year while Shanghai was up only 20 percent, it should be now Shanghai’s turn.” Hong Kong developer Shui On Land ( ) said last month it sold out a new residential development in   Shanghai on the day of launch at an average price of about $1, 140 per square foot. The largest unit was an 1, 800 sq ft apartment that fetched more than $2. 2 million, and the agent said prices would ”definitely go up” when they start selling a new phase of the development in May. Wang Wenwen at real estate agency Sinyi said sellers could see the market heating up and were now playing   with each other in raising prices. An official at Shimao Property ( ) which last October launched a project in a less central part of Shanghai averaging 41, 000 yuan per meter, said the company was planning to raise prices for its new launches this month and next. Shanghai is already trying to alleviate the pressure, issuing new rules last month to increase the supply of small and   apartments. But the history of China’s booms and busts and Beijing’s efforts to cap the highs and cushion the lows has made some investors wary that what goes up too fast comes down as speedily. ”This rally is too crazy,” said a property agent who gave his last name as Xu. ”I own three units in Shanghai and I’m planning to sell them. I think a chill wind is blowing to the   city, and I worry that the government will implement cooling measure soon.”  (Editing by Will Waterman) WASHINGTON New orders for U.

125482,187472,Exclusive: U.N. lifts North Korea sanctions on four ships at China’s request ,Reuters,"Michelle Nichols, Louis Charbonneau and James Pearson",2016-03-22,2016.0,3.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-sanctions-china-usa-exclus-idUSKCN0WN287  ," The U. N. Security Council agreed on Monday to a Chinese request to remove sanctions on four ships the United Nations had blacklisted for ties to Pyongyang’s arms trade. The agreement came after China secured assurances the vessels would not use North Korean crews, a U. S. official said. China asked the United States on March 16 for help removing the ships from the U. N. blacklist, according to a diplomatic cable sent the same day from the U. S. permanent mission at the United Nations to a group of other U. S. embassies. The cable, reviewed by Reuters, showed wrangling between top diplomats from the United States and China over the tough new North Korea sanctions, weeks after Washington had presented a united front with Beijing, Pyongyang’s main ally and trade partner. The U. S. mission at the United Nations declined to comment on the cable or make its ambassador, Samantha Power, available for an interview about the cable. The U. S. Treasury Department, which administers U. S. economic and financial sanctions, also declined to comment.     The removal of the four ships was confirmed in a press release, which was seen by Reuters and will soon be issued by the Security Council, according to U. N. diplomats. While Washington has been the driving force behind the toughening international sanctions regime, China conducts 90 percent of the trade with North Korea and is the key to enforcing them. FOURTH NUCLEAR TEST The ships were among 31 vessels sanctioned by the   council on March 2 because they were linked to Ocean Maritime Management (OMM) a North Korean shipping firm known to transport arms and other illicit goods for the secretive state. ”We discovered that they are not OMM ships,” Chinese U. N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi told Reuters on Monday. ”The basis for the listing of the ships is basically that they belong to OMM, so if you make a mistake, then you correct the mistake.” U. S. and other Western officials have said all the original listings were carefully vetted before the ships were added to the blacklist. That list was appended to the sweeping Security Council resolutions implemented on March 2, following North Korea’s fourth nuclear test in January. The U. S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Security Council committee on North Korea sanctions agreed to the request after China secured written commitments the four ships would no longer use North Korean crews.  The four ships include the Jin Teng, a cargo ship detained by the Philippines days after the sanctions took effect. ”We’re pleased with the outcome,” said the U. S. official. ”It achieved an impact, a real world outcome.” He added it was a sign of a ”productive working relationship with China” on North Korea and that it was ”gratifying to see such instant   effects” of the U. N. sanctions regime. U. S. FRUSTRATION Liu had raised the issue of the four sanctioned vessels last week in a meeting with Power, his U. S. counterpart, according to the cable reviewed by Reuters.  Power approved the unclassified cable, which went from the U. S. mission at the U. N. to American embassies in Manila, Tokyo and Seoul. The cable pointed to American frustration with what U. S. officials characterized as China’s attempts to hold up the routine renewal of a U. N. panel of experts in return for   the ships. The panel is made up of a team of international experts who monitor and research potential breaches of resolutions against North Korea and recommend entities that could be sanctioned. Liu had asked Power’s help in removing the ships from the list in an ”easy, smooth and quick way,”  to get the panel renewed, according to the document’s characterization of Liu’s request. The easiest way, Liu said, ”would be to work quickly to get all these issues settled,” according to the cable.  Power told Liu China’s linking of the issues and attempts to hold up the renewal of the panel was ”not going over well in Washington,” according to the cable, and asked China to let the renewal go forward. ”You don’t need to blackmail us, Power said, as we are indeed interested in operating in good faith,” the cable says of Power’s conversation with Liu. Liu told Reuters on Monday he expected the experts panel would be ”renewed according to the normal procedure in the Security Council”.  (Story refiles to fix Power’s name in 2nd to last paragraph.)

125689,187808,"Brazil’s Rousseff gets relief from Supreme Court, supporters",Reuters,Maria Carolina Marcello and Lisandra Paraguassu,2016-04-01,2016.0,4.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-politics-lula-idUSKCN0WX2L5  ," Brazil’s Supreme Court ruled on Thursday to take a corruption investigation into former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva away from a crusading federal judge, as   protests across the country eased pressure on President Dilma Rousseff. Local television showed tens of thousands of supporters clad in red marching for Rousseff, who has faced growing calls for her impeachment since   judge Sergio Moro released a wiretapped conversation of her and Lula this month. Thursday’s   Supreme Court decision grants Lula and Rousseff a breather from Moro by putting Lula’s case temporarily in the hands of the top court, all but 3 of whose members have been named since the ruling Workers’ Party took office in 2003. Lula, Rousseff’s predecessor and mentor, is under investigation for allegedly benefiting, in the form of payments and a luxury apartment, from a massive graft scheme uncovered at   oil company Petrobras. Rousseff is fighting impeachment over unrelated charges of irregularities in the government budget designed to favor her reelection in 2014. She could lose power as soon as May if she does not gain more support in Congress. The corruption scandal, Rousseff’s Congressional weakness and a deepening economic recession have led to Brazil’s worst political crisis since former President Fernando Collor de Mello resigned to avoid impeachment in 1992. Up to three million people joined a protest in favor of her ouster on March 13, the largest demonstration in decades. On Thursday, Rousseff held a rally with artists and movie stars who support her and said opponents trying to impeach her were merely trying to ”give a democratic tint to a coup.”   Aides said her government had had some success in drawing lawmakers from smaller political parties into her government’s alliance, which was shattered by the departure this month of Brazil’s largest political party the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB). ”The reconfiguration of the base is ongoing,” Rousseff’s spokesman Edinho Silva told journalists. In a sign of a potential split among the PMDB, Senate leader Renan Calheiros said his party’s decision to leave the government was ”foolish” and ”premature.” The lower house of Congress is due to vote in   on whether Rousseff should stand trial in the Senate for manipulating government accounts. She is not being investigated for corruption. Her woes deepened, however, when she tried to appoint Lula to her Cabinet, which would give him some immunity from prosecution because ministers and elected officials can only be tried by the Supreme Court in Brazil. Hours after he was named, Moro released a recording of them discussing the appointment. A Supreme Court justice suspended Lula’s appointment arguing that it was aimed at illegally shielding him. On Thursday, the Supreme Court overruled Moro’s decision to release the recording of his call with Rousseff and said it was the only court authorized to wiretap a conversation involving the president. Several justices said the conversation should not be accepted as valid evidence when the court eventually makes a decision on whether Lula can join the cabinet. Moro could still take some parts of the Lula investigation, depending on future Supreme Court rulings and whether Lula is ultimately allowed to become a minister. Lula released a video on social media praising Thursday’s protests and gathering of artists, saying the ” ” movement was growing.

125821,187993,Inversion rules will hit boutique M&A advisors hardest,Reuters,Philip Scipio,2016-04-07,2016.0,4.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-allergan-idUSKCN0X32K5  ," (Refiles this April 6 story to correct fee and league table data throughout. Removes reference to Dow Chemical merger as inversion trade.) By Philip Scipio NEW YORK (IFR)   Boutique advisory firms will lose out on millions of dollars in fees if the U. S. Treasury Department’s latest proposed rules on   corporate mergers causes more M&A deals to fall apart. The clamp down   aimed at curbing deals in which companies move overseas to cut taxes   threw a number of corporate mergers into question this week, and pushed Pfizer to cancel its $160 billion acquisition of Botox maker Allergan. Around $600 million in fees are at stake if all seven pending inversion deals, including the proposed $16. 5 billion merger of Johnson Controls with   Tyco International, are also canceled in the wake of the Treasury’s plans, according to Freeman Consulting. Although that $600 million represents only a fraction   2 percent   of the total fees collected by M&A advisory firms last year and excludes fees bankers would still collect even if deals fall apart, it makes up a large part of the overall M&A fees earned by boutique firms last year. The league table rankings of firms like Lazard and Centerview Partners surged last year after some won advisory positions on a number of high profile deals. Guggenheim scored a coup advising Pfizer.  ”Boutiques in particular have been winning market share, getting on 70 percent of U. S.$10   deals in the US last year,” said Jeffrey Nassof at Freeman.  Shares of boutique firms took a hit in the aftermath of the Treasury’s plans   which took market participants by complete surprise   and their league table rankings could now be under threat. In the first quarter Lazard ranked ninth among M&A advisers, according to Thomson Reuters data   but its position would drop to 12th excluding pending inversion deals. Centerview, which is not publicly traded, would drop off the list of top advisers excluding inversion deals from 17th in the same scenario. Evercore would gain a spot, moving to 22nd. Among the bulge and bracket banks, Barclays would slip to ninth from seventh place in the quarter.  Given the sheer volume of deals in 2015 the league table would be unaffected if inversion deals were excluded. ”The boutique firms are more exposed to anything negative concerning M&A, and inversion deals have been some of the larger deals in the last several years,” said Morningstar analyst Michael Wong.      BIG LOSSES If all pending inversion trades are undone, it would also hurt top advisors like Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs who stand to lose $100 million, $90 million and $80 million of fees respectively, Freeman said. Guggenheim and Lazard, meanwhile, face $65 million and $60 million in lost fees respectively. The advisors for Allergan   Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan   were expected to share $142 million in fees, according to data from Freeman. The advisors to Pfizer   Guggenheim Securities, Goldman Sachs, Centerview and Moelis   were set to share a total $94 million in fees.  But the big banks, which have more diversified global businesses, may not feel the sting quite as much as the small boutique firms. Goldman earned $2. 8 billion in fees from M&A last year, while Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan earned $2 billion and $1. 8 billion respectively. Lazard earned $900 million and Guggenheim $200 million, according to Freeman. Goldman topped the global M&A table in 2015, having advised on 415 deals including three inversion deals with Allergan among them   valued at roughly $1. 737 trillion. Excluding inversion deals, Goldman would have remained atop the league table followed by Morgan Stanley, which advised on three inversion deals, and JP Morgan, which advised on four.    Goldman also led the table in the first quarter 2016, followed by JP Morgan   and those positions would not be altered if tax inversion trades were excluded. It looks tough though for all involved in this business because the Treasury proposals come at a time when competition to win advisory positions in a lukewarm M&A environment has intensified this year. The number of global M&A deals fell nearly 10 percent   while the total value dropped 18 percent to $699 billion in the first quarter, compared to the year ago quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. ”It’s (Q1) going to be a brutal quarter and this doesn’t help sentiment at all,” said Chris Wheeler, an analyst at Atlantic Securities in London.

Market jitters and poor   share performances had scared investors away from buying into any sizable offerings.  Red Rock priced 27. 25 million shares at $19. 50, the middle of its previously indicated $18 to $21 range, according to a statement.  Red Rock, which operates resorts and casinos such as Red Rock, Green Valley Ranch and Palace Station, is the second gaming company to go public this year. Earlier this month, real estate investment trust MGM Growth Properties LLC raised $1. 05 billion in its initial public offering.  MGM Growth owns a portfolio of casino resort properties, including Mandalay Bay and the Mirage, carved out of MGM Resorts International. While both companies have benefited from a healthier Las Vegas economy, Red Rock’s casinos cater more to locals. Las Vegas, which was hit notably hard by the 2008 recession, has stabilized since its 2012 lows. Housing prices, which plummeted 60 percent from 2006 to 2012, have since rebounded. Red Rock is primarily owned by brothers Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, who took the company private in 2007 in a deal valued at $5. 4 billion. At the time, the company operated under the name Station Casinos.  Station Casinos filed for bankruptcy in 2009, under the burden of debt from the leveraged buyout and a struggling Las Vegas economy. It emerged from bankruptcy in 2011 with the Fertitta brothers retaining control. Proceeds from the IPO will go largely to the Fertitta family. Red Rock has total debt of roughly $2. 2 billion.  Red Rock is scheduled to list its shares on Wednesday on the Nasdaq under the ticker ”RRR.”  Deutsche Bank Securities, J. P Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs & Co are among the underwriters for the offering.

126275,188696,Fed’s ’forward guidance’ shift leaves markets more wedded to data,Reuters,Howard Schneider and Ann Saphir,2016-04-27,2016.0,4.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-guidance-analysis-idUSKCN0XO2U5  ," Rising oil prices and a more stable Chinese economy allowed the Federal Reserve to shift its focus back to the home front on Wednesday, as it signaled that U. S. jobs and inflation data would determine whether it hiked interest rates in June.    The U. S. central bank gave little hint of how it was leaning in the wake of its latest policy meeting, issuing a statement free of the   guidance it has used to massage expectations in markets and within the public.   A previous reference to global economic risks, generally seen as a red light for any rate hike, was dropped from the statement in what appeared to be an attempt to coax investors back onto a diet of U. S. economic data. That is something Fed Chair Janet Yellen and other policymakers have been trying to do for months. In a note issued after the Fed announced it had kept rates unchanged, Barclays analysts said the central bank now ”desires maximum optionality” that will allow it to hike rates at its next meeting in June without having to strongly signal it will do so. ”The Fed was trying to walk a very fine line. They wanted to leave June open . .. But they don’t want it to be a 100 percent (certainty) either,” said Don Ellenberger, a senior portfolio manager with Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. The Fed’s focus moving ahead will be on employment, economic growth, and perhaps most importantly whether inflation begins to show any evidence of increasing from its current low level to the central bank’s 2 percent target.  Since last year, Yellen has tried to push a ” ” approach in which investors and households develop their sense of Fed policy from the performance of the economy, rather than through central bank statements. Investors currently put the chances of a June rate hike at just more than 20 percent, meaning the Fed may go more than half a year between its rate hike last December   the first in nearly a decade   and the next one. That is a glacial pace. ”Whether the Fed ends up hiking in June depends on a continued gradual improvement in the labor market and wage expectations, together with relative economic and financial calm internationally,” said Mohamed   chief economic adviser at Allianz. WEDDED TO DATA The Fed on Wednesday also did not to refer to the   balance of risks that lay before the economy. That assessment, a staple of previous statements, has broadly signaled whether policymakers felt the economic landscape was likely to improve or worsen. It could also point to a rate move. The Fed removed the reference earlier this year because policymakers felt the uncertainty surrounding China, oil prices and other global events had clouded their ability to make a definitive statement.  Its continued exclusion leaves markets even further wedded to the flow of data. Some Fed officials have suggested they would like to keep it that way. San Francisco Fed President John Williams told reporters in March that while investors were looking for ”powerful signs” of the way policy was headed, it was hard to communicate that succinctly. ”Trying to put a balance of risks up, neutral or down, is kind of like thumbs up or thumbs down . .. The world is far more complicated,” he said. Jon Faust, a former Fed adviser who is now an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University, agreed with Williams and described the balance of risks language as ”woefully inadequate for characterizing the situation” and ”subject to misinterpretation”. ”I hope it doesn’t come back,” Faust said.

N said on Wednesday its board unanimously rejected Gannett Co Inc’s ( ) unsolicited takeover offer and will proceed instead with a strategic plan to revive its print business and tap growth in digital content. Tribune shares fell by more than 4 percent after closing at $11. 02 and Gannett’s stock dropped about 13 percent after closing at $16. 27, in   trading. Last month, Gannett, the owner of USA Today, made a takeover bid for Tribune at $12. 25 per share in cash, in a deal worth roughly $815 million.. Tribune owns the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune newspapers, as well as metro dailies like the Orlando Sentinel. In a letter on Wednesday, Tribune told Gannett’s management that its board had reviewed the bid and decided that ”the price reflected in the proposal understates the company’s true value and is not in the best interests of our shareholders.” It does not warrant ”further discussion,” the company said in a statement. Tribune’s rejection of Gannett’s proposal, comes as the newspaper industry tackles declining circulation, high costs, shrinking advertising dollars and a broad shift toward digital content, leaving publishers rushing to consolidate or find new avenues of growth. Gannett, in response, said in a statement on Wednesday it was committed to pursuing a deal and ”intends to solicit withhold votes in order to advance shareholders.”    In a statement on Monday, Gannett Chief Executive Robert Dickey urged Tribune shareholders to withhold their votes for board nominees during Tribune’s June 2 annual meeting and send a ”clear message” to Tribune’s board to engage seriously.  Gannett has been on a mission to buy rivals to create a more efficient company by expanding its footprint into more cities. ”Gannett is best positioned to advance Tribune’s publications and journalism as Gannett’s strategy to grow the USA TODAY NETWORK would seamlessly extend to Tribune,” Dickey said in Gannett’s statement. Tribune Publishing said its board believes that its new plan, which includes driving revenue from content brands, growing the Los Angeles Times as a global brand and embracing a digital strategy will ”generate shareholder value in excess of Gannett’s opportunistic proposal.” Gannett’s claims that its offer was not taken seriously by Tribune are ”misleading,” Tribune Chief Executive Justin Dearborn said on an earnings call with analysts on Wednesday. Gannett said in its statement that Tribune’s board continues to deny it access to due diligence that could help to improve its offer.

Asked what President Barack Obama first told British Prime Minister David Cameron when they spoke by telephone on Friday after the vote result was announced, Rice replied: ”Bummer.” She added that the two leaders had talked through the potential outcomes of the vote on several occasions both in April when Obama visited Britain and urged a ”remain” vote, and at a G7 summit in Japan in late May.  ”In addition to a discussion about the consequences of the vote and conveying our respect for the will of the British people, it was also an opportunity for the president to underscore how much he appreciated David Cameron as a partner and as a friend,” she said. ”It’s obviously a painful occasion when a partner that close experiences a loss that profound.” Obama and Cameron will work closely together during Cameron’s remaining time in office and will also meet at an upcoming NATO summit in Warsaw in July.

The U. S. Labor Department will release its monthly report Friday and investors are anxiously anticipating the data after May’s disappointing number called into question the strength of the American job market. Thursday’s ADP national employment report showed that 172, 000 jobs were added in the private sector in June, surpassing economists’ expectation of 159, 000. ADP data showed private payrolls rose 168, 000 in May, but the government’s nonfarm payrolls data that month reported a gain of only 38, 000 jobs, the smallest since September 2010. Emerging market stocks . MSCIEF were buoyed by the robust U. S. data as well as signals that even with strong job growth, there was little chance the Federal Reserve would raise U.

127706,191003,Morgan Stanley charged with running unethical sales contests: regulator,Reuters,Svea Herbst-Bayliss,2016-10-03,2016.0,10.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-morganstanley-massachusetts-idUSKCN1231KD  ," Morgan Stanley was charged with ”dishonest and unethical conduct” by Massachusetts’ top securities regulator on Monday for having pushed its brokers to sell loans to their clients. Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin alleges that the bank ran   sales contests in Massachusetts and Rhode Island where brokers could earn thousands of dollars for selling   ”securities based loans.” (SBLs) The contests, designed to boost business, were officially prohibited by Morgan Stanley but turned out to be lucrative for the bank with the pace of loan origination tripling and adding $24 million in new loan balances, Galvin said. The charges against Morgan Stanley come one month after Wells Fargo was fined for fraudulently opening accounts and illustrate how large banks are facing increasing scrutiny over their sales practices. Securities based loans let clients borrow against the value of their investment accounts but involve certain risks including the bank’s ability to sell securities to repay the loan. Morgan Stanley said the complaint has no merit and that the company plans to defend itself vigorously. ”The   loan accounts were opened only after discussing the product with each client and obtaining their affirmative consent,” spokesman James Wiggins said in a statement. But Galvin charges that Morgan Stanley executives were slow in discovering the improper sales contests, failed to shut them down immediately, and downplayed the risk associated with the SBLs.  ”This complaint lays bare the culture at Morgan Stanley that bred the high pressure effort to cross sell banking products to its brokerage customers without regard for the fiduciary duty owed to the investor,” Galvin said in a statement. The practice of    —   or getting customers to buy products and services from a range of business lines  —   is common across the banking industry. But the scandal involving Wells Fargo has raised questions about whether it is appropriate to set aggressive sales targets for employees, and whether customers really need all the products they are being offered. Thirty financial advisers working in five Morgan Stanley offices from Springfield, Massachusetts to Providence, Rhode Island joined in the contest that began in January, 2014, Galvin said. The incentives were: $1, 000 for 10 loans, $3, 000 for 20 loans, and $5, 000 for 30 loans, Galvin said, adding that  performance was closely tracked by supervisors. Four years ago the bank shifted the way its advisers are paid, rewarding them for growing assets and loans.  Morgan Stanley’s internal rules prohibited such contests, Galvin said, adding it took the bank’s compliance and risk office until December 2014 to detect the contest and that it was not stopped until April, 2015, Galvin said. At Wells employees opened as many as 2 million fake accounts in customers’ names without their permission, saying they were under intense pressure to meet internal sales quotas. In the aftermath of the settlement and harsh questions from lawmakers, Wells has since suspended those quotas.  The San   bank is now facing probes from authorities ranging from the Department of Justice to the Department of Labor, as well as lawsuits from customers and former employees.

127750,191069,Mylan to pay $465 million over EpiPen Medicaid rebate dispute,Reuters,Deena Beasley,2016-10-08,2016.0,10.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-nl-epipen-idUSKCN1272DZ?il=0  ,"Mylan has been lambasted by consumers and lawmakers for raising prices on the lifesaving EpiPen sixfold to over $600 for a package of two in less than a decade, making the devices unaffordable for a growing number of families. Lawmakers were trying to determine whether Mylan made more money on EpiPen than warranted from state Medicaid programs by having it classified as a generic product, resulting in much smaller rebates to the government health plans. Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch was grilled by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for the price increase and they were skeptical of her profit analysis of the product. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in response to a request from U. S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, said this week that the Medicaid plan for the poor spent $797 million on EpiPen between 2011 and 2015, including rebates provided by Mylan, or $960 million before rebates. Lawmakers have contended that Mylan underpaid Medicaid rebates by misclassifying EpiPen as a generic instead of a branded drug. The Medicaid rebate for a generic is 13 percent compared with a minimum 23. 1 percent for a branded drug. ”I am glad the Department of Justice pursued this so quickly,” Klobuchar said in a statement. ”If other drugs are misclassified, and surely EpiPen isn’t the only one . .. the taxpayers need to get their money back.” Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut blasted the settlement as too small and said Congress should investigate whether Mylan violated the law. ”This settlement is a shadow of what it should be   lacking real accountability for Mylan’s apparent lawbreaking,” he said in a statement. Mylan said in a regulatory filing on Friday that EpiPen will be classified as a branded drug as of April 1, 2017. Bresch told lawmakers this week that Mylan plans to launch a $300 generic version of EpiPen as soon as possible this year. Mylan also lowered its 2016 earnings outlook, but the drugmaker affirmed its 2018 forecast and its shares rose 11 percent to $39. 90 after hours. ”Kudos to management for fast action,” AB Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said in a video message to investors. ”This was one of the major risks everyone was focusing on . .. now it is essentially off the table.” Mylan said it will record a pretax charge of about $465 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30. The company, which will make the payment to the Department of Justice and other government agencies, said the settlement does not include any finding of wrongdoing. Mylan, citing changes to the EpiPen consumer discount program and upcoming launch of a generic version, said it now expects   2016 adjusted earnings per share of $4. 70 to $4. 90, down from $4. 85 to $5. 15. Mylan said it ”remains committed” to its target of at least $6. 00 in adjusted earnings per share in 2018.

128447,192420,Google formally rejects EU antitrust charges,Reuters,Foo Yun Chee,2016-11-03,2016.0,11.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-google-antitrust-idUSKBN12Y1Z8  ," Google ( ) on Thursday formally rejected European Union antitrust charges of unfairly promoting its shopping service and blocking rivals in online search advertising, paving the way for EU regulators to rule next year on these issues and potentially impose hefty fines. The U. S. technology giant’s rebuttal in the shopping case came six years after the European Commission opened an investigation prompted by complaints from rivals such as Microsoft ( ) and a host of European and U. S. rivals. The EU regulator followed up with an   charge against the company in April last year and added more evidence in July this year. It also issued a separate charge sheet against its online search advertising product AdSense for Search at the same time. Google’s general counsel Kent Walker said on a blog that the accusations had no factual, legal or economic basis, and that the company’s actions were driven by its users rather than any plan to squash rivals. ”We never compromised the quality or relevance of the information we displayed. On the contrary, we improved it. That isn’t ’favoring’   that’s listening to our customers,” Walker said. He said the Commission had failed to take into account competition from Amazon ( ) merchant platforms, social media sites, mobile web and online advertising by companies such as Facebook ( ) and Pinterest. The EU executive said it had received Google’s response. ”In each case, we will carefully consider Google’s response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation,” Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said in an email. Google may find it difficult convincing the EU regulator with its latest arguments, said Michael Carrier, professor at New   Rutgers Law School. ”Google has a point that its search results help consumers by allowing them to directly buy the item. But the Commission worries about the effect on rivals. This likely will outweigh the consumer point,” he said. Google also rejected a Commission proposal which would let the company charge rivals for displaying their services prominently, with the amount corresponding to its operating cost or a nominal amount based on the lowest reserve price for AdWords which is currently 0. 01 euro per click. In the advertising case, the company said it had already scrapped the exclusivity clauses and other provisions identified by the regulator as  . The Commission plans to hand down hefty fines to Google if found guilty of breaching EU rules, the charge sheet seen by Reuters showed. The penalty could reach $7. 4 billion or 10 percent of the company’s global turnover for each case. Walker said Google would respond in the coming days to a third EU charge of using its Android mobile operating system to hinder competitors. The Commission has given it until Nov. 11 to do so.

128573,192676,"India abolishes larger banknotes in fight against graft, ’black money’",Reuters,Neha Dasgupta and Nidhi Verma,2016-11-09,2016.0,11.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-modi-corruption-idUSKBN1331WT  ," Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced that 500 and 1, 000 rupee banknotes would be withdrawn from circulation at midnight to crack down on rampant corruption and counterfeit currency. The surprise move was designed to bring billions of dollars worth of cash in unaccounted wealth into the mainstream economy, as well as hit the finances of militants who target India and are suspected of using fake 500 rupee notes to fund operations. ”Black money and corruption are the biggest obstacles in eradicating poverty,” Modi said in a hastily convened address to the nation after a cabinet meeting. Nearly 40 percent of India’s economy is driven by   and   enterprises that largely run on cash transactions. Economists said the move could impact these businesses, and in turn have a   effect on economic growth. There was concern among members of the public about changing larger denomination banknotes for new ones once they expired. Around a dozen people lined up to use an ICICI cash deposit machine in suburban Mumbai soon after the announcement, trying to deposit bundles of 500 and 1, 000 rupee notes. The machine stopped working after 10 minutes. Only two customers managed to deposit their money, and a security guard informed the rest that the cash dispenser has reached its limit and would not accept any more. Delhi taxi driver Anu Choudhury said his boss called to say he should not accept 500 or 1, 000 rupee notes from customers. ”This is not a good step for business. The prime minister did not think about people like us.” BIG MONEY OUTFLOWS Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party came into power in 2014 promising to bring black market money into the regular financial system, but critics said it had failed, with government data showing the cash economy outpacing the formal economy. A report by     Global Financial Integrity estimated that India lost $344 billion in illicit fund outflows between 2002 and 2011. The finance ministry said India would introduce new banknotes of 500 and 2, 000 rupees from Nov. 10. The old notes can be deposited in banks and post offices from Nov. 10 to Dec. 30. All cash machines will be closed on Wednesday and Thursday. The head of the Reserve Bank of India, Urjit Patel, said he saw no impact on liquidity in the wholesale market and that the bank had ramped up production of the new series of notes over the last few months. Modi said militants operating against India were using fake versions of the 500 rupee note, worth about $7. 50 at current exchange rates. ”Terrorism is a frightening thing . .. But have you ever thought about how these terrorists get their money? Enemies from across the border have run their operations using fake currency notes. This has been going on for years,” Modi said. India accuses its neighbor Pakistan of harboring militants who have launched attacks on its troops, particularly in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir which both countries claim. Pakistan denies the accusations. CAUGHT BY SURPRISE Some officials and experts said Tuesday’s move was the biggest in decades aimed at fighting graft. ”It is like a surgical strike on black money,” said Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia. But the head of a   bank said it was not fully prepared for the change.  ”This is news for us also. I’m not aware how much stock we have in our chest. The Reserve Bank will have to provide us with required cash to meet the demand. The demand will be very high no doubt,” said the bank chief, who did not want to be named as he was still awaiting details. Government data show circulation of current notes has outpaced the expansion in India’s economy. In the past five years, circulation of all currency notes grew 40 percent, compared with 30 percent growth in Asia’s   economy. The growth in 500 and 1, 000 rupee banknotes was even steeper; 500 rupee notes grew 76 percent between 2011 and 2016, while in the same period, 1, 000 rupee notes rose by 109 percent. The head of the country’s largest   lender, State Bank of India, said she had just been advised about the government’s decision. ”We have handled demonetisation earlier and will do so again. Tomorrow banks will remain closed in order to withdraw these notes from counters and ATMs. We will strive to restock ATMs at the earliest and make them operational,” said chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya.

Rauner, a Republican, and his wife, Diana, paid federal taxes of $51. 6 million and $6. 9 million in state taxes in 2015. Of the total income, $169. 5 million was from capital gains, though no details were released on the source of those profits. ”I believe as the good book says to whom much has been given from whom much is expected in return,” Rauner said at a news conference when asked about his tax returns. Rauner, who has led a fight against Democrats controlling Illinois’ legislature in the country’s   state fiscal impasse, and his wife contributed $21. 7 million individually to various Illinois political campaigns this year to weaken Democratic control of the state legislature and dislodge the state’s   budget stalemate, campaign records show. Illinois has not had a full operating budget for 17 months. Republicans netted four seats in the Illinois House and two seats in the state Senate in Tuesday’s elections, but Democrats retained control of both legislative chambers and defeated Rauner’s choice for comptroller. A separate filing from Rauner’s family’s foundation showed $53. 6 million in assets at the end of 2015 and $11. 6 million in charitable giving for the year. In 2014, Rauner and his wife reported $58. 3 million in earnings. Because the Rauners’ assets are in a blind trust, an aide said the couple is ”screened from all financial decisions” and cannot explain the increase in their income. A spokesman for Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan  declined comment on the governor’s earnings, but a top Madigan ally said Rauner’s wealth puts him out of touch with the electorate. “I don’t know how he can claim to ever understand the problems of regular, ordinary Illinoisans,” said Democratic Representative Lou Lang.

128968,193429,"Five years after the boom, battle rages over mining wages in Australia",Reuters,Jonathan Barrett and Aaron Bunch,2016-11-22,2016.0,11.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-economy-wages-idUSKBN13H2JZ?il=0  ," Coal prices may be recovering, but there are no celebrations in the mining town of Collie, Western Australia, where workers are fighting Indian conglomerate Lanco Infratech ( ) over plans to slash their wages almost in half.  The move to cut pay at Lanco’s Griffin Coal mine comes five years after the peak of a commodity price boom that saw miners, truck drivers and even cleaners earning   incomes in Australia’s remote outback mines and offshore oil and gas fields.  But unwinding the wage hikes has proved difficult after a collapse in prices for coal, iron ore and other resources pushed dozens of mining companies into bankruptcy and many more to the brink.  Lanco’s move to switch from an   wage agreement to statutory minimum pay when the agreement expired is among the first of its kind and has quickly become a national test case.     China’s Yanzhou Coal Mining Co ( ) and U. S. giant Exxon Mobil Corp ( ) are among other companies pursuing controversial changes to wages and conditions.     While lower wages will help struggling projects survive, some economists worry widespread cuts to worker incomes will weigh on consumer spending and economic growth. Australian wages are growing at their slowest pace on record, the Australian Bureau of Statistics data for the September quarter shows, representing less than half the wage growth rate workers enjoyed a decade ago. Workers in Collie believe the wage cuts will have devastating consequences for their   town of about 7, 000 residents. Graham Latham, who retired from Griffin Coal in July because he was unhappy with the new pay rate and job conditions, said businesses including a hardware store, camera shop and fashion boutique have already shut their doors.    ”When I first started at out there it felt like a family atmosphere, but now you just feel like a number, you know? ,” he said.  WAGE RECLAIM A KPMG report for lobby group the Australian Mines and Metals Association (AMMA) has found wages in the iron ore industry are 20 percent higher in Australia than in competing jurisdictions, and offshore vessel operators are paid    times more. During the boom time, miners regularly paid dump truck drivers high six figure salaries, while travel arrangements allowed some workers to live in holiday areas such as the Indonesian island of Bali during their breaks.  Nicholas Ellery, partner in legal firm Corrs Chambers Westgarth, said the severity of the wage cuts was a result of these high wages and incentives many people enjoyed in stronger economic times. ”Businesses are just trying to find ways to survive and stay viable,” Ellery said. ”This is happening across sectors and while industries are doing it tough, we’ll see more of it.” Companies including Fortescue Metals Group ( ) have changed shift rosters, and penny pinching   from cutting back on soap and bottled water at mines   has become commonplace. Still around 46, 000 mining construction jobs were lost between 2013 and 2015, according to National Australia Bank data.    Coal prices have surged this year but projects run by Lanco and Yanzhou’s local arm, also in Collie, operate on    contracts and have yet to see higher prices feed through.  Griffin has lost an average A$48. 9 million ($36. 2 million) a year since 2011, according to court filings. ”There is a significant gap between the cost of production and the income received for selling each tonne of coal,” Griffin’s chief financial controller James Riordan told Reuters. ”Labor costs are by far the biggest cost of production.”    A spokesman for Yanzhou’s local coal operations said the company had been negotiating since early last year without success.  ”The proposed 15 percent reduction is unfortunately reflective of the difficult economic and operating conditions we are continuing to address at this time,” the spokesman said in a statement. COMPANIES IN BOX SEAT   Lanco’s successful bid in Australia’s industrial relations tribunal to return workers to an industry minimum has set a  precedent that other companies are now holding over their work forces during negotiations, said unionist Steve McCartney.   ”Companies think this is a green light to attack wages and conditions for workers all over Australia,” said McCartney. ”Our people in Collie are digging in.”  Some Griffin maintenance workers are facing a potential pay cut from around A$130, 000 a year to A$80, 000, although negotiations with the company are ongoing. Exxon Mobil subsidiary Esso wants to move workers at its oil platform operations in the Bass Strait fields, south of Australia’s mainland, from       shifts, to   shifts designed to improve productivity. It has started proceedings to move workers onto award wages although an agreement could be reached in the interim. An Esso spokesman declined to comment.  Jane Beauglehole, a   resident of Collie and wife of a worker at Lanco’s operations, said industry minimum wages would affect all aspects of family life. ”Work is saying, ’We’ve got counselors you can use, come use them’,” said Beauglehole. ”And I say, ’a workforce shouldn’t need counselors to help the workers because it should be a happy place to work in’.” ($1 = 1. 3524 Australian dollars)  (Editing by Lincoln Feast) U.

129122,193751,’Viva Fidel!’: Tens of thousands pay last respects to Cuba’s Castro,Reuters,Nelson Acosta and Sarah Marsh,2016-11-29,2016.0,11.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-castro-idUSKBN13N0BF?il=0  ," Tens of thousands of Cubans, some wrapped in red, white and blue national flags, paid final respects in Havana on Monday to Fidel Castro, who led a leftist revolution, ruled for half a century and resisted the United States throughout the Cold War. Castro died on Friday at the age of 90, a decade after stepping down due to poor health and ceding power to his brother Raul Castro. While he had been retired as an active leader, his death removed any impediment on his brother to pursue deeper relations with Washington if U. S.   Donald Trump warms to the idea of improved ties.  Castro was admired by leftists and people of the developing world who saw him as a revolutionary champion of the poor, but he was vilified by many who viewed him as a dictator who oppressed Cubans and ruined the economy through socialism. ”Long live Fidel! We can hear him, we can feel him, he’ll always be here,” a crowd gathered near Havana’s Revolution Square chanted, holding up a banner that read ”We are Fidel”. The government invited people to the square for a   commemoration that started with a   salute heard throughout much of the capital. Thousands queued in snaking lines to walk past a portrait of a young Fidel dressed in military fatigues, with a rifle and pack slung over his back. Raul Castro and his top lieutenants held a separate, private ceremony, where they signed a book in front of an identical portrait, and laid white flowers.  While some world leaders have sent admiring messages of condolence, Castro has been condemned by critics, including Trump, who in a weekend statement called him ”a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people.” Before Castro’s death, Trump had threatened to reverse President Barack Obama’s rapprochement with Cuba, which has included restoring diplomatic ties, increasing trade and pressing the U. S. Congress to end years of economic embargo. The Republican Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, reiterated that on Monday, saying in a Twitter message he would end the U. S. ”deal” with Cuba if the government in Havana did not reciprocate with ”a better deal for the Cuban people.” He did not give details of what this might entail. Castro was cremated on Saturday and the government has declared a   period of mourning. His ashes will be carried in a cortege to a final resting place in Santiago de Cuba, the city in eastern Cuba where he launched the revolution. While many Cubans have reported a certain pressure to attend the government’s many staged events and Castro was hated by many who fled for Miami, he was also widely loved and people appeared to shed genuine tears on Monday.       ”I’m devastated because it’s as if my own father had died, he was like my second father. Everything we have, my education as a doctor, it’s thanks to him,” said Maria del Carmen, 57, who had been standing in line since before dawn, and who gave only her first name. Some people arrived as early as 4 a. m. to be at the head of one of three lines of mourners entering a square that has been central to Cuba’s recent history, and where Castro gave many of his rousing, lengthy speeches. Among the mourners was Belkis Meireles, a    civil engineer who arrived two hours before the start. ”I am very sad. I came to pay homage to our father, friend, commander,” Meireles said in a hushed voice. ”He was a man who freed us and sent doctors and teachers everywhere around the world.” Political opponents stayed away or kept quiet, allowing admirers to say goodbye to a man who elevated the island to the world stage during the Cold War by forging a   state just 90 miles (145 km) from Florida and then resisting Washington’s long efforts to force change. ”He wasn’t perfect. Nobody is,” said Roberto Videaux, a    retiree who was nonetheless proud of Castro. ”Fidel was a teacher, a patriot.” OBAMA’S DETENTE THREATENED After decades fighting what he termed the ”empire to the north,” Castro was distrustful about the rapprochement his brother achieved with Obama, publicly expressing his reservations in columns published in the Communist Party newspaper. Obama, a Democrat, began the opening to Washington’s old Cold War foe after he won his second term in office, and has brought about his policy change through executive actions, including allowing scheduled commercial airline flights.  A scheduled flight from the United States landed in Havana on Monday for the first time in more than 50 years: an American Airlines plane that made the hop from Miami. Scheduled service from U. S. airports to the Cuban provinces restarted in August. The only   stock fund in the United States rallied more than 13 percent Monday, a sign investors expect detente to prosper despite Trump´s rhetoric. Given Castro was no longer in office and the mixed feelings  abroad over his legacy, Tuesday’s ceremony in Havana attracted only a scattering of world leaders, mainly from Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin would not attend as he was preparing for a major speech, while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was also skipping after warm comments he made about Castro triggered a backlash.  Brazilian President Michel Temer was also not attending. But Robert Mugabe, the    president of Zimbabwe, was expected to arrive, as was Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. North Korea called for three days of mourning and said it would keep flags at half mast to honor Castro, its state news agency said. Cuba’s rich variety of music, a soundtrack on the streets of Havana, has been muted since Friday night and the government has also temporarily banned alcohol sales and suspended the professional baseball season.

129267,193991,Actelion’s silence has hedge funds betting big on J&J deal,Reuters,Maiya Keidan and John Miller,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-actelion-m-a-hedgefunds-idUSKBN13R22F  ," Actelion’s silence speaks volumes to the dozens of   hedge funds piling into the Swiss biotech firm, betting that Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J) ( ) approach will result in an outright takeover and handsome returns.  A source familiar with the matter has told Reuters the two companies are discussing a bid of close to $27 billion, or 250 Swiss francs ($248) per share, which is 25 percent above Actelion’s current share price.  Both companies have confirmed that U. S. diversified healthcare group J&J   maker of Pizbuin sun screen, surgical tools and arthritis drug Remicade   has approached Actelion about a potential takeover, but kept mum on details.    and Chief Executive   Clozel and fellow shareholder Rudolf Maag have in the past been outspoken defenders of an independent Actelion, which has built a $2 billion business by focusing on a debilitating lung disease.  But they have made no public comment since the companies confirmed the talks a week ago, and Clozel would have some explaining to do if he rejected an offer with such a big premium, fund managers with a more conventional investment approach told Reuters. ”This time it’s different. It has not been outright rejected. That’s an indication that you can go a little bit bigger,” said Michael Wegener, managing partner at Hong     hedge fund Case Equity Partners. He has staked 1 percent of his fund’s net assets under management on Actelion, but did not disclose the size of his assets, and is prepared to stock up if J&J tables a more detailed takeover proposal. ”We don’t think Clozel is going to fight,” said another hedge fund manager, who asked not to be named.  Clozel holds about 5 percent in the biotech firm, according to its annual report, while his wife Martine Clozel,   and chief scientific officer, also owns an undisclosed stake. No detailed data is available on share purchases by   funds   who typically go after deal targets available for a discount to a mooted takeover offer   but Reuters journalists have been in contact with scores of fund managers who have discussed their tactics. Daily turnover in Actelion shares has on average jumped more than fourfold since media reports of a J&J approach emerged on Nov. 24, from their   average.  The shares were trading at 200 francs as of 1603 GMT on Friday, up 27 percent since Nov. 24.    OFFER Many investors are counting on J&J to structure a deal that would grant shareholders a cash payout and award Clozel a   departure that honors the value of the firm’s development pipeline of experimental drugs.  Some analysts argue J&J, or any rival suitor, will pay up for Actelion’s launched products   two new drugs alone are seen generating combined peak sales of well above $4 billion   but have little appreciation for its drug development projects.  Analysts at brokerage Brian Garnier on Friday suggested Clozel could be offered to keep control of the experimental drugs portfolio and cash in on the rest.   ”A   Actelion going forward would therefore consist of a pipeline company with limited or no revenues.”  Rudolf Maag, another linchpin investor, who according to Thomson Reuters data holds 5. 1 percent, has previous ties to J&J: he made much of his near $2 billion fortune when he sold his stake in medical device maker   to J&J four years ago. Maag declined to comment this week, a departure from five years ago when he and Clozel defended Actelion against an attempt by U. S.  hedge fund Elliott Advisors to get the biotech firm to put itself up for auction. Hedge funds see Maag playing a critical role in a J&J deal, potentially persuading Clozel the offer is too good for shareholders to pass up. ”We are monitoring the situation very actively,” said one hedge fund manager, speaking on condition of anonymity.  ”I would strongly assume pretty much every other   fund in the world is doing the same. I have heard of   funds who already have several $100 million worth of stock.”  (Additional reporting by Paul Arnold; Writing by Ludwig Burger; Editing by Susan Fenton) Biopharmaceutical company Celgene Corp will buy a stake in BeiGene Ltd and help develop and commercialize BeiGene’s investigational treatment for tumor cancers, the companies said on Wednesday.

129295,194064,Demonstrators march in Brazil to support corruption crackdown,Reuters,Paulo Prada,2016-12-04,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-protests-idUSKBN13T0O1?il=0  ," Demonstrators protested across Brazil on Sunday to denounce corruption and a congressional vote perceived as an effort to intimidate judges and prosecutors leading graft probes. Dressed mostly in the national colors of yellow and green, thousands marched to demand accountability at a time when Latin America’s biggest country is reeling from corruption scandals, political gridlock and a prolonged economic recession. In São Paulo, the country’s largest city, about 15, 000 people, according to state police, marched down the business thoroughfare of Avenida Paulista, unfurling a long banner reading ”Corrupt Congress.” At a seaside march in Rio de Janeiro, where two former governors were recently jailed on corruption charges, demonstrators waved banners with messages like ”We are all Sergio Moro,” the judge overseeing a historic investigation into kickbacks around the   oil company. The demonstrations are smaller than massive marches that erupted in recent years when an economic boom soured and   leftist policies exhausted public finances. With the downturn, though, Brazilians are increasingly frustrated by an   culture of unpunished corruption. The problems this year helped topple former President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached for breaking budget rules. They now plague the administration of President Michel Temer, her conservative successor, who many Brazilians already complain inspires little hope for change. In a statement, Temer said the demonstrations showed ”the force and vitality” of Brazil’s democracy. But protesters, many of whom hailed from the   and wealthy classes who took part in marches against Rousseff, argued much still needs to be done. ”The struggle has to continue,” said Iara Soares, a    schoolteacher in Rio, where police declined to estimate a turnout. ”We need a real renovation.” Temer, who took over for Rousseff last May, has already lost four ministers to corruption allegations. Last week, Brazil’s Supreme Court indicted Renan Calheiros, the president of the Senate, over   graft charges. Then there was the uproar over a hasty vote last week by the lower house of Congress to gut an   bill, amending it to enable prosecutors and judges to be punished for alleged abuses of authority. In Brasília, where police calculated roughly 5, 000 protesters, one group carried a giant poster of a rodent bearing the Senate president’s name. ”We let these rats govern us for so long,” said Sonia, a demonstrator who declined to give her surname because she is a civil servant. ”Lawmakers don’t care what the people in the street think.”  (Additional reporting by Anthony Boadle and Marcela Ayres in Brasilia; Editing by Mary Milliken) QAMISHLI,   The head of the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said on Wednesday that Turkish military deployments near   areas of northwestern Syria amounted to a ”declaration of war” which could trigger clashes within days.

129508,194448,Rick Perry a leading candidate for U.S. energy post: source,Reuters,Steve Holland,2016-12-11,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-energy-idUSKBN140108  ," Rick Perry, who proposed eliminating the U. S. Energy Department during his unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, has emerged as a leading candidate to head the agency under   Donald Trump, a transition official said on Sunday. Democratic U. S. Senators Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia also are in the running for the job as Trump continues to fill key positions in his administration ahead of taking office on Jan. 20, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Perry served as governor of Texas, a leading   state, from 2000 when he succeeded President George W. Bush until 2015. In his two unsuccessful presidential runs, he touted his record of job creation in the    state. Perry’s proposal to scrap the Energy Department caused what has become known as his ”oops” moment during a November 2011 debate when he could not remember the departments he wanted to eliminate. ”It’s three agencies of government when I get there that are gone: commerce, education and the um, what’s the third one there? Let’s see,” Perry said. His debate adversaries tried to prod his memory, but Perry ultimately gave up, saying, ”I can’t. The third one, I can’t. Sorry. Oops.” It was the Energy Department, which is responsible for U. S. energy policy and oversees the nation’s nuclear weapons program. Perry also ran for the 2016 presidential nomination against Trump but dropped out in September 2015 after gaining little traction. Perry initially was a fierce critic of Trump but later endorsed Trump and called him ”the people’s choice.” In July 2015, Perry said: ”Let no one be mistaken: Donald Trump’s candidacy is a cancer on conservatism, and it must be clearly diagnosed, excised and discarded.” If Perry gets the job, it would be further indication that the incoming Trump administration may be friendly toward the fossil fuel industry. Trump is set to pick U. S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a   skeptic and an advocate for expanded oil and gas development, to head the Interior Department. Trump’s pick for the Environmental Protection Agency is  Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, an ardent opponent of President Barack Obama’s measures to curb climate change who has sued the EPA to block in a bid to undo a key regulation to curb greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from   power plants. And Trump is expected to name Rex Tillerson, chief executive of oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp, as secretary of state.

129543,194516,Trump taps Goldman Sachs executive Cohn for key economic post,Reuters,Tim Ahmann and Olivia Oran,2016-12-13,2016.0,12.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-cohn-announcement-idUSKBN1412HT  ," U. S.   Donald Trump on Monday said he would appoint Goldman Sachs Group Inc President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn to head the White House National Economic Council, a group that coordinates economic policy across agencies. ”As my top economic adviser, Gary Cohn is going to put his talents as a highly successful businessman to work for the American people,” Trump said in a statement. Cohn will follow former senior Goldman executives Robert Rubin and Stephen Friedman, who ran the council in the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, respectively.  The council post, which helps to coordinate and develop the president’s economic agenda, can also be seen as a stepping stone to other government jobs. Rubin led the council before becoming Treasury Secretary.  Cohn, 56, is just one of a number of former Goldman executives who are slated to join the Trump administration and advise on the economy, including Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin and White House adviser Steve Bannon. ”We will miss Gary at Goldman Sachs, but I believe the American people and the   are fortunate that he has chosen to serve his country,” Goldman Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement.  Cohn had long been regarded as the likely successor to Blankfein, but that view has dimmed in the past several years as Blankfein, 62, showed no signs that he would step down in the near future.  Cohn’s departure now raises fresh questions about who might succeed Blankfein in the long run, while potentially giving rise to a new group of leaders at the bank.  Unlike other Wall Street firms that have had significant turnover in their upper ranks, Goldman’s leadership has remained remarkably stable over the years. Some Goldman executives have privately complained that this has created a bottleneck for the next generation of leaders. It is likely that Cohn’s role as Goldman’s president may be split, Reuters has previously reported. Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz and investment banking   David Solomon are likely candidates, according to people familiar with the matter. Such a move could return Goldman to a     operating officer structure. Cohn had previously served alongside Jon Winkelried in this arrangement, until Winkelried’s departure from the firm in 2009.  Cohn is a former Goldman commodities trader from Ohio who joined the firm in 1990. He served in a variety of leadership roles in bond trading, becoming   of Goldman’s broader securities division and then   in 2006.

130746,196741,My conversations with Russians about Donald Trump,Vox,Ksenia Anske,2017/3/10,2017.0,3.0,http://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/3/10/14872040/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-russia," My first shock is a   TV mounted high on the wall in one of the airport cafes. American policemen are gassing a crowd of protesters. It’s a little after 7 am on January 26, six days since the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States. I have just arrived at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport from New York. The last time I visited Russia, the country of my birth, was in October 2013.    The ticker headline on the TV screen reads Unruly political situation in the US after presidential elections. The camera cuts to a white male officer who grabs a black woman by the arm and forces her to the ground. I can’t move; I stand and stare.  This is how the country that took me in as an immigrant 18 years ago is portrayed on Russian TV  —   as racist, violent, chaotic. The imagery conjures up propaganda from the Cold War days. Americans, we were told, were crazed and aggressive, the product of corrupt democracy and degenerate morals. I pick up my bag and hurry into   degrees Celsius weather. The cold is my second shock. Had I forgotten it so easily? But it’s nothing compared to my third  —   the slow shock that builds through conversations that will invariably turn to American elections: “What’s going on in your America?”     Over the next three weeks of walking freezing streets, riding the metro, and sitting at kitchen tables laden with food and vodka, I listen to Russian disdain for America and the general mistrust of governments, politics, and elections  —   the hot buttons that haven’t changed since I left Russia in 1998.     Everyone has an opinion for me on imminent wars, unpredictable leaders, and the powerlessness of ordinary people to bring about change. Some of it is laced with nostalgia for Soviet times, when to scorn and to slander was admired as strength and to love and to empathize was branded as weakness.  I’m baffled at so much disillusionment, but whenever I open my mouth, I’m rolled over as with a bulldozer. My opinion is dismissed as irrelevant, laughable: After living in America for nearly two decades, I’m too comfortable, in Russians’ eyes, to speak about their pain. Yet when I say I’ll be writing about our conversations, the assertive bravado gives way to fear: Most people I talk to don’t want me to use their names. I’ve used real names only where I have permission, and pseudonyms where indicated.       “They’re puppets. Politicians. All of them. Putin, Trump, Obama. ”  “At least there won’t be a war,” says a sturdy woman in her late 50s, a pensionerka. A pensioner. We’re waiting for the same bus, watching the afternoon traffic crawl along the   avenue. “If Clinton won, there’d be war with Russia. With Trump, it’ll be softer. He’s a businessman. But I think there will be civil war in America. A misfortune. ” She shivers. “Why do you think there will be civil war ?” “Because they’re puppets. ” She waves a dismissive hand. “Politicians. All of them. Putin, Trump, Obama. At least Trump will try to deliver what his bosses want. ” She explains that by “bosses,” she means America’s business tycoons who made their money in gas and oil  —   a belief I hear over and over again in the following days. Her tone is tinged with anger and bitterness over the crumbling economy in Russia. Her idea of the civil war in America  —   whites against blacks, Chinese, Latinos, Muslims  —   is fueled by   racism and the particular flavor of Russian chauvinism that discriminates against any nonwhite ethnic group. When I ask her to elaborate on this, she eyes me suspiciously. “Why do you want to know?”    “I’m interested in your opinion. ” “Who cares about my opinion?” she snaps. “Nothing I’ll say will change it. It’s like it always was. ”    “Our government is just like your government, concerned with only one thing  —   power”  I hear the same defeatism when talking to a single mother in her 30s who lives in a newly erected city block on the outskirts of Moscow.  “It’s all a provocation,” she says. “Your elections. ” We sit in her searing hot kitchen. She’s breastfeeding her baby; I eat a slice of bread and drink kefir. “Similar to how Putin was elected. They told us, here’s your new president. And there stands this little guy in short pants. Like a little boy! Who appointed him? Why? We’ll never know. Same in America. Who appointed Trump?” “American voters,” I say. She tosses back her head and laughs. The baby spits out the nipple, startled. “It’s like an ass and a finger. We’ll never know who fucks whom. American thinkers will now have more sympathy for Russia. It’s a good thing. It’ll be better for everybody if Russia were more stable. This constant confrontation between our countries is like bad romance. He charmed her; she betrayed him. I’m tired of hearing it. ” Her words resonate with me. During the 2016 election, for the first time in my 18 years in America, I saw the same regressive thinking I’d witnessed at the fall of the Soviet Union in my teens: The loss of the power status and the economic hurt led Americans to choose the white, straight, patriarchal, Christian fantasy that no longer exists, just like it drove Russians into the streets chanting, “Bring back Stalin!”  “So you’re happy Trump got elected, and not Clinton?” I ask.    She nods. “Absolutely. I don’t like Clinton’s personality. She was slandering Russia for everything. Russia did this, Russia did that. Like we’re the bad guy. And we’re not, you know? We’re just people, like Americans. Our government is just like your government, concerned with only one thing  —   power. ” I feel saddened. This kind of Russian fatalism is precisely what made me immigrate. I was tired of listening to predictions of doom, tired of witnessing people spend their time arguing over why they’d fail instead of doing something and actually failing. “It’s a big win for Russia, for Putin’s propaganda” I have lunch in a restaurant with a   and    businessman in his 50s. “Most Russians believe the media,” he says. “They believe Trump is great because he’s portrayed as great. ” I think back to my recent visit to a bookstore. The   books were piled up on the table at the entrance, at least three of them with Trump on the cover, the title promising to teach you how to gain incredible power and wealth. “It’s a big win for Russia, for Putin’s propaganda,” the businessman continues. “Russians love Putin because he has made Russia stand up for itself. They are willing to suffer terrible living conditions for their restored national pride. They don’t know the price they’re paying for it. It simply doesn’t enter their heads. ” “And what’s your position?” He smiles, spreads his arms. “I have no position. Position is relative. It all depends on people’s mentality. Russians think differently from Americans. We’re a big country with a small   used to being pushed around. After Putin came to power, the rest of the world suddenly started considering us. It’s fertile ground for Putin. You watch, he’ll get elected again and again. Until it finally hurts enough for people to wake up. ”    “And when will that be?” “When people start thinking for themselves. It’s easy to fool the stupid,” he says unkindly. “Let me pour you more tea. ” Tea is the social glue in Russia. Every awkward moment can be smoothed over with an offer of more tea or food.  “Trump is fresh blood. He doesn’t need a salary. He’s a businessman! Doesn’t care what anyone thinks. ” “Eat,” says Olga, 41, my cousin. She pushes a plate of cabbage pie in my direction. It’s night; thick snowflakes drift behind the window. Around the kitchen table sit her husband and two friends.  “How is your Trump over there? He’s got it all in gold in his tower. ‘Gold like in the mouth of gypsies! ’” The table roars with laughter.  I’m stunned. I haven’t heard this expression before, but I see how the jealousy over Trump’s wealth and the typical hostility toward the Romani people has been neatly rolled into one sentence, to be used as a gag.  “You know the running joke? About your presidents?” Olga asks me. “Last year was the year of the ape, and this year it’s the year of the rooster!” They roar again. I stare blankly.  “Ape,” she says. “Your Obama. He’s an ape. And Trump is a rooster!”    The blood drains from my face. They laugh again, this time at my reaction, at my becoming so   in America about racism that I can’t even laugh with them.  I’m struck speechless. I’d readied myself for this ahead of time, rehearsing phrases like, “Do you realize that this joke is wrong because it perpetuates the dehumanization of a person based on their skin color?” and, “Do you see how you use humor to put yourself above a whole group of people  —   human beings just like you?” But I’d forgotten what it’s like to experience it firsthand  —   just like that shocking cold.    “Trump is fresh blood,” Olga says. “He doesn’t need salary. He’s a businessman! Doesn’t care what anyone thinks. ”  “So. You jumped around in that pink hat,” Olga says later in the conversation, referring to my participation in the Women’s March. “What for?” “For women’s rights. ” “What rights are you deprived of?” she sneers. I’m surprised at her reaction, but only for a moment. This habit of sarcastic dismissal of an individual’s opposition to power  —   it’s unequal, therefore it’s doomed  —   is part of the oppressive regime survival tactic I myself adopted in childhood and was able to start shedding in America only a few years ago. It took years to recognize it and to heal. Russians laugh at hardships to keep from crying. I knew that her reducing my protest to a silly thing was the admission of her carefully hidden pain over the inability to do the same in Russia.   “I believe the democratic core in America is strong and Trump will be overthrown”  My next meeting is in a kitchen again. It’s me and four women spanning three generations  —   “Lena,” 41; her two teenage daughters, “Tanya” and “Varvara”; and her mother, “Oksana Vladimirovna,” 69  —   all pseudonyms. On our way to her     block, Lena has warned me, “My mom hates Trump. Better don’t ask her  —   she’ll talk your ears off. The whole time the election was happening, she was sitting on Facebook, reading posts. When I asked her why she hates him, she couldn’t explain it to me. ”     “I can explain it to you,” Oksana Vladimirovna says when I ask her.  “Back in Soviet times, I worked at the voting booths. Not everyone voted, and there were a lot of blank bulletins left over. You know what they did? They marked them with Brezhnev’s name and tossed them in! I said, ‘What are you doing?’ Know what they told me? ‘Someone might be at the dacha. They would’ve voted for Brezhnev anyway.’ Can you believe that?”  She pauses to catch her breath, upset at the memory of blatant lies  —   the vehicle of the political corruption in the USSR. She’s read about Trump’s claims that the 2016 election was “rigged,” and she’s angry  —   angry it’s impossible to know the truth unless you witness it, like she did at the voting booths. “Russians like to blame America for everything bad in Russia,” she concludes. “And it’s understandable. Why is America sticking its nose everywhere? World aggressor! And now Russia will be the world aggressor. They want to be the big bully like America. When will it end?” After dinner, Lena pulls me aside. “Don’t get too worked up over Mama’s words. I believe the democratic core in America is strong and Trump will be overthrown. It’s something we don’t have here, but you have over there. ” In all my conversations, Lena’s was the only positive comment about democracy. The rest dismissed the very idea as tried and failed, with no possibility of honest elections and no chance of the ordinary citizen’s voice being heard; hence, no interest in protests.    “Elections are driven by people with big money, big businesses. Same in Russia. ”  “Elections are driven by people with big money, big businesses,” says my Uber driver, who looks like he’s in his 30s. He moved to Moscow from Ossetia eight years ago. “Same in Russia. ” “Is that what they say on TV?” I ask. He shakes his head. “I don’t watch TV, don’t trust it. Not the news, not the books. Nobody knows what’s truth and what’s lies. I trust only one thing. ” He glances at me. “My eyes. I can see a dead body, if someone is shot. And I can see factories. That’s what Stalin left, factories. People knew how to work back then. If they didn’t, they got shot. If he were alive, he’d just shoot all politicians. That’s what I’d do, shoot them all. ” “You’re serious?” I ask. “Damn right I am!” He smacks the steering wheel. “Look at Putin. He established the National Guard for his own personal protection. A smart move. In China, if a bureaucrat steals, he gets shot, no questions asked. That’s what we need. ” “To shoot people. ” “That’s right. It’s all gone to shit in Russia. I don’t like it, but it’s better than in Ossetia. I got work here. I drive and sell ice cream. It’s a good trade, selling ice cream, better than in America  —   it’s all about selling drugs or guns over there. And now you’re freaking out about Trump. What’s there to freak out about? We Russians have been through it a hundred times.   still sells. McDonald’s is in business like before. ” He chuckles. This pessimism, this apathy, coupled with the authoritarian mindset that death fixes all problems, made me feel sick. After living in America for 18 years, I’d almost forgotten growing up with this; I’d started to believe there is another way. It wasn’t until I landed in New York that the profound difference between the Russian and American outlooks on life hit me. Everyone at the JFK Airport security checkpoint was smiling. In the past, I discounted it with my leftover Russian cynicism as fake American politeness. This time, I couldn’t. I’ve changed enough to feel it in my gut. Every face  —   black, brown, white  —   shone with life.     I sat on a bench and cried.  “This is what systemic oppression does to people,” I thought. “It kills hope. This is what I ran away from, and what’s caught up with me in America. And I’m done running. I’ll stay and fight. ” Ksenia Anske was born in Moscow and came to the US in 1998 not knowing English, having studied architecture, and not dreaming that one day she’d be writing.

130912,197102,Rep. Devin Nunes sure seems like the wrong person to lead the Trump-Russia probe,Vox,Yochi Dreazen,2017/3/27,2017.0,3.0,http://www.vox.com/2017/3/27/15073638/devin-nunes-trump-wiretapping-claim-obama," Someone needs to tell House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes to stop digging.    Nunes has faced sustained criticism for a bombshell announcement last Wednesday that an unnamed source had given him information that seemed to validate Donald Trump’s baseless wiretapping allegations. Nunes later acknowledged he had no such evidence and apologized for personally briefing top White House officials about the supposed information before speaking to the rest of his committee. On Monday, the saga got even stranger  —   and the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate bluntly said that Nunes couldn’t be trusted to lead the congressional investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for Nunes to be removed from his post, while House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, joined by Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Nunes should fully recuse himself from the probe. ”The chair of the House Intelligence [Commitee] has a serious responsibility to the Congress and to the country,” Pelosi said in a statement to CNN Monday evening. ”Chairman Nunes’s discredited behavior has tarnished that office. [House] Speaker [Paul] Ryan must insist that Chairman Nunes at least recuse himself from the   investigation immediately. That leadership is long overdue.”    As of late Monday night, a spokeswoman for Ryan said the embattled House speaker was still standing by Nunes, a   Republican congressman who was a member of the Trump transition team, and would not ask that he recuse himself. But as every new twist of the Trump wiretapping scandal has shown, that type of assurance can quickly change.     Things had begun to go off the rails for Nunes Monday morning after a strange statement from his spokesperson, Jack Langer. In the release, Langer acknowledged that Nunes paid an unannounced visit to the White House complex one day before personally telling Tump  —   and then the American public  —   that there were indications US spies had picked up communications involving Trump transition aides: Chairman Nunes met with his source at the White House grounds in order to have proximity to a secure location where he could view the information provided by the source. The Chairman is extremely concerned by the possible improper unmasking of names of U. S. citizens, and he began looking into this issue even before President Trump tweeted his assertion that the White House had been wiretapped.    There were three   things that in that quote. First, Trump’s wiretapping charge was about Trump Tower, not the White House (a point Langer later corrected). Second, Nunes has access to a highly secure facility on Capitol Hill, so there would be no reason for him to head to the White House to safely view the source’s purported evidence. Finally, the wording raises an obvious question: Did Nunes go to the White House because the source was a member of the Trump administration?  Nunes added to the confusion during an interview with CNN later on Monday when he took pains to say he’d visited the White House grounds, but not the White House itself, and that he didn’t believe Trump or top West Wing staffers even knew he was there. That seemed highly unlikely, since Nunes would have needed to be cleared into the complex  —   meaning that at least one senior White House staffer knew he was coming.   Democrats in both the House and Senate spent the day arguing that Nunes had shown himself to be incapable of leading an impartial investigation. Democrat Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut told CNN that Nunes’s actions were “bizarre” and “loopy,” while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer urged House Speaker Paul Ryan to remove Nunes from his post on the intelligence panel.      ”Chairman Nunes is falling down on the job and seems to be more interested in protecting the president than in seeking the truth,” Schumer said. “You cannot have the person in charge of an impartial investigation be partial to one side. It’s an inherent contradiction. ” The sharpest dagger came from Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence panel. A normally   lawmaker, Schiff had worked hard in recent days to maintain a veneer of bipartisanship when it came to Nunes and the Trump wiretapping probe. That fell away Monday night, revealing a stark political divide about the future of the probe  —   and about Nunes’s integrity and credibility. ”We’ve reached the point, after the events of this week, where it would be very difficult to maintain the credibility of the investigation if the chairman did not recuse himself from matters involving either the Trump campaign or the Trump transition team of which he was a member,” Schiff told CNN. One thing is clear: Nunes has spent more than a week trying to deflect attention from the FBI’s bombshell announcement that it is formally investigating the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, but he’s actually been making Trump’s Russia problem even worse.  That’s bad news for Trump, but it’s even worse news for an ambitious lawmaker getting his first time on the national stage  —   and making so many missteps that he’s now facing criticism from fellow Republicans, calls that he be replaced as head of the intelligence committee, and growing pressure for an independent probe that would bypass his committee entirely.  The head of the   probe is mouthing nonsense To understand what’s been going on, rewind the clock to last Monday, when FBI Director James Comey confirmed for the first time that the bureau was conducting a criminal investigation into “any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government” and into “whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts. ”    Comey  —   joined by Adm. Mike Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency  —   also shot down Trump’s allegation that   Barack Obama tapped his communications during the campaign. Both men flatly said there was no evidence to support Trump’s claim, which had also been refuted by top lawmakers from both parties.  Enter Nunes, whose committee is meant to be overseeing the congressional investigation into Team Trump’s possible Russian ties. On Wednesday, he told reporters that an unnamed source had informed him that US spies had surveilled the Trump administration’s transition team. He also acknowledged going to the White House to brief top officials there before talking to Democratic members of the committee.  Nunes provided no evidence to bolster Trump’s initial accusations, and over the course of the week he started to hedge and walk back the claim that he’d information that supported any part of the president’s allegations. By Friday morning he was saying that he couldn’t be sure that Trump’s or his aides’ conversations were captured by surveillance at all. Nunes also apologized to fellow members of the House Intelligence Committee for going to the White House in the first place. But that wasn’t the end of Nunes’s Russia stumbles. On Friday, he infuriated Democrats anew by abruptly canceling a planned public hearing with top former national security officials about Russian interference in the 2016 election. The House panel was originally scheduled to hear from President Obama’s former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan, and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Tuesday.  The cancellation sparked a strong response from Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, who took to Twitter to slam the move as an “attempt to choke off public info. ” On Monday, Schiff, said Nunes should recuse himself from any further role in the investigation. Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain cited Nunes’s actions when he renewed his calls for a specially appointed and nonpartisan select committee to take over the   investigation from Congress: ”No longer does the Congress have credibility to handle this alone, and I don’t say that lightly,” he said.    Some mainstream conservative media figures, like Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough, had an even stronger reaction than McCain. “If the Republican Party wants to do what is best for this country and its national security, they will remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman,” Scarborough tweeted. In a blistering editorial, meanwhile, the New York Times said Nunes had “destroyed the credibility of his committee” and “[made] clear that he is unfit for the job and should be replaced. ” As my colleague Zack Beauchamp noted, sacrificing his credibility with Democrats and the Republican mainstream on the comparatively minor issue of Trump Tower surveillance means that Nunes has managed to create pressure to take the much more important investigation into Trump’s Russia ties out of his hands.  That’s bad news for Trump. In the short term, though, it’s even worse news for Nunes. "
130974,197203,"27 of April 2017’s best streaming debuts on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, HBO, and more",Vox,Vox Culture,2017/3/31,2017.0,3.0,http://www.vox.com/culture/2017/3/31/15099064/april-2017-streaming-netflix-hulu-amazon-hbo," We’ll level with you: April 2017 is absolutely stacked with new streaming options, to the point where the committed viewer could get away with not leaving the house for the entire month. There’s a true bounty, featuring hotly anticipated original TV series, intriguing new documentaries, underseen recent classics, and some of the best films of last year.    We don’t recommend going quite so far as to forgo the outside world in favor of devouring the streaming riches on offer, but we’re attempting to make it a little easier to plan just how much of April you’ll need to devote to watching All of the Things. We’ve pulled the best options from a variety of services  —   Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, HBO, Showtime, and Starz  —   and arranged them by premiere date. There’s something promising debuting every few days, so bust out the calendar, cancel your social engagements, and start planning how you’re going to get through it all. Premiering April 1  The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (HBO  )  Andrew Dominik’s 2007 release was barely shown in theaters, due to the indifference of its distributor, Warner Bros. But its tale of the life and death of Jesse James  —   as seen through the eyes of his assassin  —   is one of the best movies released since 2000, with grandly poetic images and beautiful performances from Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck.  Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters   Attack (Starz)  Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters   Attack (GMK) is what   reboots Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island are building to: a gigantic   complete with laser beams, massive furry moths, and   dragons fighting one another. Granted, special effects have gotten a lot better since GMK came out in 2001, but there’s enough silly monster stuff here to keep you entertained and looking forward to 2019’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters.     The Kids Are All Right (Starz)   Midlife crises are collective in Lisa Cholodenko’s   comedy about a modern family thrown into upheaval by the arrival of the sperm donor to two lesbian parents (Annette Bening and Julianne Moore). Awkward as only a liberal dramedy can be, The Kids Are All Right features spotless performances by a veteran ensemble, including a breakout turn from Mia Wasikowska as the curious daughter determined to form a fledgling relationship with her biological dad. What’s great about The Kids Are All Right is that everyone is a mess, and that’s all right too. Plus, Mark Ruffalo gets to play the hot rebel  —   a rare treat.     Teen Witch (Starz)  1989’s Teen Witch is about the most important things in life: high school, magic, mean teachers, true love, and some really   dude named Brad. There’s also a makeover and Zelda Rubinstein, known for her work as the creepy medium Tangina in the Poltergeist franchise, as a slightly less creepy but still strange Madame Serena. Teen Witch is not to be confused with 2016’s The Witch, a horror story about a teenager who eventually becomes a witch  —   but who, unlike Teen Witch’s protagonist, does not have the ability to magically imbue others with rapping abilities.  Premiering April 4  Chewing Gum season 2 (Netflix)  One of Netflix’s recent British imports is the very funny    comedy Chewing Gum.    Michaela Coel is fantastic as the equally gawky and curious Tracey, who in the first season launched herself into the brand new world of sex with such reckless abandon that the results were both hilarious and horrifying. Season two promises more of the same.     Dimension 404 season 1 (Hulu)  Hulu’s answer to Black Mirror is this anthology series about the darkest corners of the internet, produced by the   online video kings at Rocket Jump. The series boasts an amazing cast  —   including everybody from Patton Oswalt to Lea Michele  —   and its vibe looks a little more overtly   than Black Mirror’s dystopian hues. Premiering April 5  Preacher season 1 (Hulu)  This 2016 adaptation of the acclaimed comic book of the same name lacks the kind of overarching storyline that would make it really compelling, but as a delivery mechanism for exciting moments, it’s a lot of fun. Like most   shows, it should play very well in a binge. Hang in there for some of the truly inventive fight scenes, and for the performances of Ruth Negga as the   Tulip and Dominic Cooper as the chaplain with strange powers who gives the series its title. Premiering April 6  The BFG (Netflix)  The most recent film by Steven Spielberg  —   released just last summer!  —   rather crashed and burned at the box office, despite its   premise and children’s literature pedigree. The gentle, lovely little film follows a young girl who meets the Big Friendly Giant of the title, and it’s sprinkled with just enough of the dark horrors of the Roald Dahl novel it’s based on to make it engaging.    Premiering April 7  The Get Down season 1, part 2 (Netflix)  The Get Down’s bizarre release strategy  —   the first season was released in two halves eight months apart  —   and a messy pilot seem to have gotten in the way of buzz for this energetic, enthralling tribute to the Bronx in the ’70s, the early days of   and the creative impulse. Here’s hoping the season’s final five episodes wrap up the storylines in satisfying fashion, because the series may be too expensive for Netflix to renew.  American Playboy (Amazon)  Does the world really need a   “docuseries” about the life of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner? Probably not, but Amazon is giving this one a big push anyway, and its promise of rarely seen footage from Hefner’s archive, alongside scripted scenes starring actors as the young Hef and pals, could make for something intriguing. Premiering April 8  Kubo and the Two Strings (Netflix)   With its gorgeous   design, a tale of adventure and fantasy in Japan, and the borrowed spirit of legendary filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, Kubo and the Two Strings was one of our favorite movies of 2016. Ostensibly about a boy searching for his lost family, Kubo knows what all good stories know  —   that a story reveals as much about the teller as the tale. Laika’s   animation turns every story into a feat, made even more epic by the herculean studio efforts that went into the film’s creation. Kubo features the largest   puppet ever created, and took five years of painstaking labor to finish. The result is pure cinema magic. Premiering April 13  Short Term 12 (Hulu)   Before she was tapped to play Captain Marvel, Brie Larson played a superhero of a more humble sort in Destin Daniel Cretton’s Short Term 12. The film follows the action at a residential group facility for troubled teens, where Larson’s Grace is a senior member of the support staff. Her difficult job takes a toll on her, though  —   particularly affecting her relationship with her boyfriend, who also works at the facility  —   which comes to a head with the introduction of a new resident who stirs up some buried trauma.   The Handmaiden (Amazon)  It’s just about impossible to describe Park  ’s stunning film without ruining the twists, but we’ll give it a shot. Though it was adapted from Sarah Waters’s book The Fingersmith, which takes place in Victorian England, The Handmaiden is set in 1930s   Korea, as an ambitious Korean handmaiden (Kim  ) plots against her charismatic Japanese mistress (Kim  ). But if that sounds straightforward, trust us: it’s not. The Handmaiden is a twisty, sexy thriller that never goes in the direction it’s telling you it is, which makes for one hell of a fun ride.  Premiering April 14  The Love Witch (Amazon)  The Love Witch is lit and shot to look like a 1960s Technicolor film, with costumes and sets designed by   Anna Biller to evoke a vaguely psychedelic fairy     horror   feminist psychosexual dramedy about a woman who’s hunting for a man (literally). If that bizarre combination appeals to you, you’re in luck  —   while The Love Witch leans heavily on its inspirations, it isn’t like anything you’ve seen before. It’s deliciously campy, sometimes shocking, and totally unconventional.     The Babadook (Hulu)   One of the best of a recent wave of outstanding horror films, The Babadook effectively made single motherhood into the ultimate nightmare while propelling its cast and crew into the   limelight. The Babadook delivers a star turn for Essie Davis as Amelia, the mother whose attempts to deal with her hyperactive, perpetually terrified son (Noah Wiseman) leave her exhausted, isolated, and open to the curse of the dreaded Babadook, a ghoulish children’s book monster. (Think Slender Man, but  .) This is already prime horror material, but   Jennifer Kent levels up by turning Amelia’s psychological breakdown into something so raw and scary that it becomes a form of primal feminist rage. If you think you’ve seen this one before, watch it again; it rewards repeat viewings like few films of its ilk.  Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return (Netflix)  Twelve seasons, one epic crowdfunding campaign, one successful offshoot cult website, and an infinite number of     later, Joel and the Bots are back! Longed for by fans of terrible   the world over, MST3K returns for an entire new season with an ensemble of geeky   including Jonah Ray as the host, and Felicia Day and Patton Oswalt as descendants of the original mad scientists who started this whole shebang. Keep an eye on the cult bad flick Reptilicus, which appears to be one of the movies riffed on, and enjoy the kitschy retro look of the comeback. Oh, and look out for MOVIE SIGN! Premiering April 16  Guerrilla (Showtime)  April is a crowded month for new TV, and Showtime’s big entry is this new   miniseries from 12 Years a Slave screenwriter and American Crime creator John Ridley. It follows 1970s political activists as they work to break cycles of police violence in the United Kingdom, and it stars Freida Pinto and Idris Elba, among others. The intersection of social justice and history is a place within which Ridley usually works well, so this is one to anticipate. Premiering April 21  Bill Nye Saves the World, season 1 (Netflix)  A science talk show isn’t the most natural idea in the world, but if there’s anybody who can make it work, it’s the inexhaustible Bill Nye. The first season of his new Netflix series unleashes a torrent of celebrity guests upon a variety of important science topics (climate change! GMOs! sex!) complete with   demonstrations.  Premiering April 22  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (HBO)   In 2010, a nonfiction book about the true story behind the world’s most commonly replicated “immortal” strain of lab cells became an unlikely    —   and HBO’s teaser trailer for its new adaptation of the book gives you a taste of how surprising and dramatic that story is. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a strange, harrowing, and deeply moving story of the way corporate greed often consumes and usurps individual identity, even after death. Throw in legendary Broadway director George C. Wolfe working with Oprah Winfrey and Hamilton’s Renée Elise Goldsberry, and this adaptation is a  . (You should probably have tissues ready.) Premiering April 25  Queen of Katwe (Netflix)  Mira Nair’s Queen of Katwe is based on the true story of Phiona Mutesi, an illiterate teenager from a slum outside the Ugandan capital of Kampala who discovers she has a knack for chess, thanks to a missionary (who also grew up in the slums) running a chess club for local kids. Starring Lupita Nyong’o, David Oyelowo, and newcomer Madina Nalwanga, it’s heartwarming and inspirational, but also the opposite of a white savior movie  —   and all the better for it. This is one for the whole family.    Premiering April 26  The Handmaid’s Tale (Hulu)  Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel  —   about an America overtaken by a   movement that systemically deprives women of their rights  —   is 30 years old, but it has never felt more timely. Hulu’s highly anticipated new TV version is a smart, compelling adaptation that uses Atwood’s novel as a window into a terrifyingly plausible world. Mad Men’s Elisabeth Moss anchors the uniformly excellent cast (including Alexis Bledel, showing sides she never did on Gilmore Girls) but the real star here is the textured, detailed world building and the newfound urgency and immediacy of the story’s dystopian impulse. Premiering April 27  American Honey (Amazon)  British director Andrea Arnold takes a visually stunning, nearly   ramble through   America in this    road movie.   actor Sasha Lane plays Star, a   but naive teenager who falls in with a crowd of rowdy youths; the group  —   overseen by a   Shia LaBeouf  —   traverses the country in a van, selling magazine subscriptions to unsuspecting marks. A rambunctious movie with a lot on its mind, American Honey is a complicated evocation of the freedom that comes with having nothing, and what it means to define yourself outside of possessions. Premiering April 28  Casting JonBenet (Netflix)  In Casting JonBenet, a group of actors in Colorado audition to play characters in a movie about JonBenet Ramsey, the    beauty queen who was murdered in her family’s home the day after Christmas in 1996. Through the audition process, the actors start to reveal what they think about the case and how their own personal experiences shape what they believe. In the process, what we believe about the   case gets more complicated too. Casting JonBenet is a quiet and moving look at how we think about crime in America, and how not just media coverage but also our own lives mess with our sense of objectivity.  Dear White People season 1 (Netflix)  Director Justin Simien adapts his 2014 satirical film into a   TV season, a key part of Netflix’s attempts in 2017 to diversify its original series. The movie was pretty terrific (and funny) as it stood, but it’s not as if the intervening years haven’t given Simien more topics to tackle and issues to raise. And if early episodes are any indication, he’s done so with aplomb.  Catastrophe (Amazon)  The British comedy Catastrophe is a raunchy, delightfully unvarnished look at the challenges of marriage and parenthood, minus most of the clichéd trappings that usually accompany those topics. The painfully funny, eminently filthy series will tread some serious ground in season three, as central couple Sharon and Rob try to keep it together and manage their family of four in the aftermath of a drunken and devastating season two cliffhanger. While that may sound grim, it’s exactly the type of scenario that series creators and stars Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney excel at mining for comedy. The   season also features Carrie Fisher in the last role she filmed before her death on December 27, 2016; Fisher plays Rob’s overwhelmingly critical mother, Mia, and according to Delaney, she’s “a huge part” of the season three finale.  Premiering April 30  American Gods season 1, episode 1 (Starz)  In certain corners of the internet, this Starz adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s novel of the same name is the most anticipated TV series of the year, thanks to both a stunning cast (including old favorites such as Ian McShane and vibrant newcomers like Ricky Whittle) and showrunners like Bryan Fuller and Michael Green. Fuller, in particular, brought the seemingly unadaptable Hannibal Lecter books to TV, and the early episodes of American Gods suggest he might have done the same for this tale of old gods washing up on American shores.  Animal Kingdom season 1 (Amazon)  There’s no reason this TNT adaptation of the 2010 Australian crime drama film should be as good as it is. And indeed, the early episodes take some time to put all the pieces into place. But former Halt and Catch Fire showrunner Jonathan Lisco and his team finally turn the story of a crime boss mother and her fractious sons into a simmering family drama, filled with rage, regret, and secrets. If you liked Netflix’s Bloodline but wished it were 15 percent creepier, this is the show for you. "
131035,197304,How Tesla surpassed GM and Ford to become America’s most valuable car company,Vox,Timothy B. Lee,2017/4/4,2017.0,4.0,http://www.vox.com/new-money/2017/4/4/15176904/tesla-ford-stock-price," After surpassing Ford in value last week, Tesla became the most valuable car company in America Monday as it surged past General Motors. As I write this, Tesla is worth $51 billion, compared with $50 billion for GM and $45 billion for Ford.    At first glance, that doesn’t make any sense. Ford sold 6. 6 million vehicles in 2016 and earned $4. 6 billion for the year. GM sold 10 million cars in 2016 and earned $9. 4 billion. Tesla shipped a comparatively tiny 76, 000 vehicles and recorded a loss of $675 million.  The fact that Tesla’s stock is worth more than Ford’s and about as much as GM’s is a sign that Wall Street envisions very different trajectories for the two companies. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has set aggressive growth goals for his company, aiming to produce 500, 000 vehicles in 2018 and close to 1 million vehicles by 2020. But even if Musk meets these targets  —   and that’s a big if  —   that still wouldn’t justify valuing Tesla more highly than Ford or GM, which already sell millions of vehicles every year. So the relatively low market prices of Ford and GM seems to also be a signal that investors are pessimistic about these Detroit auto companies’ prospects. Many observers expect that over the next decade or two, the car industry will shift from     cars to   electric vehicles. Car companies believe they’ll be able to navigate this transition gracefully, but Wall Street doesn’t seem to believe it.    Wall Street sees Tesla, not classic companies like Ford and GM, as the future of cars.    Tesla is aiming to be the Apple of the car business             To understand what the market might be thinking, it’s worth remembering what happened in the cellphone industry a decade ago. Back in 2007, the cellphone market was dominated by Nokia with 435 million units, followed by Motorola with 164 million units. Apple released the first iPhone that year, but it sold fewer than 4 million units. So it would have been easy for a naive analyst at the time to dismiss Apple as a minor player. What that analyst would have missed, of course, was that the nature of cellphones was about to change. The kind of   “feature phones” that accounted for the bulk of Nokia’s sales was about to be rendered obsolete by the iPhone and a new wave of   smartphones.    Nokia executives weren’t too worried. They didn’t have the iPhone, but they had plenty of engineers and strong relationships with mobile network operators around the world. They assumed they’d be able to build a rival smartphone operating system and be a major player in the smartphone business. But making an   smartphone proved to be harder than they expected, and Nokia was caught  . Efforts to create its own software floundered, and a partnership with Microsoft to use Windows Phone software failed to gain traction. The company was forced to sell its mobile phone division to Microsoft in 2014  —   a humiliating end for a company that once led the cellphone industry. We don’t know if something like this is in the cards for Ford and GM, but it would be one way to explain why Tesla is so highly valued in comparison. Executives in Detroit think they can easily pivot to making electric,   cars, just as Nokia thought it could adapt to a smartphone world.     Apple sells 20 percent of smartphones and earns most of the profits            One other important lesson from the smartphone world is that profits in a   industry are sometimes much more skewed than market share. Apple sells fewer than 20 percent of the world’s smartphones. But the fact that the company makes both the hardware and software for the iPhone helps it stand apart in the marketplace, allowing it to charge a much bigger premium than its   rivals. The result: Despite the iPhone’s modest market share, Apple’s quarterly profits often dwarf the profits of all other smartphone makers combined. Like Apple, Tesla makes many components of its cars, from batteries to   software, in house. Its roots in Silicon Valley mean that the software on its cars is likely to be better than software produced by companies like Ford or GM  —   a factor that will become even more important as   technology becomes a significant factor in the industry. Like Apple, Tesla has a significant base of ardent fans who follow its every move and are eager to buy its new products. Tesla’s big bet on batteries could pay off handsomely Tesla is also aiming to duplicate another of Apple’s key strategies: making big investments to lock in its supply of key components. One of Tesla’s big bets is on batteries. Electric cars need a lot of lithium ion batteries, and over the years Tesla has struggled to find suppliers to meet its needs. So a few years ago Tesla broke ground on the Gigafactory, a facility in Nevada that will supply the company with batteries on a massive scale. Musk is betting that the Gigafactory will give him a big head start over rivals. He’s hoping economies of scale will make Tesla’s batteries cheaper than those from third parties. And as other car companies rush to build electric cars, they’ll discover there aren’t enough batteries to go around, making it hard for car companies to expand electric car production as quickly as Tesla can. Obviously, it’s too early to say if this theory is right.

131401,198042,Henry Kissinger just damned Jared Kushner with the faintest of praise,Vox,Zack Beauchamp,2017/4/20,2017.0,4.0,http://www.vox.com/world/2017/4/20/15373668/henry-kissinger-jared-kushner-time-100," On Thursday, Time magazine published its list of the 100 most influential people on earth. One of them is President Trump’s    and top adviser Jared Kushner  —   an obvious choice on Time’s part given that Kushner has been assigned responsibility for handling everything from the opioid crisis to the   conflict.    Time got Henry Kissinger, President Nixon’s ethically dubious foreign policy consigliere, to write a short blurb about Kushner  —   and his praise was comically faint. Here’s the whole    —   I’ve omitted nothing:  Transitioning the presidency between parties is one of the most complex undertakings in American politics. The change triggers an upheaval in the intangible mechanisms by which Washington runs: an incoming President is likely to be less familiar with formal structures, and the greater that gap, the heavier the responsibility of those advisers who are asked to fill it. This space has been traversed for nearly four months by Jared Kushner, whom I first met about 18 months ago, when he introduced himself after a foreign policy lecture I had given. We have sporadically  exchanged views since. As part of the Trump family, Jared is familiar with the intangibles of the President. As a graduate of Harvard and NYU, he has a broad education; as a businessman, a knowledge of administration. All this should help him make a success of his daunting role flying close to the sun.  Five things to note about this:     The entire thing is the most lukewarm of lukewarm praise, about as generic and uninspired as it comes. One academic I follow on Twitter called it “the letter of recommendation you never want an advisor to send,” which sounds about right. It may have been legitimately hard for Kissinger to say much more about someone who has no formal qualifications in foreign policy or experience in government and is now occupying arguably the most important policy role in the White House. Kissinger can’t be more specific because Kushner doesn’t really have any specific accomplishments in government to point to, other than marrying astutely. In private life, contra Kissinger, Kushner doesn’t have a lot of successes. His tenure as head of the New York Observer was disastrous, his family real estate company’s flagship skyscraper has low occupancy rates and a serious debt problem, and it’s been credibly reported that his dad bought his place at Harvard with a $2. 5 million donation. It’s doubly biting because Kissinger is famous in Washington for his ability to flatter people in power in order to gain influence over public policy. If this is the best that America’s foremost master of diplomatic compliments can do  —   well, that’s pretty embarrassing for Kushner. That last bit, about “flying close to the sun,” is particularly delicious. It’s a reference to the Greek fable of Icarus  —   son of the famous inventor Daedalus, who built a pair of wings held together with wax. Icarus used his father’s invention to fly too close to the sun, which melted the wax and caused poor Icarus to plummet to his death. It’s a morality tale about hubris, the arrogant belief in your own ability to accomplish more than you can. Kissinger’s phrasing heavily implies that, in this case, Kushner is Icarus.  "
132249,199390,Why North Korea loves to threaten nuclear war (but will never actually do it),Vox,Max Fisher,2016/3/4,2016.0,3.0,http://www.vox.com/2016/3/4/11160314/north-korea-nuclear-threat," A few hours after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced he had ordered his country’s military on standby for nuclear strikes, the threats came up at Thursday’s Republican presidential debate, and the candidates repeated one of the most common misconceptions about the hermit kingdom.    ”You indeed do have a lunatic in North Korea,” Sen. Marco Rubio said. Sen. Ted Cruz also called Kim a ”lunatic,” as did debate moderator Chris Wallace. The image you get of Kim Jong Un is of an unpredictable wild man, an out of control crazy person, careening around northeast Asia with nuclear weapons. And I don’t mean to pick on Rubio or Cruz; this is a widespread and bipartisan view. But, in fact, while Kim is indeed a dangerous dictator who poses a real threat and oversees some of the world’s worst human rights abuses, and seems to be personally quite eccentric, there is every reason to believe that, far from an erratic ”lunatic,” he is crude and brutal but quite rational dictator. And his behavior, especially including threats like Thursday’s, starts to make a lot more sense when you understand how his regime really works.    There are, broadly speaking, three main reasons for North Korea’s perennial    —   and why he never seems to actually follow through. In any given provocation, the motivation is usually some combination of these three; the degree to which one or another is more important varies, but ultimately these three make the country’s behavior what it is.    1) It’s about maintaining the big lie that keeps North Korea running    An awful lot of North Korea’s behavior can be traced back to a problem it faced in the early 1990s, and how   Kim Jong Il solved it. The problem was this: For decades, the small and isolated country had been propped up by the Soviet Union as a bulwark against Western, capitalist influence in northeast Asia. When the Soviet Union collapsed, the subsidies went away, and North Korea sank into an economic catastrophe so terrible that as much as   of the population starved to death.    During this 1990s crisis, it looked to much of the world like North Korea was about to collapse, and not just because the society itself was crumbling. Its official state ideology had told North Koreans they lived in the freest and most prosperous society on Earth, and it placed North Koreans under a   information cordon to make this lie seem more believable. The famine undermined that lie in two ways. First, no amount of propaganda could convince North Koreans, who were living off tree bark and grass, that their society was prosperous. And second, North Korea had no choice but to ease its border with China, allowing food to enter through the black market, even though this meant a number of North Koreans would glimpse the outside world, either by visiting neighboring northeastern China or through the foreign books and videos that were inevitably smuggled in. The Soviet Union’s collapse presented North Korea with another existential problem: It no longer had a superpower patron to protect it. Sure, China had an interest in keeping the Korean peninsula divided, but by the 1990s it had little love for North Korea, and would only do so much to protect it from a   world that was openly hostile to the Kim regime.    Kim Jong Il’s solution was something called the Songun or ”military first” policy. This policy tells North Koreans that the reason they are hungry and impoverished and locked in a police state is because this is all necessary to fund the military and protect the country from enemies internal and external, so as to keep them safe from the imperialist Americans who are always just on the verge of invading  —   and, if able, would surely overwhelm them and do unspeakable things. The Songun policy rallies North Koreans behind the regime not despite but because of their poverty, which is said to be a necessary function of the   war against the imperialist American dogs. But keeping this lie alive requires the occasional provocation, just enough to make it look like North Koreans are indeed in a state of   and also that the North Korean leaders are bravely and boldly lashing out against their enemies. In that sense, it’s all a show for the North Korean people, meant to maintain the big lie that keeps the country running  —   a terrifying,     war with the evil Americans and other enemies. These provocations, since the   when Songun began, have often been conducted in some form of nuclear weapons work, and Kim Jong Il’s son,   Kim Jong Un, has carried on this tradition. It’s far from the only reason the country works with nuclear weapons, but it’s an important one for understanding the threats. 2) It’s about countering enemies that Kim knows are more powerful             The immediate context is helpful here: This week, the United Nations Security Council passed some of the toughest North Korea sanctions in years. Even China supported the sanctions, which it had helped to draft, and which punish North Korea’s nuclear test from this January and a missile test from February. When punished like this, North Korea often responds with provocations much like Thursday’s nuclear threat.    It’s not that Kim Jong Un actually desires a war with his enemies. His military, he knows, is antiquated and inferior and would certainly lose. Rather, what he likely wants to do, at least in part, is to raise tensions in the region  —   knowing that the US and North Korea’s neighbors will then look to ratchet them down. At the risk of insulting Kim Jong Un, it helps to think of North Korea’s provocations as somewhat akin to a child throwing a temper tantrum. He might do lots of shouting, make some    declarations (”I’m never going back to school again”) and even throw a punch or two. Still, you give the child the attention he craves and maybe even a toy, not because you think the threats are real or because he deserves it, but because you want the tantrum to stop. The big problem here is not that North Korea will intentionally start a nuclear war, but rather that its threats, however empty, significantly raise the risk of unwanted conflict. It’s disruptive and dangerous. When North Korea fired six missiles into the sea this week, for example, no one thought South Korea was at danger of annihilation. But it does carry some real risks to have missiles crashing off your coast. Kim knows that his neighbors are more sensitive to this danger and disruption than he is. It falls to North Korea’s neighbors and to the US, then, to keep the Korean peninsula from spiraling out of control. Even if they don’t ultimately offer Kim concessions to calm him down, as they have in the past, they’ve still got an interest in preventing future outbursts. Like parents straining to manage a child’s tantrum, it’s a power dynamic that oddly favors the weak and misbehaving. 3) Provocations play well in North Korean internal politics             Imagine being in your late 20s and suddenly taking control of a small country, one whose government is dominated by a small and ruthless coterie of more experienced military and party officials. Probably one of your biggest concerns would be making sure that those officials took you seriously  —   that they followed your orders and didn’t remove you outright.    This has been Kim Jong Un’s challenge since taking over from his father in early 2012: how to consolidate power among the country’s governing elites. And he seems to have gone about this in two ways. First, he has launched one of North Korea’s most violent political purges in decades, exiling or executing a number of   officials, most infamously carving some up with   gun fire. (This has been apparently confirmed with satellite imagery, unlike the almost certainly false story of Kim feeding his uncle to wild dogs.) And, second, Kim has conducted a steady series of military provocations: nuclear development, weapons tests, and a series of threats, in early 2013, to start World War III. A common theory among North Korea analysts is that this allows Kim to prove to military officials that he’s a capable leader, and also that it rallies officials and citizens alike around him. It seems unlikely that internal politics are the primary motivator in this case, though they’re important for understanding Kim Jong Un’s tendency for big provocations. Given that the nuclear threat came in response to UN Security Council sanctions, it’s probably aimed mostly in response to that, both as a message to North Korea’s enemies and to reassure its citizenry.

132563,199839,Why the number of threats against abortion providers skyrocketed in 2015,Vox,Emily Crockett,2016/4/5,2016.0,4.0,http://www.vox.com/2016/4/5/11369474/abortion-violence-2015-planned-parenthood-videos," After an   group released doctored videos attacking Planned Parenthood last summer, the FBI noticed a significant uptick in violence and threats against abortion providers  —   including a deadly shooting at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood.    And now, startling new data from the National Abortion Federation (NAF) shows just how massive that uptick was.            NAF, the professional association of abortion providers in America, collects data from its members on violent incidents and threats. Of course, the Colorado shooting caused a spike in the number of murders and attempted murders at abortion clinics in 2015. But the increase of death threats and online hate speech against abortion providers from 2014 to 2015 was simply staggering, and suggests the Colorado Springs shooting didn’t happen in a vacuum.               After the CEO of a tissue procurement organization was featured in one of the anti —  Planned Parenthood videos, one person said online that the CEO ”should be hung by the neck using piano wire and propped up on the lawn in front of the building,” according to NAF’s report. The person then identified where the CEO lived, and said he’d ”pay ten grand” to whomever killed either the CEO or another doctor he named. The FBI investigated, and the person who made the threats is being prosecuted. Clinic blockades also doubled from 2014 to 2015, and picketing outside abortion facilities quadrupled. NAF notes that it hired an outside security firm to keep track of online threats because there were so many of them. That firm only started counting in   though, and the   incidents were recorded over just six weeks. NAF estimates that the number would be more like 100, 000 if it had been counting since the videos came out in July.    ”In my more than 20 years with NAF, I have not seen such an escalation of hate speech, threats, and calls to action against abortion providers,” said Vicki Saporta, president and CEO of NAF, in a statement. ”It’s not surprising that when abortion providers are publicly branded as ’murderers’ who must be stopped, that someone will take the law into their own hands and resort to violence.”  Watch: The Planned Parenthood controversy, explained      "
133531,201470,"What 50,000 Swedish twins can teach us about education and longevity",Vox,Brian Resnick,2016/8/2,2016.0,8.0,http://www.vox.com/2016/8/2/12230112/swedish-twins-teach-about-education-longevity," Studies consistently find that people with more education tend to live longer. But scientists aren’t exactly sure why.     One explanation could be that they’re richer and thus have more money to invest in their health. Or maybe there’s just something intrinsically special about people who stay in school longer. Perhaps they’re smarter, more resilient. Those qualities could easily help them live longer, healthier lives.  But that isn’t a satisfying answer because we  —   mostly  —   can’t control our genes and the environments we’re born into. There’s another hypothesis for why school may yield longer lives. It’s that education builds “human capital,” or a systematic way of thinking that benefits every decision. Those tiny good decisions add up to a protective factor that helps you live longer.     “Education is likely to provide general human capital that can be used to maintain and improve health in a wide range of circumstances,” David Cutler, Angus Deaton, and Adriana    —   Harvard and Princeton economists  —   write in a 2006 paper in the Journal of Economic Perspectives. This human capital, they say, will aid   survival “whenever there exists a mechanism or technology that more knowledgeable and educated people can use to improve their health. ”    A new study from researchers in Sweden adds compelling evidence to the human capital argument. Its main conclusion: People with higher levels of schooling (more than 13 years) live around three years longer than people with less schooling (under 10 years) after controlling for biology and childhood environment.  Three years is a long time. It’s comparable to the average difference in longevity between men and women, the authors of the study, published recently in Demography, explain. It’s also the same as the gain in longevity from quitting smoking or getting a kidney transplant at age 60 or older.     What 50, 000 Swedish twins can tell us about schooling and longevity The researchers couldn’t run an experiment to determine if education matters for longevity. That would require taking identical groups of people, giving one group more years of schooling than the other, and then tracking outcomes for the rest of their lives. Luckily, however, they weren’t completely helpless. Nature provides a natural experiment through which researchers can look for answers: twins. Studying identical twins allows researcher to more finely control for factors like IQ, personality, and home environment that can contribute to longevity. A big enough data set would allow the researchers to compare twin pairs and ask a simple question: If one twin gets more education than the other, does that twin live longer?   Doubly lucky was that in Sweden, there’s an absurdly dense treasure trove of twin data.     The Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm houses a registry of data on more than 85, 000 twin pairs  —   the largest such repository in the world. The research team mined 50, 000 of those twins (18, 000 of which were identical) to help answer this question of school on education. The study combined the twin data set with public records on mortality and educational attainment. The researchers even took extra steps to control for differences between the identical twins, adjusting for birth weight and height  —   which roughly correlate with childhood health and intelligence  —   in the analysis. (“By no means is this a perfect solution,” the authors note.) Controlling as best they can for these variables, the researchers found a significant and persistent impact of education on longevity. This was true for both genders.  This sounds too good to be true. What’s the catch?  The data set used in this survey is huge and comprehensive, but it comes with a huge caveat. The 50, 000 twins were born a long, long time ago  —   between 1886 and 1958. Back in the early 20th century, schooling wasn’t as common as it is today, so it’s hard to know if the results can generalize into the modern world. (That the data is so old contains an advantage too, as the researchers were able to track the impact of schooling over entire lifetimes. At the least, it’s interesting to learn that for the late 19th and early 20th centuries, schooling was important for lifelong wellbeing, at least in Sweden)    The researchers, however, suggest one tangible way the data can inform education policies today, particularly in the 136 countries whose residents get, on average, less than 10 years of schooling, according to the most recent data from the United Nations. (It’s a reminder most kids around the world don’t actually have a choice about how long they get to stay in school. They drop out because they have to work, or because there’s no affordable school nearby.) But maybe the link between school and longevity can help persuade governments to invest more in education where it’s lacking. “Our results therefore suggest that the longevity gains from extending levels of schooling in these countries may be substantial,” the study authors write. “Such gains and improved health may well constitute important mechanisms by which schooling also affects productivity and economic growth, which would further emphasize the crucial role of schooling in the development of human welfare. ”  It’s also entirely possible that schooling matters more than ever for     as the authors note that the “socioeconomic gradient in mortality has grown stronger over time. ”  These findings dovetail nicely with some other small but compelling evidence that finds school can increase a person’s IQ. Analyses have found evidence that each additional year in school adds 3. 7 IQ points. And great IQ is also associated with longevity.  The gap between the rich and poor in longevity continues to widen. If school is the ticket to a higher social class, it may still be the ticket to a longer life.  "
134005,202362,"The sudden, incredible decline in teen births since 2009",Vox,Sarah Kliff,2016/9/28,2016.0,9.0,http://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/9/28/13074822/teen-birth-decline-2015," Teen births hit a new low in 2015  —   and have fallen by nearly half over the past seven years.    New federal data shows there were 22. 3 births for every 1, 000 girls ages 15 to 19. That’s a 47 percent decline from the teen birthrate in 2009  —   and a 64 percent decline from the teen birthrate in 1991.         The reduction in teen births is arguably one of the biggest public health victories of the 21st century. It’s rare to see such significant changes in a health metric in just a few years. Imagine if obesity rates, for example, tumbled 40 percent in seven years. That’s what’s happening with teen births. The decline in teen births is happening across different racial groups, too. The birthrate for black and Hispanic teenagers is still above average but has dropped significantly over the past two decades, and especially since 2009.         Birth control helps explain the huge decline in teen births  —   and might explain all of it The decline in teen pregnancy has been an incredibly fast change in a public health trend, and it’s left some researchers puzzled over how it happened so quickly.       But researchers Laura Lindberg, John Santelli, and Sheila Desai say it’s not a mystery at all. Writing in the Journal of Adolescent Health, they find that teenage girls in 2012 were just as likely to be sexually active as girls in 2007. Survey research shows that 43 percent of girls ages 15 to 19 said they’d ever had sex in 2007, compared with 45 percent in 2012.         What changed was how teenage girls used contraceptives. The share of sexually active teens who used at least one type of birth control the last time they had sex rose from 78 percent in 2007 to 86 percent in 2012. More teens gravitated toward better types of birth control  —   like pills, IUDs, or implants  —   rather than relying on   birth control like condoms.    This study only included data through 2012, and, as the researchers note, it’s possible the narrative could be changing. Newer data that runs through 2015 is starting to show a decline in sexual activity among teenage girls. ”It is unclear whether these new data represent a new trend or are the result of other factors,” the study authors write of the new figures.    But if this is the start of a decline in sexual activity among teenage girls, that could help explain why the teen birthrate has fallen even faster in recent years  —   and why it might continue to plummet in the future.

134098,202517,The final debate showed that neither Trump nor Clinton know how to talk about Iraq,Vox,Yochi Dreazen,2016/10/7,2016.0,10.0,http://www.vox.com/world/2016/10/7/13199774/trump-clinton-iraq-syria-isis," Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both talk tough about stepping up the fight against ISIS and finding a way to reduce Syria’s carnage. The problem is that neither one has a clear explanation of how they’d do it.    During the final presidential debate Wednesday night, Clinton struggled to square her repeated promises not to send ground troops back into Iraq with the cold reality that the Obama administration already has nearly 5, 000 US forces on the ground there. Trump, for his part, refused to give a clear answer about whether his promise to ”bomb the hell out of ISIS” meant that he would be willing to send even larger numbers of American troops into the fight. The muddled messages were an echo of the vice presidential debate from earlier this month where a flurry of insults, interruptions, and outright lies helped obscure a pair of unintentionally revealing exchanges. When Trump running mate Mike Pence blamed Clinton for the rise of ISIS, because she’d ”failed to renegotiate a forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq,” Clinton’s running mate, Tim Kaine, shot back: ”Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that.”    Pence didn’t. Later, the Republican took implicit aim at Kaine’s boasts that Clinton had helped to wind down the massively unpopular Iraq War. ”The president just ordered more troops on the ground,” Pence said. ”We are back at war in Iraq.” This time it was Kaine who had no response.    The failure to articulate a clear message about Iraq and Syria isn’t just a political problem for Clinton and Trump as they prepare for Sunday night’s debate. It’s also a substantive challenge, and one with significant   consequences. Come January, one of them will be commander in chief. That means they won’t just have to figure out how to talk about the wars there. They’ll have to decide what to do about them. Trump’s Iraq and Syria strategies have a great big hole in the center In the vice presidential debate, Pence called for establishing ”safe zones” in Syria where refugees fleeing the fighting in places like Aleppo could find shelter. Trump also supports the idea, though in characteristic fashion he believes Persian Gulf allies should pay for it.    That sounds innocuous enough on the surface. The problem comes when you actually look at what establishing and protecting a safe zone in Syria would require. You’d need American aircraft to patrol the skies  —   which could easily lead to situations where the US had to down Syrian (and potentially even Russian) warplanes and helicopters before they could strike civilians on the ground  —   and you’d need what could be significant numbers of US ground troops to help set up, maintain, and guard the safe zone itself. That’s not armchair analysis. In July 2013, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the   of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sent a letter to Capitol Hill Michigan warning that creating a   zone would cost $500 million to set up and at least $1 billion a month to operate, and could result in US planes being downed. He said that establishing  —   and then protecting  —   humanitarian corridors designed to give Syrian civilians safe shelter from Assad’s forces would require thousands of American ground troops. So far, it’s unclear whether Trump and Pence would actually be willing to send the US troops needed to make this happen. GOP hawks like John McCain and Lindsey Graham have called for the deployment of up to 20, 000 troops, more than triple the amount currently in the two countries, but Trump has repeatedly contradicted himself on the issue. In March, he said he’d be willing to send ”20, 000 to 30, 000” more troops to fight ISIS. In July, he reversed course and said he’d actually have ”very few troops on the ground.”    ”When it comes to both Iraq and Syria, many Republicans talk a tough game but don’t actually admit it would require more US forces,” said Ilan Goldenberg of the Center for a New American Security, formerly a top Pentagon Middle East policy official. ”The most striking example has been Trump and Pence’s position on Syria, where they’ve both called for a safe zone in Syria but don’t acknowledge this actually requires American forces.” Michael O’Hanlon, a senior defense and foreign affairs analyst at the Brookings Institution, said that Pence’s safe zone proposal seemed to echo earlier comments from Clinton, who has been talking about such a move for months. O’Hanlon said that Pence also ”basically supported putting ground troops in position to defend those safe zones”  —   something the Trump campaign rarely discusses so explicitly. ”I think [Pence] is totally right  —   and totally out of step with his running mate,” O’Hanlon said. Clinton believes ground troops in Iraq are somehow not really ground troops in Iraq Clinton’s Iraq policy suffers from a similar, though slightly different, problem. Last month, Clinton bluntly said that ”we’re not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again.” That may come as a surprise to the families of the roughly 5, 000 US troops already on the ground in Iraq, a number poised to grow by at least 500 in coming weeks. The former secretary of state is trying to be too cute by half. She’s arguing that the thousands of US troops who are on the ground in Iraq to train and advise Iraqi and Kurdish forces aren’t technically ground combat troops, even though they’re deployed to an active war zone, regularly exchange fire with enemy forces, and have suffered casualties. ”When she talks about how there won’t be ground troops in Iraq, she means there won’t be significant numbers of American troops there at the pointy end of the spear,” said Derek Chollet, a former senior Obama administration official who strongly backs Clinton. ”Of course troops serving in Iraq can be in harm’s way. But the missions they’re doing aren’t combat operations.”    Still, Chollet acknowledged that the distinction can get lost in the final frantic weeks before the election. ”It’s really hard to talk about nuanced policy in the heat of the campaign,” he said. ”The nuance matters, and it often just gets lost.” That may be true, but it simply serves as a reminder of Clinton’s lingering Iraq problem. Clinton can describe them however she wants to, but the cold hard truth is that the US has sent ground troops back into Iraq. And if we’ve learned anything over the past 13 years of fighting, it’s this: Putting Americans into Iraq is a lot easier than pulling them out. Sunday night’s debate will be moderated by CNN’s Anderson Cooper and ABC’s Martha Raddatz, both of whom have spent extensive amounts of time reporting on Iraq and Syria and making trips to the region. That means Trump and Clinton are each likely to face questions about their strategies for the conflicts there. And it’s a reminder that the clock is ticking to the moment one of them will need to actually put their plan in place. "
134216,202735,What caused Friday’s internet outage,Vox,Timothy B. Lee,2016/10/21,2016.0,10.0,http://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/10/21/13357332/internet-outage-explained," Since this morning, many internet users have had trouble reaching dozens of major websites, including Twitter, Reddit, Spotify, and CNN. The culprit seems to be an attack on the domain name system, or DNS, a   part of infrastructure that plays a crucial role online.    DNS acts as the internet’s directory service. It keeps track of who owns websites like Google. com and Vox. com and gives your computer the IP address it needs to connect with them directly. This morning, someone  —   it’s not clear who  —   began flooding a popular DNS provider, called Dyn, with fake traffic. The attack overwhelmed its servers and brought DNS service to a grinding halt for a few hours. Dyn says it resolved the problem this morning but the attacks resumed later in the day. When your computer tries to connect to a site like Twitter, its first step is to do a DNS query to find out the numeric IP address for Twitter’s server. But if the site uses Dyn as its DNS provider, your computer may not have gotten a response. So even though Twitter’s web servers might have been working perfectly, you wouldn’t have been able to read the site.    Not every user had problems this morning. One reason is that most internet service providers run their own DNS servers that keep local copies of frequently accessed domains. If Twitter’s main DNS server isn’t responding, your computer  —   or a computer run by your ISP  —   may still know Twitter’s IP address because it looked up the address a few hours earlier. "
134298,202879,The latest Trump tape accidentally explains rape culture in less than 3 minutes,Vox,Emily Crockett,2016/10/29,2016.0,10.0,http://www.vox.com/identities/2016/10/29/13465600/trump-miss-universe-tape-rape-culture-grab-kiss-onstage," On Friday, a new video surfaced that showed Donald Trump doing to former Miss Universe Jennifer Hawkins  —   in public, onstage in front of thousands of people  —   the same thing that he bragged about doing on a leaked audio tape with Billy Bush of Access Hollywood.     On that now infamous 2005 tape, Trump said of beautiful women: “I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. ” And that’s just what Trump does to Hawkins at the end of this video from a 2011 business conference in Sydney, Australia, which was first reported by the Huffington Post’s Ryan Grim:   In the video, Trump calls Hawkins onstage for a disturbing display of public humiliation, including sex jokes at her expense, for a perceived slight that Hawkins says was a misunderstanding. Hawkins laughs and apologizes, and Trump also laughs as if it’s all in good fun  —   but he still makes insulting, degrading remarks about her in an apparent act of revenge.  And after he’s done with all that, Trump says, “I don’t know too many women who are taller than me,” puts his arm around Hawkins’s waist, grabs her close to him, and goes in for a kiss. It doesn’t look consensual or expected; Hawkins appears to put her arm between them and turn her head so the kiss lands on her cheek. The audience laughs, and there are a few cheers and whistles. “Can I sit down now?” Hawkins asks.     I heard a lot of feedback from readers who were shocked by this tape, and with good reason. It’s just about everything wrong with Trump and women in less than three minutes: He casually objectifies a woman, cruelly displays his dominance and power over her, and gives her a surprise    that looks a lot like moments other women have described while accusing Trump of sexual assault.     But a lot of other readers, both Trump supporters and not, genuinely seemed to think it was no big deal:   @emilycrockett @voxdotcom I hate trump as much as any sane person. .. but this video does not show much —   ynreee (@ynreeeee) October 28, 2016      @emilycrockett @voxdotcom the video literally showed NOTHING. And this is not because i support him, it’s from 2 eyes. It showed nothing —   Jaxon J. (@Jaxon4Trump) October 28, 2016      @voxdotcom Is that all      have got? He goes in for a peck on the cheek she half wasn’t expecting happens all the time —   An Individual (@Citizen751908) October 28, 2016    Normally, I might dismiss comments like these. But in this case, I think they speak to an important point that’s worth unpacking.     Again: Trump did this to Hawkins  —   humiliated her, made sexual jokes about her, and kissed her without warning  —   onstage in front of thousands of people. He clearly thought there was nothing wrong with his actions. So, it seems, did many of the people in the audience.  Trump’s infamous “grab ’em by the pussy” tape caught fire in part because it was so shocking. But the terrible truth about Trump’s alleged crimes is that sexual misconduct is so common  —   so routine  —   that a lot of people don’t even know it when they see it. If you think you don’t know a woman who has been sexually harassed or assaulted, you either don’t know many women or the women you do know have simply never chosen to confide in you about things like this.     Research by Indiana University professor Carol Brooks Gardner surveyed women on their experiences with being harassed by unknown men in public  —   and found that every woman surveyed reported more than one such experience (and that only a tiny minority of these women, nine out of 293, didn’t find those experiences “troublesome”). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 percent of women and 11 percent of men have experienced some form of unwanted sexual contact in their lifetime.  When the Trump tapes inspired author Kelly Oxford to tweet about her first sexual assault and encourage other women to do the same, she was inundated with responses at the rate of at least one per second for at least the next day. And when I wrote about that, women I know started telling me about experiences they’d kept to themselves for years.  There are plenty of reasons women don’t often talk openly about this stuff, even though so many women experience sexual harassment or assault so frequently.  But one of the biggest, dumbest reasons? We’ve been raised to expect that this kind of thing happens all the time. That it’s no big deal if a guy casually gropes you at a bar, or that it’s flattering if he gives you a kiss you weren’t expecting.    But most depressingly: being assaulted, grabbed, groped, etc is not an unusual occurrence for women. It happens throughout our lives —   Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) October 13, 2016      We’re taught that being catcalled & groped is an expected part of a woman’s life. (Boys will be boys!) How do you report the everyday? —   Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) October 13, 2016    Trump really, truly seems to think that it’s no big deal to plant a kiss without warning on any woman he finds attractive. He dismissed his leaked comments about kissing women without consent, not to mention grabbing them “by the pussy,” as “locker room talk. ” But the truth is a lot of people think the same way Trump does about women’s bodies  —   even if they also claim to abhor rape and sexual assault. (Trump sure says he does; recall that he wanted to execute the men who were found innocent of   a woman in Central Park.)    A lot of people think that women’s bodies aren’t entirely our own, and that we are always at least partially available for someone else’s enjoyment. That’s what we talk about when we talk about rape culture.  This attitude toward women’s bodies is why beauty pageants are popular, and probably one reason Trump loved owning them  —   they’re the closest thing we have to an institutionalized version of his attitudes toward women. Like Trump, beauty pageants judge women’s worth based on their physical attractiveness (“She’s no longer a 10”) and reduce women to public objects that can be paraded around and ogled by men.  This attitude is why Billy Bush  —   who was at least as bad as Trump in that tape, if you watch the whole thing  —   thought it was fine and normal to pressure Arianne Zucker into giving both him and Trump a hug, and to prod her on whether she’d pick Bush or Trump to go on a date with if she had to choose.  Like Hawkins, Zucker laughed   at Bush’s comments. And it’s completely possible that either or both of these women genuinely didn’t mind or think anything of it, or even enjoyed the banter.  But just because a woman laughs doesn’t mean that what’s going on is okay. Women laugh when men do something inappropriate all the time; I certainly have.  We laugh because we’re uncomfortable. We laugh because we think it’s what men want to hear, and we don’t want to be mean. We laugh because we think it’s the best way to diffuse an awkward situation  —   or to maneuver out of a dangerous one.  And maybe we laugh because we think it’s funny or harmless. But we also laugh because we are taught, every day, to believe that it’s normal.  "
134786,203733,This professor set off a war of words over “identity politics.” We debated him.,Vox,Sean Illing,2016/12/16,2016.0,12.0,http://www.vox.com/conversations/2016/12/16/13924742/mark-lilla-identity-politics-liberalism-trump-clinton-race-2016-election," When Hillary Clinton lost the presidency to Donald Trump, the left started grasping for an explanation.     Mark Lilla, a liberal political theorist at Columbia University and author of The Shipwrecked Mind, offered one in a New York Times essay published shortly after the election: The Clinton campaign spent too much time appealing to what he calls “identity liberalism. ”  Lilla’s thesis is that the left’s exaltation of diversity is “a splendid principle of moral pedagogy, but disastrous as a foundation for democratic politics in our ideological age. ”  In this election, Lilla argues, Clinton was “at her best and most uplifting when she spoke about American interests in world affairs and how they relate to our understanding of democracy. ”     However, according to Lilla, Clinton too often would “slip into the rhetoric of diversity, calling out explicitly to   Latino, L. G. B. T. and women voters. ”     This, he writes, was a strategic error because it excluded the white working class, which was a large part of why Clinton lost the election.  The response to Lilla’s essay was fierce. Slate’s Michelle Goldberg argued his reduction of identity politics confuses the “absurd excesses of political correctness” with “race and gender politics themselves. ” Vox’s Matthew Yglesias made a vital point: “The reality is that politics is not and will never be a public policy seminar. People have identities, and people are mobilized politically around those identities. There is no other way to do politics than to do identity politics. ”    The most dismissive rejoinder was from Katherine Franke, a law professor at Columbia University, who compared Lilla to David Duke and charged him with “underwriting the whitening of American nationalism, and the   of white lives as the lives that matter most in the U. S. ” If nothing else, Franke’s screed did stumble into a relevant point: America was founded on a system of white supremacy, and contemporary liberalism is a necessary corrective to this. Whether you agree that “identity liberalism” is a problem or not, this is a conversation the left needs to have. The sword of identity politics cuts both ways. A reliance on   coalitions on one side will invariably produce an upsurge in identity politics on the other.  Trump’s success is too complicated to be captured by a single framework of analysis, but the triumph of white identity politics was a crucial factor. I’m not convinced the left is to blame for this. America is a big country with plenty of racists and xenophobes; those racists and xenophobes exist independent of the Democratic Party.     White identity politics, moreover, if not invented was certainly perfected by the Ku Klux Klan, long before progressives started making noises about equality.  Nevertheless, a strategic question has to be posed: Are Democrats, by relying so heavily on   coalitions, undermining their own political project? Would they be better served by elevating issues over identities? Perhaps so.   But the fact remains: Identity is bound up with politics; Republicans, particularly with Trump at the helm, are pushing their own brand of identity conservatism; and liberals have an obligation to defend the targets of exclusion.  On Wednesday, I reached out to Lilla to hear his response to the criticism. I also wanted to press him on a few of the questionable claims he made in his New York Times essay. Our conversation didn’t resolve any of the problems, but hopefully it elucidated some of the challenges. Sean Illing I think we ought to define this phrase “identity politics” at the top. What does this mean in your mind? Mark Lilla Well, the term I’ve been using is ”identity liberalism,” and that’s important because identity liberalism, in my view, is a kind of   that, despite whatever one thinks of the claims being made, distracts attention away from issues and focuses it on questions of personal identity or social recognition.    Now, these are important questions, but they’re not, strictly speaking, political questions. They take our attention off of what politics in a democracy is about, namely acquiring and using power by occupying institutions. And you can only do that by winning elections at every level of government and by staying elected.  My view is that the only way to accomplish this is to present the principles of liberalism in a way that as many people as possible in the country can affirm them and feel that they resonate with those principles. So I say identity liberalism is a   because those engaged with it think they’re doing politics, and they are doing a kind of movement politics, but the core aim of political action in a liberal democracy is not to speak truth to power but to acquire power, and that requires persuasion and appeals to commonalities.  Sean Illing I’ve argued that all politics is identity politics insofar as politics involves the assertion of values in the public sphere. If you grant that values are bound up with identity, it’s not clear to me how you circumnavigate this problem.  Vox’s Matthew Yglesias made a similar point in his response to your piece, which is that politics is not  —   and has never been  —   a public policy seminar. People have identities, and they’re mobilized around those identities. And so, as Yglesias wrote, “there is no other way to do politics than to do identity politics. ” Mark Lilla To begin with, identity can be used to mobilize people for political action  —   that’s for sure. But political action is something else. I certainly agree that someone’s identity may affect their political views. Again, though, democratic politics is about persuasion. It’s not about  .  However you come to your values or positions, you become political the moment you enter the arena trying to persuade other people of your values. If you have a certain value and you attach to that a whole picture of your identity, and then ask the other person not only to accept your position but to accept your account of your identity, you’re setting the bar very high for political agreement.     If I can convince someone with a very different identity, or someone who doesn’t accept my account of my identity, to agree about certain principles, I can then walk that person down from a principle to a particular case.  Sean Illing Can you explain that last point by way of an example? What would that process look like in practice?  Mark Lilla Here’s an example of the kind of argument you’d make: Black motorists are being targeted and mistreated by American police officers  —   we know this. If my principle here is equal protection under the law, and I want to convince someone who doesn’t know black people or doesn’t particularly care about the black experience, if I want to persuade that person to get engaged and care about this issue, I can do one of two things. I can get that person to agree to the principle of equal protection under the law, and then I can walk them down to saying that black motorists, as citizens, deserve to be protected.  If, on the other hand, I try to persuade that person of a certain picture of the black experience today and the injustices of the country, or what it’s like to be black or how I define myself as black, I’ve made my job much harder and increased the odds, fairly or not, that they’ll reject my message. So I think identity politics mixes the work of social reform, which has to do with recognition and incorporation and diversity, with the work of political action, which requires political speech that encourages people to agree with you. Sean Illing I understand the strategic and rhetorical point you’re making, but there’s still the fact of identity as an instrument of mobilization, which is being used mercilessly by Trump at the moment. And I think that’s part of the conundrum here: All this talk of identity politics on the left seems to ignore the fact that identity politics on the right is every bit as pervasive, and has a much longer history.    Mark Lilla One can argue about which side committed to identity politics first, but it’s a fact that Democrats have been out of power in terms of holding on to public sentiment since 1980. Reaganism offered a picture of what the country was that we’ve not been able to replace.  If people are withdrawn into their identities, you’re writing off a whole group of people that you need to reach if you want to be elected. White people are still the majority group. If someone is withdrawn into his or her identity, the only way out of that is to appeal to something that they already agree with. Again, I’m talking strategy here. I’m sick of losing, and I’m sick to death of noble defeats. Sean Illing Let’s talk about elections in that case. You’ve seen the data showing how significant racial resentment was among Trump voters. Your contention is that this is largely a reaction against identity liberalism. But the country is in fact changing. It is becoming less white. It is, like the rest of the world, becoming more cosmopolitan. It is not the homogeneous and   culture of the ’50s.  How do we know the “whitelash” isn’t a predictable and unavoidable reaction to these realities? Mark Lilla We’d have to do a lot of survey research to get at not only what people’s attitudes are but what motivated them to vote in a certain way. It’s always going to be overdetermined because people are going to give you various reasons, any one of which could have been sufficient for them to vote as they did.    Certainly resentment about identity discourse was part of this. One would have to untangle that a bit to know with any precision how determinative it was, but it’s clear that it was a factor.  I’ll say this, however. The white working class that drifted away from Democrats, beginning in the ’70s: These people in their daily lives are not living in the world that you described. You’re describing the world that you and I live in because we’re educated and we live in urban areas. Many of these people don’t. They live in relatively homogeneous places, with some immigrants but nothing like you find in major cities. They live in areas that, residentially at least, are largely segregated. So your model of the world is not the world in which many Americans live in day to day. There is the mixed, cosmopolitan world that comes to them through media, and that can feel alien to someone outside it. And if we want to understand why Democrats have lost people in these communities, why they’re voting against their own interests, we have to consider all of this. The bottom line is that we can’t win without these people. And when I’m talking about winning, I’m not just talking about presidential elections  —   we pay too much attention to that. The things that get done in this country are done through legislation, which means you have to win the Congress and you have to go every state in the country. The laws, moreover, get enforced in state governments, and so you if you’re not competitive there, you can’t guarantee that the laws you pass will get enforced. So if we care about the people we say we care about  —   African Americans, women, LGBT people, Latinos  —   if we want to protect them, symbolic victories won’t do. We have to be competitive and we have to win at every level of government, and that means sucking it up and getting the votes of everyone. Sean Illing Does ”sucking it up” mean pandering to cultural angst or nativist fears? Because that’s what the other side does, and it didn’t start with Trump. Appeals to black or Latino identity are dismissed as identity politics, but stories about “welfare queens” or Obama’s secret Kenyan identity are playing the same game on the other side, only in a more vulgar form.    Mark Lilla I don’t dispute your point about identity politics on the right. My focus is on what to do moving forward, on how to win. No, you don’t have to appeal to the angst and nativist fears. My point is that you appeal to principles so you get them off this subject of identity. And the two basic principles of liberalism are equal protection under the law and social solidarity. Sean Illing To be clear: I do think that the politically correct bullshit has gone too far, especially on college campuses, and that that has driven people away. But I’m not convinced that this  —   or identity liberalism in general  —   is the primary reason for the wave of reactionary politics we’re seeing, though perhaps it’s a bigger factor than I thought.  Everyone, no matter where they live, can see that the culture is changing. There is among the rural white working class a nostalgia for a bygone world  —   a whiter and simpler world  —   and that world is gone, and it’s not coming back. But Republicans dangle the possibility of its return as a way to appeal to this underlying angst. I’m not so sure that liberals can overcome this with the broad appeals to shared principles that you recommend, though I concede I might be wrong about that. Mark Lilla Well, your pessimism must be right, but my article was about political strategy. Let’s say what you just said is true. These issues were lurking beneath the surface, and a demagogue came along and he pushed every button, and they became nostalgic in the way that you described. Okay, then that’s where we are. So we have two jobs now. One is social reform, and that means winning hearts and minds, and that happens through schools and churches and television and universities. There are all sorts of ways we can work to make America more tolerant and inclusive. But we can’t confuse that work with political work. Political work is only about acquiring and using power to protect the people you want to protect.    An election is not a seminar. It is not a therapy session. It is not a chance to rewrite history. An election is only about winning, and you do what you have to do. And yes, that doesn’t mean you have to pander to people, but it may mean you have to be silent about certain things and get your apron dirty.  If you want to reform the American soul, become a minister. But if you’re serious about politics, you have to go where the people are and find a way to reach them, and not be afraid to get dirty. Sean Illing You say that Democrats should focus more on broad economic themes that appeal to everyone, especially the white working class, and not just identity concerns. But the response you get from most people on the left is that economic populism and identity politics aren’t mutually exclusive, and in fact are inextricably linked.  Mark Lilla Well, I’m not talking about economic populism. I think we have to focus on these issues insofar as we have leverage there. What I’m talking about is more ambitious. Consider Reagan, whose optimism points to the power of a view of a good collective life. JFK electrified a generation in this way. FDR did the same thing. But now the shining city on the hill is a Rust Belt town where all the shops are shuttered and people are working   jobs for less money. What’s needed is a different picture of what we are as a country, something that raises people out of themselves.  And that’s what Democrats need to offer above all else.     Sean Illing That’s all fine and well, but that’s not the whole Reagan story. Reagan absolutely played the identity game. It wasn’t all rainbows and sunshine and a shining city on a glittering hill. There was also the fearmongering and the racial pandering and the “welfare queen” rhetoric.  Hell, he hired the master racist dog whistler Lee Atwater, whose raison d’être was helping Republicans appeal to racists without sounding racist. That was as much a reason for his success as anything else. Mark Lilla I accept everything you said except for the bit about that being a decisive factor in his success. In any case, you may not be old enough to remember what it was like during the Carter years. There was no sense of what the country was or what it could do. And then someone came along with this towering idea of America, and people absolutely responded to it.  But no doubt there was also the pandering and strategic capitulations you mentioned. Sean Illing One of your colleagues at Columbia, Katherine Franke, argues that you’ve trivialized the “identity drama” on the left by diminishing the concrete concerns and structural disadvantages that made these movements necessary. The complaint, as I understand it, is that there’s an inherent inequality baked into the pre —  civil rights era of liberalism you praise in your essay, and ignoring that undercuts your argument. Mark Lilla To begin with, Professor Franke didn’t have an argument. Her piece was a slur. But I’ll take up your question. Look, I agree with that picture. I understand that FDR offered a vision of freedom that didn’t apply to African Americans. That’s why we have to keep harping on these principles in order to ensure that they apply to more of us, to everyone.    Someone like Franke, who’s wrapped up in these identity questions, is really asking for recognition of what’s happened. When people ask me to recognize any of these injustices, I eagerly accept them. Again, my point was strategic and political: Do we run on this? No, we run on something else. We run on something that wins, and then we make the country most just and equal. Sean Illing Another concern I’ve heard on the left, and this was articulated nicely by Slate’s Michelle Goldberg, is that you’ve conflated the illiberal excesses of the “social justice warriors” with race and gender politics as such, and these are not the same things. Do you take this point at all? Mark Lilla I want to distinguish political discourse from general cultural discourse. In general cultural discourse, there’s a lot to be said about race and gender, and talking about it has led to extraordinarily positive changes. Making these arguments is critical to mobilizing people, and I didn’t say that in my article. But when it comes to seizing power, that will not win you a single election. It will not pass through the spam filter of Fox News. Appealing to principle is our best chance of passing through the   media filter. Sean Illing In your essay, you say liberals should respond to the legitimate threats to minority groups with a “sense of scale. ” That’s an awfully vague phrase  —   what does it mean?    Mark Lilla I mean it in two senses. One sense is that one of the problems with the development of identity politics in the ’70s is that it was about group identity. Society said you’re a black man; therefore you belong in this category. Or this is how you make love; therefore you’re a homosexual and you belong in that category. A form of identity politics grew up around these categories. But then there was a shift from group identity to personal identity. The problem, however, is that if you’re focused on yourself and not a wider historical horizon, you tend to be more myopic in your concerns. What I did not mean by a ”sense of scale” is that we shouldn’t be responding to all of these injustices that are being committed against women or African Americans or LGBT people.  My point is that we can only protect people if we have power. Sean Illing A party is necessarily a reflection of its constituencies. Many of the   “identity groups” are loyal Democratic voters, and for reasons that have to do with more than their identities. So Democrats can’t risk alienating these (growing) constituencies in an effort to win over swaths of white America that, frankly, are already disposed to vote Republican for cultural reasons. So how do Democrats thread this political needle? Mark Lilla They have to recognize that, historically speaking, this is a new development in the Democratic Party. For a long time, you could divide the party into interests and major issues, i. e. education or labor unions. But what happened after the ’70s is that the party split up into various identity groups with essentially overlapping positions on most of the relevant issues. Republicans, alternatively, are not like this. Before Reagan, the party was split in similar ways. What Reagan delivered was a broad message with a couple of undergirding principles, and the party consolidated into a loose coalition of interests without any   divisions.     Sean Illing Well, much of this is a function of the constituencies themselves. The fact is most of the Republican Party is white, so the lack of diversity is itself a big reason why you don’t see these same coalitions forming.  At any rate, we’re just about out of time, so let me ask you this final question: What does a   liberalism look like? These racial demons have already been unleashed. The reactionaries on the right are already charged up and will not go quietly. So the groups of voters who tend to vote for Democrats are going to be under assault in this country.  How does the Democratic Party defend them without leaving themselves vulnerable to critiques like yours? Mark Lilla Simply put, it has to try to win. Defending people is not something that’s done by setting up a new center for the study of identity at a university. If you actually want to defend people, you must hold power. And to hold power, you must win elections. The logic of this is inexorable. This has to be our focus. I’m as worried about these issues as any of my critics. I want to get to a point where a white   guy in Flint, Michigan, with his lousy water, sees a black man being beaten by police on the television and says to himself, ”That could be me.” I want him to sympathize.  If you drive home the point that we’re all citizens, we’ve got a chance of doing that. But if you make this into a story of black America and white America and ask people to accept this identity or this version of history, you are giving them countless ways to not give a damn.  The only way to reach over that and get people to sympathize with each other is to make them believe that we share something. "

","     A senior aide to President Trump said Sunday that he has no plans to release his tax returns, a marked shift from Trump’s pledge during the campaign to make them public once an audit was completed. “The White House response is that he’s not going to release his tax returns,” said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, on ABC’S “This Week. ” “We litigated this all through the election. ” “People didn’t care,” Conway added. “They voted for him, and let me make this very clear: Most Americans are  —   are very focused on what their tax returns will look like while President Trump is in office, not what his look like. ” Presidents are not required to release their tax returns, but presidents dating back to Richard Nixon have routinely done so voluntarily.   [The White House petitions page is still live. The top one calls for Trump’s tax returns.]   A Washington   poll last week showed that Trump’s continued refusal to release his tax returns continues to be an unpopular decision, with 74 percent of Americans saying he should make the documents public, including 53 percent of Republicans. Conway was questioned about a petition page on the White House website that allows citizens to ask government officials to take up issues of importance to them. Under former president Barack Obama, the White House would give a response to petitions that garnered more than 100, 000 signatures online. As of Sunday evening, a petition for Trump to immediately release his tax returns had received more than 228, 000 signatures. During the campaign and since then, Democrats consistently criticized Trump for not releasing his returns, saying that information was needed to evaluate conflicts that might be posed by his vast business holdings. “You know full well that Trump  —   President Trump and his family are complying with all the ethical rules, everything they need to do to step away from his businesses and be a   president,” said Conway, who previously served as Trump’s campaign manager. As recently as at a press conference this month, Trump pointed to an ongoing audit as the reason he couldn’t release his tax returns. “I’m not releasing the tax returns because as you know they’re under audit,” he said."
135627,204898,National Zoo is suspending its search for an elusive bobcat,Washington Post,Michael E. Ruane,2017-02-01,2017.0,2.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170202002857/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/day-3-zoo-is-suspending-its-search-for-missing-bobcat/2017/02/01/992e735a-e88a-11e6-80c2-30e57e57e05d_story.html
"," Officials at the National Zoo have suspended their search for a   bobcat, named Ollie, who escaped Monday from her enclosure at the Zoo.  For the last two days, a team of zookeepers, police officers at the zoo and rescue experts from the D. C. Humane Rescue Alliance have searched for her, but to no avail.  At a news conference Wednesday, zoo officials said they were ending the active search for Ollie because she remains elusive. Craig Saffoe, curator of great cats at the zoo, said his staff must deal with larger, more dangerous animals in its    duties. The zoo said it had received several reports over the last few days from people saying they had seen Ollie in the Cleveland Park and Woodley Park areas near the zoo.   [Still missing: Ollie, the   bobcat from D. C.’s National Zoo]       (Claritza   Washington Post)   Saffoe said the zoo received a report of the cat under a car about 10 p. m. Tuesday, and that staff and zoo police went to the scene. They “scoured the area for more than 45 minutes,” he said, but no Ollie. “I don’t mean to be pessimistic at all but, we’re looking for a cat who could literally be sitting in a tree right next to us,” Saffoe said. Bobcats are not aggressive to humans, and there is no danger to the public, experts said. Still, 13 nearby schools canceled their outdoor recess Tuesday, out of caution. D. C. school officials said they lifted that ban on Wednesday after they heard from the zoo and were assured “we are no longer in imminent danger. ”  [Ollie the bobcat escapes from the National Zoo]  Even though the active search has ended, zoo officials said, the public should still keep an eye out for Ollie  —   but don’t get near her.  Her fur is mostly gray, with horizontal stripes on her front legs. She also has a short tail, hence the name bobcat.  Ollie could be a threat to small cats and dogs, officials said. “We have to be very pragmatic about how we approach this,” Saffoe said. “We are going to stop sending our staff out to canvas neighborhoods. ” He said they would still respond to tips but “right now we’re entering the next phase of our recovery efforts. ” “We want people to help us,” he said.  Zoo officials said they believe their best chance of catching Ollie is probably “chemical immobilization” with a dart gun. They said they could try to net her if they saw her, but would run the risk of her running away again.  The Zoo said Ollie is spayed and vaccinated and in excellent health. She is a good hunter, has captured small prey in her enclosure in the past, and could thrive in nearby Rock Creek Park. She is about 7 years old. But Val Marler, one of the founders of National Bobcat Research & Rescue, the Texas group that gave the zoo all three of its bobcats for free, said in an email: “We are deeply concerned for Ollie. ” “Unfortunately, when a bobcat has imprinted on humans, it very rarely succeeds in the wild,” she wrote. “She is in a city filled with dangers she knows nothing about and where there is only one kind of end that can happen. ” “My heart breaks knowing this,” she wrote. “But I also understand that everyone is doing everything in their power to bring her home. ”  [D. C. kept schoolkids inside. But Ollie’s most likely shy, experts say.]  Ollie was last seen in her enclosure at 7:30 a. m. Monday. But when keepers came back around 10:40 a. m. to give her breakfast, she was gone. The zoo declared a “code green” for an escaped animal. It is believed that Ollie climbed out of her enclosure, which sits near Rock Creek Park, through a small opening in a mesh net around her area. In an inspection on Monday, zookeepers noticed that one piece of the mesh was broken and that there was a hole that measured about    inches.  It hs since been repaired. Being an adept climber, Ollie would have been capable of climbing and crawling through the hole, experts said, possibly feeling into the heavily wooded adjacent park. Officials believe she is still in the area around the park. Saffoe said there are probably other bobcats in the park, along with coyotes, foxes and feral cats.   [Missing red panda found in Adams Morgan]  Bobcats eat mice, small deer, goats, chickens, rabbits and squirrels. They can run fast, climb well and leap into the air to grab low flying birds. .    Keepers had thought that maybe Ollie would come back to her familiar grounds for food and shelter. Food was waiting for her in her enclosure, which is surrounded by traps. And cameras were set up that may spot her. It isn’t the first time an animal has escaped from the zoo.  In 2013, Rusty  —   a red panda  —   got out using overhanging tree branches. He was later found in a tree in the Adams Morgan neighborhood and nudged from his perch with a long pole.  That same year, a nonflying vulture named Natalie used a wind gust to soar out of her enclosure. She was caught moments later in a nearby parking lot.  Justin Wm. Moyer contributed to this story.

"," An attorney for first lady Melania Trump argued in a lawsuit filed Monday that an article falsely alleging that she once worked for an escort service hurt her chance to establish “multimillion dollar business relationships” during the years in which she would be “one of the most photographed women in the world. ” The suit  —   filed Monday in New York Supreme Court, a state trial court, in Manhattan  —   against Mail Media, the owner of the Daily Mail, said the article published by the Daily Mail and its online division last August caused Trump’s brand, Melania, to lose “significant value” as well as “major business opportunities that were otherwise available to her. ” The suit said the article had damaged her “unique, once in a lifetime opportunity” to “launch a   commercial brand. ” “These product categories would have included, among other things, apparel accessories, shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care, skin care and fragrance,” according to the lawsuit, which was filed on Trump’s behalf by California attorney Charles Harder. Neither Harder nor the White House responded to requests for comment late Monday. Harder has represented several   clients, including wrestler Hulk Hogan, who won a $140 million invasion of privacy verdict against Gawker last year. The suit filed Monday did not spell out a plan by Trump to market her products during her tenure as first lady, but mentioned that her reputation had suffered just as she was experiencing a “  term” of elevated publicity. The suit says the Daily Mail article “impugned her fitness to perform her duties as First Lady of the United States. ” A similar suit had been filed against Mail Media and a local blogger in Maryland.  A Maryland judge recently dismissed the case against the Daily Mail on jurisdictional grounds. On Tuesday, the law firm representing the first lady said she had settled with the Gaithersburg blogger, Webster Tarpley, who agreed to apologize and pay her a “substantial sum,” said a statement from the law firm representing Melania Trump. The firm, Harder, Mirell & Abrams based in Beverly Hills, declined to provide the settlement amount.  [Melania Trump settles with Maryland blogger]  The article was eventually retracted with a statement from the Daily Mail that it didn’t “intend to state or suggest that Mrs. Trump ever worked as an ‘escort’ or in the sex business. ” The original article provided denials from Trump’s spokesman. But the lawsuit said significant emotional and economic damage was done and asks for compensatory and punitive damages of at least $150 million. Mail Media, in Maryland court filings, responded that the article was acceptable because it “discussed allegations that had been disseminated about the   first lady, and the impact even false rumors could have on the presidential race. ” The new suit comes as Trump continues to shy away from the spotlight, taking an unusually   approach thus far to her role as first lady. She has continued to live in New York, and has moved slowly to hire a White House staff.      (The Washington Post)   Richard Painter, a White House ethics counsel under President George W. Bush and a critic of President Trump’s decision to retain ownership of his real estate and branding empire while in office, said Monday that he was troubled by the suggestion in the new suit that Melania Trump intended to profit from her public role. “There has never been a first lady of the United States who insinuated that she intended to make a lot of money because of the ‘   ’ opportunity of being first lady,” said Painter, who is participating in a lawsuit claiming that President Trump’s relationship with his company violates a constitutional provision barring presidents from taking money or gifts from foreign  governments.

","  Tonight! We don’t think @realDonaldTrump is going to like this very much. #LSSC pic. twitter.   —   The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) February 11, 2017   Stephen Colbert tapped into the president’s reported sensitivity and tendency to care about appearances by showing a picture of a little girl  —   in bright pink dress, red tie and voluminous blond wig  —   pretending to be President Trump during Friday night’s “Late Show. ” The idea appears to have been inspired by the president’s distaste of the fact that his press secretary, Sean Spicer, was portrayed by a woman, Melissa McCarthy, on “Saturday Night Live. ” Citing sources close to Trump, Politico reported Monday that the president “doesn’t like his people to look weak,” and McCarthy’s portrayal of an angry, frustrated and unhinged Spicer was seen as something that could affect the press secretary’s longevity in the highly stressful and visible job.         So Colbert took things a step further. “But, if the president thinks a woman playing Sean Spicer makes him look weak, then he’s really not going to like this picture we made of a little girl pretending to be Donald Trump,” Colbert said. “And he’s especially not going to like it when you retweet at him with the hashtag #largerhands. ”   Before you go to sleep, remember, it’s your civic duty to make sure @realdonaldtrump knows that this little girl has #LargerHands. #LSSC pic. twitter.   —   The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) February 11, 2017     [Melissa McCarthy on SNL shows the power comedians have under a Trump presidency]   The hashtag was inspired by what’s been perceived as the president’s insecurity about the size of his hands. In 1988, satirical magazine Spy labeled Trump a “  vulgarian,” a criticism of one of the real estate mogul’s physical traits that bothered him for years. “He’ll send me pictures, tear sheets of magazines, and he did it as recently as (last April). With a gold Sharpie, he’ll circle his fingers and in his handwriting say, ‘See, not so short. ’” Graydon Carter, one of Spy magazine’s founders told NPR’s David Folkenflik last June. Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) whom Trump mocked by calling him “Little Marco,” turned the insults against the billionaire during a rally early last year. “You know what they say about men with small hands,” Rubio told a crowd in Salem, Va. in February 2016, when he was a presidential candidate. “You can’t trust ’em. ’” Trump seized on an opportunity to respond during a debate the following month. “[Rubio] referred to my hands, if they are small, something else must be small,” he said. “I guarantee you there is no problem. I guarantee. ”   [Are Donald Trump’s fingers weirdly short? An investigation.]   Conversations about Trump’s hands continued during a meeting with The Washington Post’s editorial board. He said he had “no choice” but to respond to Rubio’s insults and recounted feedback he was getting on the campaign trail. “I was on line shaking hands with supporters and one of the supporters said, ‘Mr. Trump, you have strong hands, you have good size hands.’ And then another one would say, ‘Oh, you have great hands, Mr. Trump. I had no idea,’” Trump said. Since Colbert’s show Friday night, countless Twitter users have followed his lead and tweeted mockeries of the president’s hands using the hashtag. Colbert also talked about Spicer’s gaffe earlier this week when he cited an Atlanta terrorist attack three times while defending Trump’s travel ban affecting seven predominantly Muslim countries. The press secretary cited such examples as the San Bernardino, Calif. and Boston attacks. Then he threw in Atlanta, a city where the only terrorist attack has been bombings orchestrated by a   domestic terrorist with no foreign ties, The Post’s Katie Mettler reported. The attacks happened in the 1990s. Spicer later gave an explanation to ABC News, saying he “clearly meant Orlando,” not Atlanta. On the “Late Show,” Colbert said, “I don’t remember any terrorist attacks in Atlanta, and neither did CNN. ” Shortly after McCarthy’s portrayal of Spicer, talks of casting women to portray members of the Trump administration on “Saturday Night Live” have swirled around the Internet. For instance, Rosie O’Donnell has come up as someone to play Stephen K. Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist and former Breitbart News chairman. O’Donnell tweeted an enthusiastic response and later changed her Twitter avatar to a picture of Bannon  —   with her face doctored in it.   available  —   if called i will serve ! !! https:  .   —   ROSIE (@Rosie) February 7, 2017   READ MORE: Melissa McCarthy was the perfect choice to play White House’s Sean Spicer on SNL Alec Baldwin returns as Trump on SNL, where an evil Bannon is actually president Trump isn’t the first president ‘Saturday Night Live’ has skewered.

","     White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday would not confirm that President Trump has confidence in his national security adviser Michael Flynn, and said that the president is still “evaluating the situation. ” In a statement, Spicer contradicted the comments made by another senior aide, Kellyanne Conway, who just hours earlier had said that the president remained confident in Flynn. The mixed signals come amid growing concerns about whether Flynn communicated with Russian officials about sanctions before Trump took office and caused Vice President Pence to mislead the public about those conversations.      National security adviser Michael Flynn allegedly spoke to Russia’s ambassador about sanctions during the presidential transition in December 2016. The Post’s Adam Entous explains why those phone calls are so interesting and how the Trump administration has responded to them. (Bastien   Washington Post)   “He’s speaking to Vice President Pence relative to the conversation the Vice President had with Gen. Flynn and also speaking to various other people about what he considers the single most important subject there is: our national security,” Spicer said. Earlier in the day, Conway, the counselor to the president, said that Flynn “does enjoy the full confidence of the president, in an appearance on MSNBC on Monday. Conway’s comments come a day after another White House official, Stephen Miller, declined to say whether the retired general still had Trump’s confidence. “It’s not for me to tell you what’s in the president’s mind,” Miller said on NBC News’s “Meet the Press. ” The Washington Post reported last week that Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak discussed U. S. sanctions against Russia in conversations before Trump took office.   [National security adviser Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador, despite denials, officials say]   Pence appeared on national television in January backing up Flynn’s claim that his conversations did not touch on the sanctions. But in recent days, Flynn has acknowledged that he may have communicated with the ambassador about sanctions during the transition, despite the White House’s denials. Conway said Flynn and Pence spoke twice Friday after the Post story was published, one time by phone and the other in person. She would not say whether Flynn apologized to the vice president. Flynn spent the weekend at the president’s    home in Florida with Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Seeking to dispel rumors that Flynn’s ouster could be imminent, Conway emphasized that he remained a key part of the president staff. There are “a lot of significant things happening with our commander in chief, and obviously General Flynn is a part of all of those,” Conway said."

136934,206526,What does a black hole look like? Astronomers are on a quest to find out.,Washington Post,Sarah Kaplan,2017-04-05,2017.0,4.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170406005807/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/04/05/astronomers-are-trying-to-take-the-first-picture-of-a-black-hole/
","     By its very nature, the black hole at the heart of our galaxy is impossible to spot. Its overwhelming gravity allows nothing to escape, not even light. Massive enough to send shivers through   itself, yet perfectly invisible, it lurks in the darkness like a monster from a child’s nightmare  —   felt but unseen. It is the stuff of physicists’ wildest dreams. “Black holes are basically the most mysterious objects in the cosmos,” said Shep Doeleman, an astronomer at the   Center for Astrophysics. Even Albert Einstein almost didn’t believe they were real, even though it was his theory of general relativity that helped predict them more than 100 years ago. In the century since, scientists have been able to sense black holes through observations of their influence on nearby matter. And with last year’s detection of gravitational waves emitted by two colliding black holes, they’ve also heard them. But no one has ever seen a black hole. The enigmatic objects hide behind an “event horizon”  —   the boundary at which gravity acts like an invisibility cloak, wrapping around light and matter and swallowing them whole. No telescope on Earth is powerful enough to penetrate that abyss. At least, no single telescope is. On Wednesday night, a battalion of 120 astronomers working at eight observatories on four continents will mobilize in an unprecedented effort to image the black hole at the center of the Milky Way, a body named Sagittarius A*. By combining observations from points across the globe, they’ll create a virtual observatory the size of Earth itself. The “Event Horizon Telescope,” they call it.      This artist’s impression shows a glowing stream of material from a star as it is devoured by a supermassive black hole. (  )  If all goes according to plan, the EHT should capture the dark silhouette of Sagittarius A* against the hot, glowing material that surrounds it, offering the   glimpse at a black hole’s event horizon. The resulting snapshot could confirm our understanding of the laws of the universe  —   or upend it. “It’s a very bold and gutsy experiment,” Stanford University theoretical astrophysicist Roger Blandford, who is not involved in the project, told Science last month. “It will validate this remarkable proposition: that black holes are common in the universe. Seeing is believing. ” Sagittarius A* like other supermassive black holes, was probably formed during the earliest days of the universe. It is about 4 million times as hefty as the sun but only 18 times as large, and it sits on   like a bowling ball on a trampoline, warping everything around it. Under these extreme conditions, the laws of physics are pushed to their limits: Gravity is twisted; light is torn apart like taffy; matter is made to vanish from existence. Doeleman, the EHT’s director, calls black holes “the most exotic animals in the cosmological zoo. ” Studying what they eat and how they behave can teach scientists a great deal about the workings of the universe, he said.   [This black hole is being pushed around its galaxy by gravitational waves]   But feeding time is a messy affair. As Sagittarius A* slurps up matter from the boiling buffet of gas, dust and bits of stars swirling around it, it flings huge amounts of material back into space:   radio waves, jets of ultrahot gas. Paradoxically, all this activity makes the black hole one of the brightest things in the Milky Way  —   and further obscures the darkness inside.    An   flare at Sagittarius A*. (D. Haggard et al.    College)  If Doeleman and his colleagues want to get a glimpse of the event horizon itself, they can’t study the black hole in visible light wavelengths since those are lost in the chaos of the accretion disk. Instead, they must examine it using high frequency radio waves, which can penetrate the wall of glowing gas, traverse 26, 000   of the interstellar medium, pass through Earth’s atmosphere and be detected by telescopes on the ground. But no radio telescope on Earth is large enough to take a   image of an object that far away. Though Sagittarius A* is big  —   and its distortion of gravity makes it appear even bigger (an effect called “lensing”)  —   it would still appear to Earthlings as an orange on the moon. Since an instrument’s magnifying power is equal to the size of its collecting dish, scientists would need a telescope the size of Earth to make such a dark, distant object visible.   [Are black holes really all that black? A new study supports Stephen Hawking’s theory.]   With little chance of the world’s governments banding together to build an   telescope, Doeleman and his colleagues are using a technique called    interferometry, or VLBI. “Basically, that’s a word salad for linking radio dishes around the globe to act as one large telescope,” he said.    The Atacama Large   Array (ALMA) in Chile, one of the eight observatories that constitute the Event Horizon Telescope. (C.  )  Over five nights during a   window beginning Wednesday, the eight telescopes of the EHT will swivel as one toward the center of the galaxy. Scientists in Chile’s Atacama Desert, on a volcano top in Hawaii, at the frozen expanse of the South Pole and in the high, dry mountains of Arizona, Mexico and Spain will be ready to catch the data. If conditions are exactly right at each location  —   skies clear, instruments working  —   then Doeleman will give the signal to start observing. In addition to Sagittarius A* the EHT will target a second, even more massive black hole in neighboring galaxy M87. Once they get their five nights of observations, the astronomers around the globe will deliver their findings to supercomputers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Max Planck Institute in Germany. Doeleman expects to have two to three petabytes of data to look through  —   equivalent to the storage capacity of about 10, 000 MacBooks. It will take the researchers months, if not years, to analyze all the findings. “VLBI is the ultimate in delayed gratification,” Doeleman said. “You can’t even know if your system is working properly until weeks and months after, when you combine the signals from all the different telescopes. ”    The black hole Sagittarius A* appears as a large bright spot in the orange cloud of dust at the center of the Milky Way. (D. Haggard et al. (   College)  Team members hope to get their first glimpse of real science this fall, and they have no idea what they might see. If predictions based on modern physics are correct, Sagittarius A* should appear as a bright ring of light (from   photons orbiting the black hole) with a dim interior. But if scientists are wrong about the way the universe works, this is where they’ll find out. “It’s the most exciting proving ground, the most stringent test of Einstein’s theories,” Doeleman said. “The best result is we learn something very interesting, and it poses the next set of questions. ” Read more: Are the world’s most stunning shells too beautiful for their own good?

137405,207120,Trump is now talking about consolidating his power,Washington Post,Aaron Blake,2017-04-29,2017.0,4.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170430002542/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/29/trump-is-now-talking-about-consolidating-his-own-power/
","   President Trump has suggested that the judiciary doesn’t have the authority to question him. He was a very early proponent of nuking the filibuster for Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. And he recently raised eyebrows by congratulating Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the expansion of his presidential powers  —   echoing his previous admiration for strongman leaders. Now Trump is talking about consolidating his own power. In an interview with Fox News that aired Friday night, Trump dismissed the “archaic” rules of the House and Senate  —   using that word four times  —   and suggested they needed to be streamlined for the good of the country. A sampling:  “We don’t have a lot of closers in politics, and I understand why: It’s a very rough system. It’s an archaic system. ” “You look at the rules of the Senate, even the rules of the House  —   but the rules of the Senate and some of the things you have to go through  —   it’s really a bad thing for the country, in my opinion. They’re archaic rules. And maybe at some point we’re going to have to take those rules on, because, for the good of the nation, things are going to have to be different. ” “You can’t go through a process like this. It’s not fair. It forces you to make bad decisions. I mean, you’re really forced into doing things that you would normally not do except for these archaic rules. ”  And then Trump came out and just said it: He doesn’t like the filibuster. “I think, you know, the filibuster concept is not a good concept to start off with,” he said. So there you go. Trump is frustrated with the pace of legislation after 100 days, and his answer is that he wants to change the rules. Whether this is just him blowing off steam or signaling what lies ahead, it’s significant. Because it suggests a president, yet again, who doesn’t agree with his own powers being limited or even questioned. Remember when senior policy adviser Stephen Miller declared “the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned?” This is more of that kind of attitude. He wants more power  —   and he wants it quickly. It’s not difficult to connect this to his past admiration for authoritarian leaders, and these comments are likely to give Democrats (and even some in the GOP establishment) plenty of heartburn. This is a demonstrated pattern for him, for all the reasons listed at the top of this post. We’re a far cry from the presidential candidate who decried President Obama’s executive orders, suggesting they were an indication of a weak leader who couldn’t bend Congress to his will. Trump is now admitting that he can’t bend Congress to his will, but he blames the system rather than himself. Who knew governing was so tough, right? And it’s difficult to overstate how significant it would be if he actually went after the filibuster. The   threshold for passing legislation in the Senate  —   which still exists for everything except presidential nominations  —   is the last vestige of Democratic power in Washington and really the only thing standing in the way of the majority party doing whatever it wants. Getting rid of it completely would change the face of American politics for good and clear a major hurdle for Trump in passing his agenda. He’d still have to get Republicans to unite behind his priorities, which hasn’t proven easy. His   push, for example, isn’t stalled because of the   threshold in the Senate. It’s actually not even subject to it; his problem is getting House Republicans to agree. Whether he targets the filibuster specifically or not, his attitude toward his own power is clear: The more, the better. He’s already gotten a taste for rolling back the filibuster, and after just 100 days of frustration, he already wants more.          "

","  ISTANBUL  —   Russia, Iran and Turkey said Thursday that they have agreed to create “  zones” across four areas in Syria, renewing diplomatic  efforts to bring warring parties in the country to heel after six years of fighting.  Meeting in the Kazakh capital, Astana, the three powers said the   deal would come into force Saturday and would apply to both government and rebel forces in the designated areas, where the Islamic State does not hold large swaths of territory. The agreement, signed by all three guarantor countries, said that the zones would be demarcated by checkpoints on the ground and that “unarmed  civilians” would be able to move freely between   and    territory. Checkpoints would be overseen by the three guarantors but could, “if necessary,” be manned by unspecified “third parties,” it said. But it was unclear how the deal differed from several previous failed   in which the Syrian air force continued to bomb   areas. The agreement said “the parties agreed to take all necessary measures to continue the fight” against designated terrorist groups “within and outside” the zones.  [Putin pushes Syrian safe zone proposals in talks with Turkish leader]    A hospital was badly damaged in an airstrike in Eastern Ghouta on May 1. (Sameer      via Getty Images)  Although Russia and Iran exert influence over Syrian President Bashar   and Turkey is an important backer of the rebels, there were few early signs that either side was committed to the deal.  In Astana, where the three international powers are overseeing peace talks, the announcement caused a ruckus in the rebel delegation, with one top commander shouting, “See you on the battlefield!” The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain, also said that the Syrian air force stepped up strikes in the proposed   zones after their locations were revealed in a Russian draft proposal Wednesday.  The State Department, noting that it was “not a direct participant” in the talks, although it sent an official to observe, said it supported “any effort that can genuinely   the violence in Syria,” ensure humanitarian aid and promote a political resolution to the conflict.  But the statement, by spokeswoman Heather Nauert, said that “we continue to have concerns” about the agreement, “including the involvement of Iran as a   ‘guarantor.’ ” It added: “Iran’s activities in Syria have only contributed to the violence, not stopped it, and Iran’s unquestioning support for the Assad regime has perpetuated the misery of ordinary Syrians. ”  The   agreement excludes attacks on  ’s  Syrian affiliate  —   the group known formerly as Jabhat   and now as Jabhat Fatah    —   and the Islamic State. In earlier truces agreed to between the Obama administration and Russia, that exclusion led both Russia and Syria to continue bombing rebel and civilian areas, arguing that they were targeting “terrorists. ” “In light of the failures of past agreements,” Nauert’s statement said, “we have reason to be cautious. We expect the regime to stop all attacks on civilians and opposition forces, something they have never done. We expect Russia to ensure regime compliance. ” The White House said this week that President Trump and Russian President Vladi mir Putin discussed “safe, or   zones” in a Tuesday phone call. But the Trump administration has not specified publicly what it is willing to support or how.  [Trump and Putin discuss   in Syria in first conversation since U. S. airstrikes]  At least half a million people are estimated to have been killed in Syria’s war, and half its population displaced. According to the Kazakhstan agreement, the proposed safe zones will cover four areas: the northern province of Idlib, where almost a million displaced people are packed among rebel forces dominated by   and some portions of adjoining provinces; Eastern Ghouta, a besieged area on the outskirts of Damascus that is the last remaining threat to Assad’s hold on the capital; a besieged district of the   city of Homs, 100 miles north of Damascus; and a swath of Syria’s southern border with Jordan where the United States is supporting rebel forces against Islamic State militants. Except for the stated exceptions for “terrorists,” it said that “hostilities between” Assad’s forces and those rebel groups that sign on, “with the use of any kinds of weapons, including aerial assets, shall be ceased. ” Maps of the delineated   areas are expected to be agreed to by June 4, along with plans to deliver humanitarian aid and ensure the safe return of civilians who fled. The United Nations’ Syria envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hailed the announcement as a “step in the right direction” toward a broader truce. But experts suggested its guarantors might be using its provisions to secure their own interests in Syria.  “Russia opposed   zones at the time when it was still busy, along with Iran, assisting Assad’s forces in, first, stabilizing the front and then rolling back the gains made by the opposition forces,” said Simon Saradzhyan, the founding director of the Russia Matters Project at Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. With the rebels all but defeated, Saradzhyan argued, Russia is now ready to support a diplomatic solution with international backing.  Turkey has also backed safe zones in the past, albeit in different areas along its southern border with Syria, viewing them as a way to block Kurdish ambitions in that region.   While Washington is backing the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) as an essential partner in the fight to defeat the Islamic State in Syria, Turkey is locked in battle with the group’s Turkish affiliate, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) which the United States also lists as a terrorist organization.  The U. S.  alliance has been a major thorn in the side of the U. S. relationship with Turkey and is likely to be a central agenda item when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visits Trump in Washington on May 16. “Every side in this fight wants something,” said one rebel official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly. “The foreign powers aren’t doing this for altruism. ”  DeYoung reported from Washington.

137732,207535,Lawmakers express shock and concern about Trump disclosure of classified information,Washington Post,Elise Viebeck,2017-05-15,2017.0,5.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170516002756/https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/lawmakers-express-shock-and-concern-about-trump-disclosure-of-classified-information/2017/05/15/d0d6f8be-39b5-11e7-a058-ddbb23c75d82_story.html
"," Lawmakers expressed shock and concern after learning that President Trump had revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador during a meeting in the Oval Office last week, according to current and former U. S. officials. “Obviously, they are in a downward spiral right now and have got to figure out a way to come to grips with all that’s happening,” Sen. Bob Corker ( .) chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said of the Trump administration. “The chaos that is being created by the lack of discipline is creating an environment that I think makes  —   it creates a worrisome environment,” he said.   [Trump revealed highly classified information to Russian foreign minister and ambassador]  Trump’s disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State, according to the officials. The information Trump relayed, officials said, had been provided by a U. S. partner through an   arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U. S. government.       (Bastien   Washington Post)   The news created a sensation as it spread through Washington and up to Capitol Hill Monday, where senators were returning for evening votes.  “If the report is true, it is very disturbing,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( . Y.) said in a statement. “Revealing classified information at this level is extremely dangerous and puts at risk the lives of Americans and those who gather intelligence for our country. The President owes the intelligence community, the American people, and Congress a full explanation. ”  A spokesman for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) emphasized the importance of safeguarding sensitive intelligence.  “We have no way to know what was said, but protecting our nation’s secrets is paramount. The speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration,” Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said in a statement.  The revelation came at a sensitive time for the president, who less than a week ago cited “this Russia thing with Trump” in explaining why he fired FBI Director James B. Comey, who was leading an investigation into Russia’s interference with the 2016 election. Investigators are already probing possible coordination between Trump’s campaign and the Russian government, and the president has struggled to shake the issue as he tries to advance his legislative agenda.  The news is likely to raise questions on Capitol Hill about Trump’s handling of classified information. It could also increase pressure on investigators looking into Trump’s possible ties to the Kremlin.  And it could pull attention away from Republicans’ policy priorities this week. The Senate GOP is working to hammer out the details of a   plan, and the House is returning from a   break.  The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee called the news a “slap in the face to the intel community. ”  “Risking sources and methods is inexcusable, particularly with the Russians,” Sen. Mark R. Warner ( .) tweeted around 6 p. m.  Sen. Ron Wyden ( .) a member of the panel, said the report was of the “gravest possible concern. ”  “This kind of disclosure could harm national security by jeopardizing important sources of information needed to disrupt terrorist attacks,” Wyden said in a statement.  As senators gathered for their first vote of the week, Republicans and Democrats said they were worried about the developing story. The House was not in session Monday evening.  “Pretty terrifying,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal ( . ). “If true, it is astonishing, appalling and should be investigated. It was astonishing and absolutely surprising. I would never have imagined the chief executive of our great nation would undertake that kind of disclosure. ” Sen. John Thune (S. D.) chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, said, “I would be concerned anytime we’re discussing sensitive subjects with the Russians. ” Thune reacted after an initial briefing on the news report and said he had not reviewed details.  Sen. Joe Manchin III ( . Va.) a member of the Intelligence Committee, said he’d only heard the basics of the report but called them “very serious. ” He noted that fewer than 25 senators are ever given access to the nation’s most sensitive secrets and he learns things he “can’t even talk about with other senators. ” If the reports are true, “it’s very damning, very damaging,” Manchin said, adding that such disclosures “would be extremely dangerous and concerning to all. ” Sen. Christopher A. Coons ( .) said had he just read The Post story and, “if true, that would be genuinely shocking. ”  “It’s disturbing if true,” Sen. Angus King ( ) said.  Several senators said they did not know the details of The Post report but called the news troubling nonetheless.  “This is not the appropriate move on his part, and I just think it’s part of a pattern of recklessness that we’ve got to get a handle on,” said Sen. Martin Heinrich ( . M.).  Sen. John McCain ( .) chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said, “We certainly don’t want any president to leak classified information, but the president does have the right to do that. . . . I think any president needs to be careful. ”      About a dozen reporters continued to stake out a bipartisan   meeting around 7 p. m. intent on asking questions about Trump. The scene was reminiscent of the prior week, when Capitol Hill was consumed by news of Comey’s firing.        McCain, clearly flustered by reporters pressing for answers, walked off the Senate floor and said he hadn’t read the reports, adding, “I can’t comment on every breaking news story. ” Later, he commented: “That’s why it’s classified. They have a reason to classify it, okay? And when they say it’s classified, if it was public knowledge, then it could hurt the national security of the United States. That’s why we classify. ” McCain said the news would be “disturbing” if true.   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( .) was silent as he walked from his office to the Senate floor. Asked how concerned he was about Trump sharing information with Russian officials, he looked straight ahead, offering no reaction.  Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.) the Republican whip and a candidate to replace Comey as FBI director, said he didn’t have “any information about that at all. ”  “I’m just not going to answer a hypothetical question,” he told reporters.

137921,207757,CIA director alerted FBI to pattern of contacts between Russian officials and Trump campaign associates,Washington Post,Greg Miller,2017-05-23,2017.0,5.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170524001342/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-director-warned-russian-security-service-chief-about-interference-in-election/2017/05/23/ebff2a7e-3fbb-11e7-adba-394ee67a7582_story.html
"," The CIA alerted the FBI to a troubling pattern of contacts between Russian officials and associates of the Trump campaign last year, former agency director John Brennan testified on Tuesday, shedding new light on the origin of a criminal probe that now reaches into the White House. In testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, Brennan said he became increasingly concerned that Trump associates were being manipulated by Russian intelligence services as part of a broader covert influence campaign that sought to disrupt the election and deliver the presidency to Trump. “I was worried by a number of the contacts that the Russians had with U. S. persons,” Brennan said, adding that he did not see proof of collusion before he left office on Jan. 20, but “felt as though the FBI investigation was certainly   and needed to look into those issues. ” Brennan’s remarks represent the most detailed public accounting to date of his tenure as CIA director during the alleged Russian assault on the U. S. presidential race, and the agency’s role in triggering an FBI probe that Trump has sought to contain.  [Trump asked intelligence chiefs to push back against FBI collusion probe after Comey revealed its existence]      Team Trump’s ties to Russian interests View Graphic     Team Trump’s ties to Russian interests  “It should be clear to everyone that Russia brazenly interfered in our 2016 presidential election process,” Brennan said at one point, one of several moments in which his words seemed aimed squarely at the president. Trump has refused to fully accept the unanimous conclusion of U. S. intelligence agencies that Russia stole thousands of sensitive emails, orchestrated online dumps of damaging information and employed fake news and other means to upend the 2016 race. GOP lawmakers spent much of Tuesday’s hearing trying to get Brennan to concede that he had no conclusive evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Brennan acknowledged that he still had “unresolved questions” about the purpose of those contacts when he stepped down as CIA director in January. But, “I know what the Russians try to do,” Brennan said. “They try to suborn individuals and they try to get individuals, including U. S. persons, to act on their behalf either wittingly or unwittingly. ” Brennan refused to name any of the U. S. individuals who were apparently detected communicating with Russian officials. The FBI investigation, which began last July, has scrutinized Trump associates including Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager; Carter Page, who was once listed as a foreign policy adviser to Trump; and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was forced to resign after misleading statements about his contacts with the Russian ambassador were exposed. The probe has intensified in recent weeks and identified a current White House official as a significant person of interest. Because Russia uses intermediaries and other measures to disguise its hand, “many times, [U. S. individuals] do not know that the individual they are interacting with is a Russian,” Brennan said.       (Whitney   Washington Post)   He added that Russian agencies routinely seek to gather compromising information, or ”kompromat,” to coerce treason from U. S. officials who “do not even realize they are on that path until it gets too late. ” The remark appeared to be in reference to Flynn.   The Senate Intelligence Committee is issuing two new subpoenas for information from Flynn’s companies and challenging his lawyer’s refusal to comply with an existing subpoena for documents detailing his contacts with Russian officials, committee leaders announced Tuesday. “A business does not have the right to take the Fifth,” Sen. Mark R. Warner ( .) the committee’s lead Democrat, told reporters as he and chairman Richard Burr ( . C.) pledged to “keep all options on the table. ” Brennan was also asked about Trump’s disclosure of highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in a White House meeting this month. Brennan said that the CIA at times provided tips about terrorist plots to the Kremlin, but he indicated that Trump violated key protocols. Sensitive information should only be passed through intelligence services, not divulged to foreign ministers or ambassadors, Brennan said. Referring to the information revealed by Trump, Brennan said it had neither gone through “the proper channels nor did the originating agency have the opportunity to clear language for it. ” Brennan was a key figure in the Obama administration’s handling of Russian election interference. As alarm grew, Brennan held classified meetings with top congressional officials in the fall to impress upon them the unprecedented nature of Moscow’s interference. Later, Brennan was among the top officials who briefed    Trump on the scale of Russia’s intervention, and its assessed goal of helping Trump win.  [FBI in agreement with CIA that Russia aimed to help Trump win White House]  On Tuesday, Brennan testified that he was the first to confront a senior member of the Russian government on the matter, using an August phone conversation with the head of Russia’s security service, the FSB, to warn that the meddling would backfire and damage the country’s relationship with the United States. Brennan said he told FSB chief Alexander Bortnikov that “American voters would be outraged by any Russian attempt to interfere in the election” and that such activity “would destroy any   prospect of improvement” in relations with the United States. Bortnikov twice denied that Russia was waging such a campaign, according to Brennan, but said he would carry the message to Russian President Vladi mir Putin.  [Political chaos in Washington is a return on investment for Moscow]  “I believe I was the first U. S. official to brace Russia on this matter,” Brennan said. The Obama administration went on to issue statements publicly accusing Moscow of election meddling, and in December announced punitive measures including the expulsion of 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives from the United States. Despite those warnings and efforts at retaliation, Brennan said that Russia was probably not dissuaded from attempting similar interference operations in the future. The former CIA chief is the latest senior Obama administration official to appear publicly before Congress in hearings that have often produced damaging headlines for Trump. Earlier this month, former acting attorney general Sally Yates testified that she expected White House officials to “take action” after warning that Flynn had misled administration officials about his contacts with Russia. At that same hearing, former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. said that Moscow’s leaders “must be congratulating themselves for having exceeded their wildest expectations with a minimal expenditure of resource,” a reference not only to the outcome of the 2016 race but also to the chaos that has characterized the early months of the Trump administration. Brennan has feuded publicly with Trump over the president’s treatment of intelligence agencies. In January, he lashed out at Trump for comparing U. S. spy agencies with Nazi secret police. Brennan was particularly offended by Trump’s remarks during a speech at CIA headquarters on the day after he was inaugurated. Trump used the CIA’s Memorial Wall  —   a collection of engraved stars marking the lives of agency operatives killed in the line of duty  —   to launch a rambling speech in which he bragged about his election victory. Brennan called the appearance “despicable” and said that Trump should be “ashamed. ”  Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report.

","     The girls, ages 1 and 2, were gravely ill when they arrived at the hospital. According to investigators, their mother made it sound like they’d collapsed mysteriously on an otherwise idyllic day. “There’s a lake close to where they were,” Kerr County Sheriff Rusty Hierholzer told The Washington Post. “She said the little girls were walking around smelling flowers. She didn’t know if maybe they’d ingested or touched a poisonous flower. ” That was a lie, Hierholzer said. The sisters’ final day of consciousness had not been spent among flowers, he said, but rather intentionally trapped inside an SUV that grew hotter by the hour in “the most horrific case of child endangerment that I have seen in the 37 years that I have been in law enforcement. ” It is, sadly, not so rare for children to be left alone in hot cars as the sun bakes them alive. Law enforcement and first responders see multiple cases each year. But “most of them are accidents,” Hierholzer said. “She knew those kids were back there. She left them in that car,” he said. Amanda Hawkins, 19, had not taken her daughters to a park as she first claimed, authorities say, but rather to a friend’s house on Tuesday night, where she got out of the vehicle and left her children alone until noon the next day. “About 15 to 18 hours,” Hierholzer said. “Windows rolled up. Ninety degree weather. ”   [Fatal Distraction: Forgetting a Child in the Backseat of a Car Is a Horrifying Mistake. Is It a Crime?]   The sheriff didn’t say exactly what Hawkins and her friends were doing in the house. But some time Tuesday evening, he said, someone heard the girls crying outside and asked Hawkins to bring them in. “She said: ‘No, it’s fine. They’ll cry themselves to sleep,’” Hierholzer said. The mother had arrived to the house with a teenage friend, who early in the morning went to sleep in the car with the children, according to the sheriff. But “he went back inside,” the sheriff said. The children remained in the car as the sun rose over the Hill Country county northwest of San Antonio. Their names were Brynn Hawkins, 1, and Addyson    —   a    who loved to help adults by fetching items for them, a friend of the mother told KSAT. The mother finally returned to the SUV about noon on Wednesday, Hierholzer said. “Best we can tell, they were probably unresponsive. ” They were alive, still. But instead of seeking help immediately, authorities say, the mother bathed and   her children  —   attempting to cover up what happened until their conditions left no option but the hospital and a lie about flowers. “It unraveled pretty quickly,” the sheriff told Fox 29. He said Hawkins has since confessed. It was unclear if she has an attorney. Late Thursday afternoon, hospital staff in San Antonio unplugged Brynn and Addyson’s ventilators, having concluded that they were beyond saving. Hawkins, who could not be reached, was jailed on two counts of abandoning or endangering a child  —   one for each daughter  —   and could face more charges after the police find out more about their last hours.

138435,208391,How the NRA conquered Washington and abandoned gun owners like me,Washington Post,Matt Valentine,2017-06-16,2017.0,6.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170618000005/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/how-the-nra-conquered-washington-and-abandoned-gun-owners-like-me/2017/06/16/e9374238-51e8-11e7-91eb-9611861a988f_story.html
"," In the winter of 2008, shortly after the election of Barack Obama, my fiancee and I stopped into a local gun shop in Austin to buy ammunition for target practice, a hobby we enjoyed once or twice a month. Though we hadn’t asked, the clerk behind the counter told us that all the   and   rifles were  . We could get on the waitlist, he offered, but the delay might be a couple of months  —   “if it’s still even legal to buy one then. ”   Eight years later, gun rights in America appear not only to have survived the Obama administration but to have thrived. Gun sales broke records almost every year of the past eight. As president, Obama signed legislation allowing guns onto Amtrak trains and into national parks, where they were previously prohibited, and his executive orders after the Sandy Hook massacre had no perceptible effect on most gun owners. Then we elected Donald Trump  —   a   candidate who earned an endorsement from the National Rifle Association before he had even consolidated the support of his own political party. In April, Trump became the first sitting U. S. president since Ronald Reagan to address the NRA’s annual meeting. He told the cheering crowd that he was their “true friend and champion in the White House” and proclaimed that “the   assault on your Second Amendment freedoms” was over.   Perhaps the NRA shouldn’t have cheered. For years, the gun lobby has built its narrative around the idea that powerful forces in government are conspiring to ban and confiscate privately owned guns. That premise drove gun owners to   stores as well as to the polls. Trump’s election, coinciding with conservative majorities in both houses of Congress and on the Supreme Court, has tanked gun sales and undermined the NRA’s most effective messaging. And with several Republican congressmen targeted this past week in a shooting in suburban Washington  the familiar political rhetoric about guns now seems dissonant.  When the NRA sells   depicting a   eagle above the slogan “Because you can’t fist fight tyranny,” the implication is that you can fight tyranny (however you perceive it) with guns. It should be no surprise that someone would shoot democratically elected representatives when we’ve been told for decades that that’s the patriotic redress to political grievances. How will the NRA’s   message resonate in the absence of a   bogeyman, and when its own   politicians are targeted by gun violence? And who will represent gun owners’ actual interests while the NRA chases an antagonistic strategy that now seems entirely played out?    The idea that the NRA speaks with one voice for America’s 100 million gun owners has never really been credible. The organization claims to have 5 million members, a figure that can’t be independently verified and that doesn’t jibe with its magazine circulation. That tally also includes people like me: intermittent NRA members who joined as a prerequisite for something else. (Local gun clubs, certain insurance policies and even some employers require NRA membership or subsidize it as a benefit.) In any case, the political agenda of the organization doesn’t necessarily reflect the will of    members. Of the 76 directors who lead the NRA,    members elect only one. A small committee nominates candidates to fill the other 75 positions, for which only lifetime members may cast votes.  Still, there’s no denying the NRA’s huge political influence over the past few decades. Its Political Victory Fund scores candidates at every level of government, and an endorsement can be extremely valuable  —   in the 2016 election cycle, the NRA dumped millions of dollars into key races. By flexing its political muscle, the NRA has blocked funding for federal gun violence research, stalled presidential appointments and killed every significant piece of   legislation introduced in Congress since the Federal assault weapons ban of 1994.   Having won battles against universal background checks and a federal assault weapons ban, the group has moved on to champion   causes. Here in Texas, affiliates of the NRA have voiced support for the right to carry guns in college classrooms, courthouses, mental hospitals and zoos  and the right to carry a gun with no license or training whatsoever.   But who really wants this stuff? In August 2016, a young man identified himself to the New York Times as the only remaining member of Students for Campus Carry at the University of Texas at Austin (where about 50, 000 undergraduates are enrolled). I’ve observed half a dozen   demonstrations in the vicinity of the Texas State Capitol  —   the clusters of men with semiautomatic rifles slung across their chests are conspicuous but not numerous. A 2015 University of   Tribune poll found that only 32 percent of Texans wanted looser gun laws; a 2016 poll in Utah found that only 24 percent of Utahns supported legalizing permitless carrying. These are policies in search of a constituency.   Legislators in   Texas, Louisiana and South Carolina were still considering   legislation this spring, after similar bills failed in New Mexico, Virginia, Utah and South Dakota. The bills were widely unpopular and were vocally opposed by law enforcement, but had the support of   state organizations. Gun violence prevention advocates in Texas and Louisiana told me that, behind closed doors, Republican legislators encouraged them to keep up the fight, in the hopes that public pressure would ease these bills to an early death in committee. That’s exactly what happened. (Supporters of permitless carry in Texas have hopes that the legislation could get another chance during this summer’s special session, but Governor Abbott didn’t include it on his   agenda.)  That the policies are unpopular and incite protest can be spun as a plus for the NRA in the   era. You won’t find anybody spontaneously marching in the streets in favor of gun confiscation or a broad ban on civilian gun sales. If the NRA wants to produce evidence of “ ” activism, it needs to provoke it. Suggest guns in dormitories or guns in bars or a bill to allow domestic abusers to keep their guns, and of course somebody will show up wearing a sandwich board or swinging a dildo in protest.  Meanwhile, many new gun owners seem content (or compelled) to stand apart from the NRA and establish their own organizations. These include the National African American Gun Association; the Pink Pistols, an LGBT gun group; Trigger Happy Firearm Instruction, described by its founder as “a movement” for African American women; and the Black Women’s Defense League . Some of these growing groups (such as the Liberal Gun Club) have articulated specific policy positions, but most have very broad vision statements about inclusion or empowerment.  Faced with an evolving political climate, the NRA appears now to be doubling down on strategic antagonism. Casting about for a new enemy to replace Obama, the group recently turned its attention to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) which it compares to   . While the NRA focuses on PETA, perhaps one of these emerging groups can take up issues more relevant to many gun owners.   Almost every gun owner will tell you that they prioritize safety. They’re usually talking about their own practices in the way they handle guns. And to their credit, most   organizations I’ve encountered, including the NRA, offer information or training on the safe handling of firearms to prevent accidents. But what about consumer safety? The NRA has fought efforts to regulate gun and ammunition manufacturing, or to grant any federal agency the authority to mandate a safety recall for firearms. In some instances, gunmakers have known for years about defects in their products that have caused injuries and death, but have delayed issuing a recall. Nearly every other industry in the United States is subject to regulatory oversight for product safety, and the firearm industry should be no different. But when legislators express support for emerging technology that could make guns safer, the NRA labels them “ . ” Another meaningful initiative that a membership organization for gun owners could pursue is suicide prevention. In 2014, I wrote about a small campaign organized by gun enthusiasts and suicide prevention experts in New Hampshire. Part of the idea was that gun owners should, as a matter of course, temporarily take firearms away from friends or relatives experiencing emotional distress (during a divorce or a job loss, for example). The idea is no more offensive than the notion of taking away a friend’s car keys when he’s had too much to drink. One has to wonder why the NRA, an organization that emphasizes safety, hasn’t embraced efforts like this one. The NRA has recently exhibited a little interest in suicide prevention, though it isn’t an issue they emphasize. When NRA spokespeople do address suicide, it’s usually to dismiss the demonstrable fact that easy access to guns is a risk factor. A third useful role for a socially responsible gun club could be to work with government to help keep guns out of the wrong hands. It might sound preposterous today to suggest that a firearms enthusiast group might support strict recordkeeping on gun sales or a waiting period for purchases, or might help the government write legislation to restrict civilian access to battlefield weapons. But it has happened before, in the 1920s and ’30s . The group was called the National Rifle Association.

"," When Iranian voters rallied behind Hassan Rouhani in 2013 as their surprise choice for president, they picked a reformer who promised to end the crushing pain of international sanctions. On Saturday, Rouhani delivered, securing the   economic relief that Iran craved and the country’s enemies desperately opposed. Yet, it is still unclear whether Rouhani’s windfall  —   up to $50 billion in unfrozen assets and freedom from severe trade restrictions  —   will be enough to secure a future for his presidency and the more moderate, pragmatic Iran he is seeking to build. Western powers formally approved the removal of the most onerous economic sanctions after Iran honored promises to significantly curtail key parts of its nuclear program as part of a deal reached in July, voluntarily disabling a reactor and other equipment that the U. S. and Israeli governments had previously threatened to destroy with bombs. Implicit in the agreement is an opportunity for Iran to rebuild its battered economy and end decades of diplomatic isolation, even as the country submits to unprecedented monitoring to guard against cheating on the nuclear deal. But economists and Iran experts say it could be months or longer before ordinary Iranians feel any benefit from sanctions relief, a delay that could undermine Rouhani’s popularity and weaken his grip on power. Until then, the Iranian president will have to battle   within his government who will be anxious to use the cash reserves for their own purposes. The country’s economy will also continue to struggle against a ferocious headwind of plummeting oil prices, which could cancel out many of the gains Rouhani achieved through negotiations.

The problem is their   adversaries have a monopoly of coercion and are willing to employ it. ” The nuclear accord signed last summer by Iran and six world powers called for releasing tens of billions of dollars of Iran’s   assets that had been frozen in foreign bank accounts under an international sanctions regime put into place over the past six years. The agreement  —   which hinged on Iran’s willingness to scrap much of its nuclear program  —   also called for lifting restrictions that had severely hampered Iran’s ability to sell oil or collect payments for its products through the international banking system.  Some U. S. sanctions, linked to Iran’s human rights record and support for terrorist groups, will remain in place. The nuclear sanctions, imposed by the Obama administration beginning in 2010 with heavy support from Congress, cut Iran’s oil exports in half and triggered a spike in inflation and joblessness. The economic churn helped ensure the election in 2013 of Rouhani, a moderate cleric and   presidential candidate who promised to seek a rollback of sanctions through a negotiated nuclear accord. Speaking to parliament on Sunday, Rouhani hailed the nuclear agreement as a “golden page” in Iran’s history. “The nuclear deal is an opportunity that we should use to develop the country, improve the welfare of the nation, and create stability and security in the region,” he said, according to wire reports. Iran’s regional rivals fear that the lifting of sanctions will unfetter Iranian   and boost Tehran’s ambitions to become the economic and political hegemon in the Middle East. But Iranian moderates and many U. S. and European officials have expressed cautious hopes that the agreement will help tip the power balance in Tehran in favor of Rouhani and other pragmatists who support rapprochement with the West.  [The ordeal of Post reporter Jason Rezaian]  Some analysts believe that nuclear pact  —   celebrated by millions of ordinary Iranians  —   will help   politicians prevail during parliamentary elections next month. Moreover, many Iranians may be willing to give Rouhani time to demonstrate the benefits of a deal that could lead to a lessening of their country’s isolation. “It’s looking favorable for the centrists and reformists at this early juncture,” said Clifford Kupchan, a former State Department official who is Iran director for the Eurasia Group, a global risk consulting firm. In the optimistic case, Kupchan said, the deal “unleashes a slow,   evolution toward a more politically and economically liberal Iran. ” Yet, enthusiasm in Iran over the nuclear accord’s “Implementation Day” on Saturday could be   if the economy fails to improve. While sanctions helped drive Iran’s economic decline, other forces  —   including historically low oil prices, official corruption and a broken banking system  —   will continue to act as a drag on the country’s fiscal progress for the foreseeable future, analysts say.  Oil prices are down by more than 60 percent since June 2014, cutting still further into Iran’s biggest single source of foreign revenue. Moreover, Western corporations are unlikely to immediately pour investment dollars into Iran, given treaty provisions that allow the sanctions to be quickly   if Iran is caught cheating, said Michael Singh, a former Middle East adviser to the George W. Bush administration. If Iranians’ expectations for a recovery are not realized, he said, Rouhani could quickly lose ground to  . “With oil prices low and corruption endemic in Iran, the economic benefits of the deal may be less than advertised, and they may not trickle down to average Iranians,” said Singh, now the managing director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Thus, the ultimate beneficiaries of the deal may be Iran’s   who could end up collecting the economic benefits of sanctions relief, even as they “receive immunity for provocations” in the Persian Gulf, Syria and beyond, he said. “Given that one of the West’s aims in concluding the nuclear deal appears to have been to strengthen Iran’s pragmatists, this would be an ironic result,” Singh said.  While maintaining the hope that the nuclear deal will strengthen Iran’s moderates, Obama administration officials have acknowledged their limited ability to influence outcomes inside Iran. But U. S. officials insist that the deal has helped make the world safer, regardless of whether Iran is controlled by conservatives or moderates. “Nobody’s turning a blind eye to the fact that this is still a regime that bears significant watching,” State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Friday.  “This isn’t about trust. It’s not about trying to forge a new friendship here,” he said. “It’s about taking a very big step to try to reduce, in the realm of nuclear arms, their ability to do that much more harm to people in the region. ” "

","     Let’s face it: we in the media are suckers for any kind of political story that offers something unpredictable. And like clockwork, every four years someone suggests that there might be a viable   presidential candidacy in the offing, spurring legions of reporters and commentators to lick their lips in anticipation. At the moment the attention is focused on former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, but there is also discussion of whether conservatives might rally around a   candidate if Donald Trump, no true conservative he, becomes the GOP nominee. I have some bad news: It ain’t gonna happen. Not only is Bloomberg not going to run, but if Trump wins the Republican nomination, every last prominent Republican will line up behind him like good soldiers. Let’s start with Bloomberg. Over the weekend, the New York Times reported that he is thinking about running because he’s distressed at the thought of a race between the vulgarian Donald Trump and the socialistic Bernie Sanders. They made it sound like he’s really on his way to a bid: Mr. Bloomberg, 73, has already taken concrete steps toward a possible campaign, and has indicated to friends and allies that he would be willing to spend at least $1 billion of his fortune on it, according to people briefed on his deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss his plans. He has set a deadline for making a final decision in early March, the latest point at which advisers believe Mr. Bloomberg could enter the race and still qualify to appear as an independent candidate on the ballot in all 50 states. He has retained a consultant to help him explore getting his name on those ballots, and his aides have done a detailed study of past   bids. Mr. Bloomberg commissioned a poll in December to see how he might fare against Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, and he intends to conduct another round of polling after the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9 to gauge whether there is indeed an opening for him, according to two people familiar with his intentions. You might read that and say, Holy cow, he’s doing it! But the thing about having $36. 5 billion is that you can explore lots of things without being serious about them. Bloomberg has political consultants who work for him, and he can open the paper one morning, decide he’s troubled by today’s news, then pick up the phone and say to one of those consultants, “Write me up a report on what it would take for me to run for president. ” Then they go off and do a poll, conduct a little research on ballot access, and put together a “plan” in a couple of weeks. Maybe it costs $100, 000 all told to satisfy the boss’s curiosity, but that’s nothing to Bloomberg. And he’s done it before. Here’s an almost identical article in the New York Times from eight years ago, about how he was laying the groundwork for a   run. Practically the only thing that’s different is the date. You might say, “Hey, nobody thought Trump was going to run, either!” Which is true. But Trump found an opening in one of the two parties, and Bloomberg hasn’t suggested running as a Democrat. While I’m sure Bloomberg thinks he’d be an excellent president, he’s also smart enough to know that unlike in New York, where he could swamp the field with money and circumvent the Democratic Party’s dominance in the city, running a national   campaign is a different matter altogether. It’s no accident that there hasn’t been a successful   presidential candidacy in modern American history. The closest anyone came was Teddy Roosevelt’s run in 1912, when he got 27 percent of the vote. In 1992, Ross Perot managed 19 percent of the vote  —   and zero votes in the Electoral College. Perot offers us a hint as to why the talk from some Republicans about a   run is just that, talk. It has come most notably from Bill Kristol, who has been toying with the idea in public for a couple of months now, on the theory that if Donald Trump is the nominee, true conservatives would simply have to find an ideologically true   to promote. Given the horror many conservatives are expressing at the prospect of a Trump nomination, you might be tempted to think they’d sign on to any conservative who decided to run. But don’t believe it for a second. Are those conservatives heartfelt in their anguish about Trump being the GOP nominee? Absolutely. It’s not just that he’d probably lose, it’s that he obviously has no commitment to their ideals; he’s just saying whatever his current audience wants to hear, and once that audience changes (as in a general election) he’ll say completely different things. And who knows how he’d actually govern. And yet, if he is the nominee, Republicans will be faced with a choice. They could launch a   bid, but that would almost certainly guarantee that the Democratic nominee would win. Republicans long ago convinced themselves that Perot delivered the 1992 election to Bill Clinton (even though the evidence makes clear that Perot took votes equally from Bush and Clinton, who won easily and would have done so with or without Perot in the race) so they’d be extremely skittish about repeating that outcome. Far more importantly, if they have to choose between supporting their party’s nominee and mounting an almost certainly doomed   run, their feelings about Donald Trump will be far less critical than their feelings about the Democratic nominee, who will probably be Hillary Clinton  —   for whom they’ve nurtured a passionate loathing for two and a half decades now. We live in an era of “negative partisanship,” in which people’s hatred for the other party has become more central to their political identity than their love for their own party. Faced with the imminent possibility of Clinton sitting in the Oval Office, virtually every Republican will race to get behind Trump. Those now writing articles about what a nightmare a Trump nomination would be will be writing articles touting his virtues. They won’t be dissembling  —   rather, they’ll just be trying to make the best of a bad situation. Once the point of reference is not a more preferable Republican but Hillary Clinton, Trump will look to them like a hero in the making. So as fun as a   presidential race in the fall might be, we in the media won’t be so fortunate. But don’t worry  —   it’s still going to be an interesting election.  "

Whichever idea you find yourself agreeing with, we know one thing is true: The practice of photography is old now, almost 180 years old including the cyanotypes shown above. And with age comes the death of copyright. This month, the New York Public Library announced the release of thousands of documents, including historical photographs, that the public is free to use or display. Among those photographs are some pretty famous photos and portfolios by some talented individuals.

"," George Kennedy, the burly character actor who won an Academy Award as a   leader in “Cool Hand Luke,” threatened Audrey Hepburn as a   villain in “Charade” and was a crusty mainstay of 1970s disaster films before veering into satire as a clueless policeman in the “Naked Gun” film series, died Feb. 28 at a nursing home in Middleton, Idaho. He was 91. The cause was a heart ailment, said Steve Rhodes, chief deputy coroner of Canyon County, Idaho. In a career spanning more than 175 films and television credits, Mr. Kennedy was among the most dependable and versatile performers in Hollywood. Whether malevolent, earnest or serving as comic relief, he held his corner of the screen opposite charismatic movie stars including Cary Grant, Paul Newman, John Wayne and James Stewart. The son of entertainers, Mr. Kennedy was a child actor on radio and spent about 15 years in the Army before reemerging in show business in the late 1950s playing a military police officer on the CBS sitcom “The Phil Silvers Show. ” Mr. Kennedy, who stood    and weighed 300 pounds, made his screen debut as a rebel soldier opposite Kirk Douglas in “Spartacus” (1960). His most important early film was Stanley Donen’s “Charade” (1963) which starred Grant and Hepburn and was an engaging blend of suspense, romance and sophisticated comedy set in Paris.      Mr. Kennedy played one of the World War II veterans who tries to frighten a recent widow (Hepburn) into revealing where her late husband stashed money stolen during the war. Film historian Jeanine Basinger said Mr. Kennedy “can ride that fine line between very scary menacing villain and fitting in with a   comic mode. He had the ability to give subtle variations on his basic persona  —   he could shade it toward comedy, shade it away from comedy. He could live as himself in the universe of the film. This is a movie career  —   steady. ” Indeed it was steady, and Mr. Kennedy remained a welcome presence even if the movies were not always of the highest caliber. After “Charade,” Mr. Kennedy played heavies in “Hush . . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte” and “ ” (both 1964). During the next several years, he had supporting parts in dramas including “Shenandoah,” “The Flight of the Phoenix” and “The Sons of Katie Elder. ” He was a gruff major in the popular war film “The Dirty Dozen. ” Mr. Kennedy’s breakthrough performance was in “Cool Hand Luke” (1967) which starred Newman as a   “hard case” who gets sent to a Southern chain gang for cutting the heads off parking meters. Mr. Kennedy played the veteran convict Drag line, who at first sees Luke as a threat to his authority and nearly kills him in a boxing bout. “Yeah, I beat up Paul Newman and alienated every woman in America,” Mr. Kennedy later quipped. New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther wrote that Mr. Kennedy was “powerfully obsessive as the top dog who handles things his way as effectively and finally as destructively as does the warden or the guards. ” After the success of “Cool Hand Luke,” Mr. Kennedy’s fee shot from $20, 000 to $200, 000 per movie. He began a run of lawman characters in films such as “Hurry Sundown” (1967) the   manhunt drama “The Boston Strangler” (1968) and “. . . Tick . . . Tick . . . Tick” (1970).

","     In a letter apparently written by Osama bin Laden, the late   leader denounced the corporate interests supposedly driving politics in the United States and hailed the courage of the country’s Founding Fathers. Yes, you read that right. The letter is part of a tranche of more than 100 documents released Tuesday by the office of the Director of National Intelligence from the trove of material gathered after the 2011 raid on bin Laden’s secret hideaway in Abbottabad, Pakistan. These include missives sent by the   leader to accomplices, responses received as well as drafts of speeches and other rants he may have penned during his many years in hiding.   [You can read them all here.]   ”The files reinforce the sense that bin Laden was increasingly anxious about security amid an escalating campaign of CIA drone strikes as the   hunt for the   leader wore on,” writes my colleague Greg Miller. ”He also appeared increasingly disconnected from how much his organization had been degraded, calling on deputies to mount operations and fill positions even as they pleaded that they lacked capable recruits.” But one document, titled ”To the American People,” is particularly intriguing. ”I direct my talk specifically to those who support real change, especially the youth,” it begins, before declaiming ”the tyranny of the control of capital by large companies” that has evidently harmed the American economy. The letter is undated but appears to be written around 2009, with references to the recent election of ”Barack Husayn” and the ”six years” of war waged by President George W. Bush in Iraq. It goes on to bemoan the bailout of big banks during the Great Recession and then links the forces in play to the agenda of American warmongers and ”Jewish” interests. Your financial system in its totality was about to collapse within 48 hours had not the administration reverted to using taxpayer’s money to rescue the vultures by using the assets of the victims. As for us, our Iraq was invaded in response to pressure from capitalists with greed for black gold, and you continue to support the oppressive Israelis in their occupation of our Palestine in response to pressures on your administration by a Jewish lobby backed by enormous financial capabilities. The last charge is hardly a surprise, coming as it does from bin Laden, and carries echoes of the   rhetoric of   that infuses jihadist messaging.   [What do we know about Osama bin Laden’s death? Quite a lot, actually.]   But the letter goes on to express some more astonishing concerns and, at times, sounds as if it could have been written by any   politician in the United States. It prefaces a critique of the Supreme Court’s landmark Citizens United v. FEC ruling with this lengthy tirade against the political and corporate elites that control the levers of power. The course of the policies of the present administration in several areas clearly reveals that whoever enters the White House, even with good intentions to safeguard the peoples’ interest, is no more than a train operator. His only task is to keep the train on the tracks that are laid down by the lobbyists in New York and Washington to serve their interests first, even if it is counter to your security and economy. Any president who tries to move the train from the lobbyist’s tracks to a track for the American people’s interests will confront very strong opposition and pressures from the lobbyists. It calls on young Americans not to embrace Republicans or Democrats but a ”great revolution for freedom” that would empower Obama to make change. ”[That change] does not only include improvement of your economic situation and ensure your security, but more importantly, helps [Obama] in making a rational decision to save humanity from the harmful [greenhouse] gases that threaten its destiny,” the letter advises. It does not go into any further details about the threat of climate change. Now, at this point, you would think the jihadist letter writer would just cut to the chase and declare that the solution is simply to convert to his particularly puritanical form of Islam and embrace its edicts as law. But you would be wrong. The letter recommends Americans ”relive the history of their ancestors and the conditions in their country more than two centuries ago.” Read Thomas Paine, it urges (not the Koran). ”The British Parliament sided with corporations, then against the interests of the citizens,” the letter states. ”You have noticed the Congress’s stand with corporations against the peoples’ interests when they refused to legislate against interference in the elections by corporations.” Then it goes on to extol the convictions and endeavor of the United States’ revolutionary heroes, who apparently would not want their country’s policies hijacked by corporate interests, such as those of the British East India Co. that bogeyman of the late 18th century. ”You also are in need of men with courage and initiative like those of your forefathers at that time when they refused to allow one company to harm the interests of the United States, a company that had a monopoly on tea and its prices,” the letter says. It then extends the lesson to more familiar terrain, condemning what it deems the cabal of policymakers and shadowy interests that somehow perpetuate Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory. And it ends on a predictable note: ”The United States shall pay for its arrogance with the blood of Christians and their funds. Peace be upon those who follow the righteous track.”    New documents released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence reveal more information about Osama bin Laden and  .

"," The other day, as I pushed my cart around Whole Foods, a new book touting the wonders of apple cider vinegar caught me by surprise. Mainly, I was taken aback that people still considered the ingredient a magic elixir. I was under the impression that notion had been debunked way back when phones still had cords. People have been writing books on the subject at least since that era, and apparently they haven’t stopped. A quick search on Amazon revealed more than 20, 000 results for publications on apple cider vinegar, many written in the past several years and most subtitled with words such as “natural miracle cure,” “detox,” “weight loss,” “healing power” and “ . ” Clearly, this   liquid still has some allure, so I decided to investigate if there is any research to back it up. It turns out there is substantial evidence that consuming vinegar can help keep blood sugar under control, which in turn may ultimately decrease the risk of diabetes and heart disease, among other benefits. Carol S. Johnston, associate director of the nutrition program at Arizona State University, who has been studying the effects of vinegar for more than 10 years, says, “Vinegar appears to inhibit the enzymes that help you digest starch. ” When starch is not completely digested, you get a smaller blood sugar (glycemic) response  —   “ % less in healthy people and in diabetics”  —   after eating a   food such as a bagel, according to Johnston’s findings. The vinegar has a more moderate   impact when a   whole grain is eaten (because there is less of a spike to begin with) and no effect when no starch is eaten. On top of that, undigested starch may have a prebiotic effect, meaning as it passes through the intestines it becomes food for the good bacteria in your gut.   gut bacteria generally translates to a healthier you because these microorganisms help support good digestion and our immune systems, among other benefits. Those undigested starch calories may also add up over time to some weight loss, plus, according to Johnston, “there is emerging research that vinegar might increase fat oxidation. ” She stresses, however, that contrary to many of those popular book titles, “vinegar is not a magic bullet for weight loss. I have seen very modest weight loss in my studies, of one to two pounds after 12 weeks. ” In the one study published, in Japan in 2009, that specifically examined vinegar’s impact on weight, subjects lost just two to four pounds in 12 weeks. Better   control, possible modest weight loss and better gut health seem like valid, if not exactly miraculous, benefits. Maybe there is something to this apple cider vinegar thing after all? But wait  —   there is a catch. “There is great marketing behind apple cider vinegar, and it works to lower the glycemic response, but it doesn’t have to be apple cider vinegar,” Johnston says. She says the active   ingredient in vinegar is acetic acid, which is in all vinegars. She personally prefers the taste of red wine vinegar, which she says works just as well, as does white distilled vinegar, for example.

141689,212558,The ‘big price’ Paul Ryan has paid for supporting Donald Trump,Washington Post,George F. Will,2016-06-06,2016.0,6.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160607000353/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-big-price-paul-ryan-has-paid-for-supporting-donald-trump/2016/06/06/5c8f2f64-2c08-11e6-9b37-42985f6a265c_story.html
"," The Caligulan malice with which Donald Trump administered Paul Ryan’s degradation is an object lesson in the price of abject capitulation to power. This episode should be studied as a clinical case of a particular Washington myopia  —   the ability of career politicians to convince themselves that they and their agendas are of supreme importance.  The pornographic politics of Trump’s presidential campaign, which was preceded by decades of ignorant bile (about Barack Obama’s birth certificate and much else) have not exhausted Trump’s eagerness to plumb new depths of destructiveness. Herewith the remarkably brief timeline of the breaking of Ryan to Trump’s saddle.  On May 3, Trump won the Indiana primary, ending competition for the Republican nomination. On May 5, Ryan said he still was not prepared to endorse Trump. That day Trump responded that he was not ready to endorse Ryan’s agenda. This was not news, considering that Trump has campaigned against every significant element of this agenda  —   entitlement reform, the rule of law, revival of Congress as a counter to the executive overreach that Obama has practiced and that Trump promises to enlarge upon.  On May 12, a Trump meeting with Ryan resulted in a cringeworthy joint statement that had to be read to be properly disbelieved. The two spoke about the “great conversation” they had about “our shared principles. ” They celebrated their “many important areas of common ground” while offhandedly mentioning “our few differences. ” Those who know, or thought they knew, Ryan doubted that he could name a single shared principle, and he did not do so.  In spite of, and in conspicuous dissonance with, the May 12 happy talk, Ryan continued to withhold his endorsement. Perhaps he hoped that Trump, at age 69, was going to mend his manners.  Instead, Trump dragged a personal problem, his coming trial on fraud charges associated with Trump University, into the presidential campaign. Having first done so in February, on May 27 he again attacked the “Mexican” judge (born in Indiana, 1, 332 miles from Mexico) who will preside at the trial, asserting that the Hoosier Mexican was unfit to preside because his ethnic heritage would incline him against Trump, the   scourge of Mexican rapists. On May 30, Trump again attacked the judge, again embracing the identity politics that actually characterizes contemporary progressivism: An individual has, always and only, the interests and motivations of his race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation.  By June 2, Ryan had heard enough. He endorsed Trump. He did so because President Trump would sign Ryan’s House “agenda. ” Well. Since May 5, the Hamlet of southeastern Wisconsin had indeed learned something. He had learned Trump’s contemptuous response to his scruples. Trump’s response was an insouciant intensification of his   politics  —   the judicial system, too, is “rigged. ” Ryan limply described Trump’s attack on the judge as thinking “out of left field” that he could not “relate to. ”  All supposedly will be redeemed by the House agenda. So, assume, fancifully, that in 2017 this agenda emerges intact from a House not yet proved able to pass 12 appropriations bills. Assume, too, that Republicans still control the Senate and can persuade enough Democrats to push the House agenda over the   threshold. Now, for some really strenuous assuming: Assume that whatever semblance of the House agenda that reaches President Trump’s desk is more important than keeping this impetuous, vicious, ignorant and   man from being at that desk. Some say in extenuation of Ryan’s behavior that if he could not embrace Trump, he could not continue as speaker. But is Ryan, who was reluctant to become speaker, now more indispensable to the nation’s civic health than Trump is menacing to that health? Ryan could have enhanced that health by valuing it above his office.  In March, Trump said of Ryan: “I’m sure I’m going to get along great with him. And if I don’t, he’s going to have to pay a big price. ” Ryan has now paid a staggering price by getting along with Trump. And what did Ryan purchase with the coin of his reputation?

","       The first message Mina Justice received from her son Sunday morning seemed innocuous. “Mommy I love you,” Eddie Justice texted at 2:06 a. m. His next words, though, were chilling. “In club,” he wrote. “They shooting. ” Worried and confused, Mina tried calling her son, but there was no answer, she told the Associated Press. She texted him to ask whether he was okay. “Trapp in bathroom,” Eddie wrote a minute later. “Pulse. Downtown. Call police. ” Mina didn’t know it yet, but her son was caught in the midst of what would prove to be the worst mass shooting in U. S. history. At that instant, Omar Mateen, a    security guard, was stalking Pulse, a popular Orlando gay club, with an assault rifle and pistol. He would kill 50 people and wound at least 53 more before dying in a shootout with police.   [Gunman who killed 50 in Orlando nightclub had pledged allegiance to ISIS]   Sleeping just a moment before, Mina had now been propelled into a waking nightmare. For 44 minutes, she sat in the dark, staring at her phone, watching the attack unfold in increasingly terrified texts from her son. Then the texts stopped. The moving messages, first reported by the Associated Press’s Tamara Lush, are one man’s window into a tragedy that has gripped the nation and rekindled debates over immigration, Islam, gay rights and gun control. Before the mass shooting made international headlines, however, news of the incident spread on social media and in panicked texts from people trapped inside the club. “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running,” the club wrote on its Facebook page at 2:09 a. m. Seconds earlier, Eddie Justice had again texted his mom. “I’m gonna die,” he wrote. She called 911.    49 people were killed at a nightclub in Orlando when a gunman who pledged loyalty to the Islamic State opened fire and took hostages. Here are the victims. (Victoria   Washington Post)    Eddie was handsome and athletic with tattoos that peeked out of his shirt, and he had a penchant for flashy jewelry, according to Facebook photos. He liked to make others laugh. His work as an accountant afforded him a condo in downtown Orlando, his mother told the AP. “Lives in a sky house, like the Jeffersons,” Mina would say. “He lives rich. ” Now her handsome,   son desperately needed her help. As she talked to the emergency dispatcher, she texted Eddie. “U still in there,” she wrote, according to the AP. “Answer [your] damn phone. ” Finally, at 2:39 a. m. he replied. “Call them mommy,” Eddie wrote, apparently in reference to the police. “Now. ” He said he was in Pulse’s bathroom. “He’s coming,” Eddie wrote. “I’m gonna die. ”    Text messages Mina Justice’s son sent to her while he was in a bathroom at Pulse. (Tamara  )  When Mina asked whether people were hurt, her son said: “Lots. Yes. ” When her son’s texts paused once again, she hopefully asked whether the police had arrived and found him. “No,” he replied. “Still here in bathroom. He has us. They need to come get us. ” Unknown to mother and son, though, police were outside the club but delaying their assault because of the hostage situation, a senior U. S. law enforcement official told The Washington Post. For three hours, the gunman was on the phone with police, and no shots were fired. So when Mina texted her son at 2:49 a. m. asking him to let her know when he saw the police, he answered with panic. “Hurry,” he wrote, according to the AP. “He’s in the bathroom with us. ” “Is the man in the bathroom wit u?” she asked. “He’s a terror,” Eddie wrote at 2:50 a. m. before answering her question: “Yes. ” “Are u hurt?” Mina wrote. “Stay there he don’t like gay people,” she wrote again. “Text me please,” she begged. “I love u. ” Eddie never answered.    Mina Justice speaks to a reporter discussing texting with her son, Eddie Justice, who was in a bathroom at Pulse in Orlando. (Tamara  )  Mina drove downtown to Pulse to await word from the police. When she got no answers Sunday morning, she made her way to the nearby Hampton Inn and Suites, a makeshift waiting area for families of those inside the club during the shooting. Some of Eddie’s relatives took to social media to express their hope that he was still alive. “Please say a prayer for my lil cousin, God bring him home safe and sound,” Jeffery Robinson wrote on Facebook. “This is a tragedy for all families involved and it’s time to come together and take a stand regardless of what color, race, sex, or sexual preference. ” “Fear is a powerful thing,” wrote Nerelsha   Eddie’s sister, as she raced to Orlando. “As I travel down this road with all my thoughts kept inside   …     it is overcoming my body   …     I need someone to reach out there hands   …     waiting and praying for the miracle worker JESUS   …     waiting on your glory lord! !! Y’all gonna have to excuse me   …     trying to keep it together in this backseat. ” In the hotel lobby, there were scenes of intense grief as families learned that their loved ones had died inside the club. One woman sat in a chair next to a stack of pizza boxes, sobbing and screaming. Another woman was so overcome that she vomited. Still, Mina Justice had not heard news of her son. “His name has not come up yet, and that’s scary,” she told the AP. “It’s just   …    ” she said, pausing and patting her heart. “It’s just, I got this feeling. I got a bad feeling. ” Late on Sunday night, her bad feeling was confirmed. Eddie Jamoldroy Justice’s name was added to the list of the dead. Mina could not be reached for comment Sunday night. But her nephew captured the family’s emotion on Facebook. “Terrible tragedy for my family,” Robinson wrote. “Great young man gone way too soon. ” A GoFundMe page has been established to collect money for his funeral. “Eddie loved his mother,” the page notes, “and was a momma’s boy at heart. ”              Caption   Officials say at least 49 people were killed and dozens were injured in the shooting.

142500,213582,U.S. planes grounded at key Turkish air base in fight against ISIS after coup attempt,Washington Post,Dan Lamothe,2016-07-16,2016.0,7.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160716000052/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/07/15/u-s-militarys-counter-isis-operations-from-turkey-left-uncertain-amid-coup-attempt/
","       The U. S. military on Saturday was working with officials in Turkey to get a key air base operational in the fight against the Islamic State. Security was boosted to its highest level at bases across Turkey during Friday’s coup attempt against the Turkish government, a measure typically reserved for when there is an ongoing terrorist attack. A U. S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations, said Saturday that force protection was elevated Friday night to level Delta. That typically signifies a terrorist attack has occurred or that one is considered imminent nearby.   [Turkey foils bloody coup attempt]   Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said Saturday that the Turkish government’s decision to close its airspace to military aircraft resulted in the halting of air operations at Incirlik Air Base, in the southern part of the country near Syria. “U. S. officials are working with the Turks to resume air operations there as soon as possible,” Cook said. “In the meantime, U. S. Central Command is adjusting flight operations in the   campaign to minimize any effects on the campaign. U. S. facilities at Incirlik are operating on internal power sources and a loss of commercial power to the base has not affected base operations. ” The Pentagon has increasingly relied on Turkish military installations as the United States has waged its war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In particular, U. S. troops at Incirlik and at Diyarbakir Air Base in the southeastern part of the country both have a direct role in the military campaign against the militants.   [The coup in Turkey could lead to uncertainty in   fight]   At Incirlik, the United States has based   attack planes,   tankers and unmanned aircraft. An Air Force commander there said in May that his unit handled   of all refueling operations for the air war over Iraq and Syria. An   squadron has been based at Incirlik since October 2015, after the Turkish government allowed U. S. strike aircraft to use the base. Use of the base immediately improved how long the aircraft could remain over Iraq and Syria, considering its proximity when compared with other military bases used by the Pentagon in Persian Gulf countries. At Diyarbakir, the Air Force began staging small numbers of U. S. troops last fall in case   missions were required. The installation is home to Turkey’s 8th Air Wing and was not planned as a permanent home for U. S. troops, U. S. military officials have said. Senior defense officials also said in April that they were planning to place a mobile rocket system known as HIMARS, short for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, somewhere in Turkey to support U. S. operations in Syria. In other parts of Turkey, U. S. troops use an air base in Izmir, some 300 miles southwest of Istanbul, and Aksaz Naval Base, on the Aegean coast. In March, the Pentagon and State Department ordered families of U. S. troops and diplomats to leave the country, citing security concerns raised by terrorist attacks across Turkey.   [Pentagon and State Department order families of U. S. troops and diplomats to leave Turkey]   It was not immediately clear what increased security measures were taken at U. S. diplomatic facilities in Turkey. A statement released Saturday by the U. S. Embassy in Ankara warned that the airport in Istanbul still wasn’t safe to use. “We urge U. S. citizens to contact family and friends to let them know you are safe,” embassy officials said. “We have seen reports that social media is blocked, but you can contact friends and family by email, telephone or SMS.  We encourage U. S. citizens to shelter in place and do not go the U. S. Embassy or Consulates at this time. ” But the defense official said the State Department has not requested the U. S. military to reinforce any of its diplomatic facilities in Turkey, which include the embassy in the capital of Ankara and consulates in Istanbul and Adana. No Americans were flown out of Turkey by the U. S. military during the coup attempt, the official added. This story has been updated multiple times.

","     When Andrea Tantaros filed her Aug. 22 sexual harassment suit against Fox News and various top executives, she spared few colleagues. Defendants included the network itself, former chief Roger Ailes and four top executives. “The fish stinks from the head,” alleges the complaint, citing a coterie of lieutenants who “condoned” the alleged harassment by Ailes. Broadening out from there, the suit cited the names of various colleagues who were only remotely related to the charges at hand. For instance, the document alleges that Ailes gossiped with Tantaros about various Fox News personalities. He reportedly said the following inappropriate things:     Not content to allow these folks to be thus embarrassed, Fox News, in a Monday filing that seeks to steer Tantaros’ suit into the secret world of arbitration, stood up for these folks. Such “gratuitous allegations,” says the Fox News motion, “serve no purpose other than to embarrass these individuals, and require a response. ” That response relies on resumes. For instance: “Shannon Bream is an attorney whose legal acumen as Fox News’ Supreme Court correspondent is known to viewers throughout the country. ” And: “Monica Crowley’s distinguished career includes 20 years as a journalist. Earlier, she worked for the White House when she was just 22 years old. ”      Former Fox News host Andrea Tantaros filed a lawsuit against the network, becoming the second host in two months to accuse former network chairman Roger Ailes of sexual harassment. (Erin Patrick O’  Washington Post)   In a passage with greater consequences, the Fox News motion carries the rebuttals of three   whose alleged misconduct is cited in the Tantaros complaint. From the filing: Former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown made “sexually inappropriate comments” to Tantaros on the set of “Outnumbered” and put his hands on her “lower waist”; commentator Ben Collins made “unwanted sexual advances” toward Tantaros; and Fox News correspondent John Roberts “highly inappropriate comments” to Tantaros, including this question: “Have you frozen your eggs?” Again, the Fox News motion relies in part on biography to rebut these allegations: John Roberts has been a journalist for 40 years and was inducted into the Canadian Broadcast Hall of Fame. Tantaros’s allegation that he asked her an improper question relating to in vitro fertilization is dishonest and takes Roberts’s words entirely out of context (they occurred after several serious discussions with Roberts and his wife about his wife’s forthcoming book on this subject). Scott Brown served as a United States Senator and as a Judge Advocate General in the Massachusetts Army National Guard. His interactions with Tantaros were professional and cordial, and in full view of other personnel and talent. Ben Collins is a former Green Beret. He was utterly stunned to learn of Tantaros’s accusations, and vehemently denies them. That all makes sense. A network accused of rampant sexism must defend itself and its people. In this case, not all of its people, however. King of Cable News Bill O’Reilly stands accused in the Tantaros suit of pursuing his colleague, though he’s not named as a defendant in the suit. Here’s O’Reilly’s moment in the complaint: [C]ommencing in February 2016, Bill O’Reilly (“O’Reilly”) whom Tantaros had considered to be a good friend and a person from whom she sought career guidance, started sexually harassing her by, inter alia, (a) asking her to come to stay with him on Long Island where it would be “very private,” and (b) telling her on more than one occasion that he could “see [her] as a wild girl,” and that he believed that she had a “wild side. ” So there are the allegations in the Tantaros suit; where is the rebuttal in the Fox News motion? It’s not in there. The Erik Wemple Blog this morning asked Fox News about the situation, and a spokesperson issued this statement: “There is nothing to defend in Tantaros’s suit because Mr. O’Reilly is not a defendant. He is mentioned once in a 37 page complaint, and that mention is not worth defending because it is untrue. ” Fred Newman, a lawyer for O’Reilly, told The Post’s Paul Farhi just about the same thing: “I don’t think you should read anything into it. There is nothing to defend in Tantaros’s suit because Mr. O’Reilly is not a defendant. He is mentioned once in a   complaint, and that mention is not worth defending because it is untrue. ” Never let it be said that Fox News and the attorney for its   hosts aren’t on message. When a lawyer cautions against reading “anything into” something, alas, it’s often a good idea to read a lot into it. Here, Fox News left its meal ticket, the host of cable news’ leading program for years, dangling in the margins of a damaging lawsuit. There’s been a great deal of chatter about what will happen to O’Reilly now that Ailes, his great protector, is out of the building. His contract expires next year and he’s said that he doesn’t want to keep working so hard.      Former Fox News host Andrea Tantaros filed a lawsuit against the network, becoming the second host in two months to accuse former network chairman Roger Ailes of sexual harassment.

143669,215043,Merkelâ€™s election woes are a warning to Berlin,Washington Post,Constanze StelzenmÃ¼ller,2016-09-07,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160908002249/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2016/09/07/merkels-election-woes-are-a-warning-to-berlin/
","     For years, Germany seemed immune to the forces of populist discontent raging on both sides of the Atlantic, a lone island of calm and stability. That ended on Sunday, when an election in the   state of   Pomerania gave the   party Alternative for Germany (AfD) 20. 8 percent of the vote. It sent a nervous shudder throughout the country, shocking allies and neighbors. At home, Chancellor Angela Merkel s friends and foes alike are suddenly sniffing opportunity, one year out from national elections. Is this the twilight of her nearly   reign? On the face of it, the state many Germans simply refer to as    ? is an unlikely candidate for a bellwether of change. Abutting the Baltic Sea, it is quietly lovely but impoverished and sparsely populated; a place of sandy soils, lakes, and pines where time seems to flow in big slow loops. It is the home state of President Joachim Gauck as well as Chancellor Merkel ”a fact which its famously taciturn inhabitants appear to regard not so much as a source of civic pride but as proof that nothing good happens to those who leave home and get ahead of themselves. It houses two percent of the country s citizens, produces 1. 3 percent of GDP, and has an unemployment rate of 9 percent (national average: 6). Its few immigrants are mostly Poles or German Russians. Of the   refugees who began arriving a year ago, it has taken in a mere 23, 000. In a speech on Wednesday in Berlin to Germany s federal legislature, Merkel said the AfD  is a challenge to all of us in this house. ? But she added:  I m very convinced that if we keep our composure and stand by the truth, then we ll win  ” and we ll win back the most important thing we need, the trust of the people. ? Still, there are good reasons for the national jitters. Campaigning on a stridently   ticket, the    AfD achieved a spectacular second place behind the incumbent Social Democrats ”thereby winning a bet on casting the election as a protest referendum on the chancellor s refugee policy. Worse, this is the first time in postwar history that a populist challenger has overtaken Merkel s   Christian Democrats on the right in one of Germany s sixteen states and pushed it into third place. That it is home to the chancellor s own constituency makes for an added sting. Thomas Schmid, a former   renegade who now writes a thoughtful blog for the conservative daily Die Welt, has suggested that Sunday s upset is due to democracy and civil society being less firmly rooted in formerly communist East Germany. There is some evidence for that, including startlingly high support for Russia s President Vladimir Putin. Yet it s also a somewhat condescending take. East Germans do have legitimate grievances against what they see as an entitled and aloof political establishment. Carpetbaggers from the West who took all the best jobs after unification in 1990 come to mind; and pensions are still lower in the East than in the West, a   later. But the AfD is neither a creation of the east, nor is it confined to it. It has fielded candidates in ten of the eleven states that have held elections since its founding in February 2013 ”five in the West and five in the East. It vaulted over the 5 percent entry threshold in all except one ”with   wins in every election held since Merkel welcomed a historic influx of refugees a year ago with the now legendary phrase, wir schaffen das (we can do it). In Mecklenburg, the AfD was able to push voter turnout up by 10 percent and poach voters from all the parties, including the extreme left and right. Even more significantly, it was able to mobilize a large group of   ”as it did in the last three regional elections before. No wonder politicians in Berlin are alarmed. The AfD s often shambolic and disruptive public image makes it easy to underestimate its impact. It magnifies and manipulates voters  fears and grievances, but it is not wasting time by attempting to redress them. By all accounts, its state representatives have spent far more time fighting with each other than on making laws. At the same time, the AfD has undergone a highly deliberate metamorphosis from a Eurosceptic voice on the right to an increasingly nationalist and xenophobic bloc. It does nothing to disassociate itself from     racist, or   supporters. It defames fundamental constitutional values and representative democracy. It is reaching out to the conservative mainstream by flaunting its connections to   thinkers of the  New Right. ? It is actively seeking to ally itself with extreme rightwing movements at home and abroad, from the local Pegida demonstrations to France s Marine le Pen or the Netherlands  Geert Wilders. In nationwide polls, it has consistently been registering   percent support; not from the dispossessed and disadvantaged, but from middle class men and women raging about social changes they don t like. No mistake, the AfD is in combat mode. Its target, however, is not class warfare ”but the culture wars. For now, the AfD is still a fringe force. But it is dangerous, and needs to be taken seriously, because it is already putting the established parties on the defensive and changing the terms of the national debate. Its national leaders, who regularly claim that their party represents  true  popular opinion, have made no bones about their ultimate target:  We want to run the country.  Merkel ”who has not declared yet whether she will run again in 2017 ”appears calmly determined to stay the course despite her sinking popularity figures. She can point to the fact that incoming refugee numbers have dwindled to a trickle, and that the country s communities have geared up to better integrating those who will stay. And she can take reassurance from the absence of a serious challenger to her stature. But if she wants to have the choice of running again, she will have to do better at explaining to Germans and their neighbors why her morally admirable decision to let in the refugees is also good for the country, and for Europe. What is at stake is nothing less than the future of both. Constanze StelzenmÃ¼ller is a contributing columnist for the Washington Post and Robert Bosch Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution.

143800,215200,Meet Donald Trump’s ‘basket of deplorables’,Washington Post,Jenna Johnson,2016-09-13,2016.0,9.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160914000600/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/meet-donald-trumps-basket-of-deplorables/2016/09/13/f90d5da6-7989-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html
","  ASHEVILLE, N. C.  —   As thousands of Donald Trump’s supporters left his rally here this week, they were greeted by protesters who accused them of being, among other things, racist, hateful and uneducated. “Grow a brain,     !” one protester shouted at a Trump backer. Another pointed at rallygoers and yelled: “Racist       !” A third held a sign that read: “Make racists afraid again. ” Then they chanted in unison: “Love trumps hate! Love trumps hate! Love trumps hate!” “They have these vulgar signs, yet they’re screaming about love,” said Lisa Jones, 51, a Trump supporter from Hendersonville, N. C. “And we’re the ones that are intolerant? We’re deplorable and intolerant? Well, we just found out that we’re deplorable. We thought that we were just intolerant. ” Many rallygoers here in this mountain town Monday evening shrugged off Hillary Clinton’s controversial remark that “half” of Trump’s supporters belong in a “basket of deplorables” because they are “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it. ” While the Democratic candidate has expressed regret for using the word “half,” she has not abandoned her assertion that some of Trump’s supporters are truly deplorable.     Journalist Richard Morgan traveled to Altoona, Pa. with the goal of getting a deeper sense of what drives a Trump supporter firsthand. This is who he met. (Adriana   Washington Post)   “It made me feel real little,” said John Warren, 72, of Asheville, who wore a camouflage “Make America Great Again” cap. “That she was downplaying us. I mean, we are voters and, you know, we respect her. But not in the position she is running for. ”  [The Take: Clinton’s ‘deplorables’ remark sums up a deplorable election season]  Many Trump supporters say they have been called much worse for their views on   marriage, abortion, transgender rights, Syrian refugees, illegal immigration and race relations. Like the Republican nominee, they say they aren’t afraid to say politically incorrect things and no amount of   from liberals is going to change that. “One man’s steak is another man’s baloney,” said a    salesman from Tennessee who said he was proud to have sold 14 Confederate flags outside the rally but did not want his name published. “Just like a woman: I mean, I might say she’s beautiful. The next guy might say she’s ugly. You know what I’m saying?” A    construction project manager dressed up as a “deplorable,” putting a laundry basket over his head. Another man carried a sign reading: “Deplorable lives matter. ” As two young men left the rally, one turned to the other and said, “Okay, Dan, let’s go be deplorable. ” During the event, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani joked that Clinton had mentioned “some phobics I’ve never heard of” and that “maybe the claustrophobics are for Trump. ” Trump pulled supporters on stage to share their thoughts, concluding: “These are not deplorable people. That I can tell you. ” The Trump campaign has focused heavily on the “deplorables” theme as a way to paint Clinton as elitist and out of touch, but it has also stumbled into its own problems with the issue.   Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. posted a picture labeled “The Deplorables” on Instagram over the weekend that placed his father and several Trump surrogates alongside conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and a cartoon character, Pepe the Frog, associated with the online white nationalist   movement. Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence has refused to use the word “deplorable” to describe former Ku Klux Klan leader and Trump supporter David Duke, though he said Tuesday that he and Donald Trump disavow Duke.  [Cheers, a punch, a slur: What it’s like in the crowd at a Donald Trump rally]  The Clinton campaign points to such incidents, as well as polls showing that many Trump supporters harbor prejudiced views of nonwhites, as evidence that many Trump backers are indeed deplorable. At the Monday night rally, one protester held a sign that read “Deplorable Trump misleads good people. ” Some here acknowledged that a small fraction of Trump backers could be seen as having deplorable views, but they added that every movement has a fringe. “Some of them are, but I am a   logical person,” said Joe Pruden, 26, a plumber from Asheville, whose girlfriend’s weight was mocked by a protester. He continued: “Trump supporters, they’re on the defense, and I’ve been talking to other conservatives and saying, ‘Hey, we need to start standing up, man.’ We are done being bullied into a corner by these liberal,   progressive Nazi foot soldiers. ” Kathy Campbell, 40, said Trump could avoid some of the criticism by more carefully choosing his words. “Trump has a way about him that comes off sounding mean and hateful,” said Campbell, who lives in North Carolina’s Rutherford County and originally supported Sen. Marco Rubio ( . ). “I don’t care for his tone sometimes because I think you catch more flies with honey. ” Campbell likes that Trump would crack down on illegal immigration and the public aid undocumented workers receive. She said her children were on Medicaid for a total of 20 years and, as a single mother, she needed the assistance of food stamps for five years, even though she was working full time. “The women who are sitting on their asses at home that can work, and they keep having baby after baby after baby just so they can keep getting more and more food stamps? They’re abusing the system,” Campbell said.  [Inside Donald Trump’s new strategy to counter the view that he is ‘racist’]  She added: “I’m a deplorable. Whatever. I’m also called  . You know what? There is so much talk about tolerance. Where’s the tolerance for me as a Christian? Where’s the tolerance for me as a Republican? There’s none. ” This sentiment is common among conservatives here in North Carolina, where Republican lawmakers sparked a national backlash by enacting legislation that weakened   protections for gays and lesbians and that requires transgender people to use public restrooms that correspond to the gender on their birth certificates. Shannon Niven, a    nursing student and mother of two from Transylvania County, said Trump supporters like her are educated and accepting  —   but tired of having the values of others forced upon their lives. She said the debate over the rights of transgender people, who she believes have a “mental illness,” shows how much society has changed in the past decade or two. “Let a man come into the bathroom with my little girl, and he may not make it out,” she said. “North Carolina  —   we’re conservative, we’re Christian, but we’re also a little crazy, and we will defend ourselves. ” The supporters and protesters who showed up to the rally had mostly made up their minds about the election, but each side tried to sway the other anyway. Brenda Lilly, a Clinton backer who teaches in Asheville, chatted with a young couple outside the event and tried to warn them about Trump. “He is a racist. He’s a racist. What makes you think that he’s not?” Lilly said, giving a few examples, including Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims. “It’s only temporary,” the teenage girl, who will not be old enough to vote in November, said as she held a Trump flag over her head. “Temporary! That’s what they said about Jews in Germany,” Lilly responded. “Please, read your history. I beg you. ”  [Seven percent of Donald Trump supporters think he’s a racist]  Lilly also debated with Michelle Visconte, 47, who says Trump was right to label illegal immigrants as rapists and criminals. “I dated Hispanic men all of my life, and now I’m just like, I’m done. I’m done,” Visconte said. “Because you know what? They’re here to bleed us and take advantage of whatever they can get. ” “No, they’re not,” said Lilly, who lived in California for 27 years before recently returning to North Carolina. “Were all of your boyfriends rapists and criminals?” “Not every one. I had a couple good ones,” Visconte said. “Were they all criminals?” Lilly asked. “No,” Visconte replied. “Wait a minute, wait a minute: Yes, they were criminals if they came over to the United States illegally. That’s a criminal. ” Conversations like this exasperated Lilly and confirmed what she had suspected. “Quite frankly, I think 50 percent could be a small percentage,” she said of the size of the “basket of deplorables. ” “These people are nuts. And I don’t think they all are. I think there probably are some fine people. ” After the rally, arguments between supporters and protesters continued. Two younger demonstrators got into a nasty yelling match with an older man wearing a profane    ; they all took videos of one another saying or doing unkind things. Friends intervened and a police officer begged, “Please, just be nice. ” Later, as a young man wearing an “Obama can’t ban these guns” tank top flexed his muscles for a photo, a young female protester threw a cup of water on him and ran away. As he pulled the wet shirt off, he yelled, “That         !” As the two sides exchanged nasty words, an older activist took the lead in denouncing the Trump supporters, while a motherly woman leaving the rally urged the young men to go home before a fight broke out. She then turned to the   protester and asked why he was trying to incite a fight. “They need to be called out,” he said. “They need to be called out for their racism. ”  Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.

","   Robert L. Wilkins, a judge on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit, served on the presidential commission created by Congress to plan the National Museum of African American History and Culture. His book on the creation of the museum, “Long Road to Hard Truth,” was released this month.        Lewis Fraction never imagined that his death would help inspire work toward a museum on the Mall. “Brother” Fraction and I were mentors in a church youth program when he died 20 years ago, just shy of his 60th birthday, leaving behind a wife and four grown children. While at his home to comfort his family and remember his life, I was struck by the stories told by the elders gathered there. Stories about the myriad joys of youth  —   the courtship rituals, old dance steps, swooning over Sam Cooke. Stories about     ramshackle schoolhouses and the nurturing but stern teachers who presided over them. Some described never seeing a whole piece of chalk or a new textbook  —   just broken bits and   books handed down from white schools. There were stories about countless indignities, major and minor, and the psychological wounds they inflicted. Magnificent stories. Awful stories. Profound stories. As we drove home that evening, I asked my wife, “Why don’t we have a museum to tell all of those stories?” This question came with a lot of background. I had spent six years on the front lines of the   system as a public defender and seen so much tragedy. When I started on the job, the nation was still in the middle of the crack epidemic and the District was known as the “Murder Capital of the Nation. ” I had seen too many gunshot wounds, autopsy reports and bloody   photos. I had visited far too many victims in hospital beds, clients in jail cells, family members in dingy apartments and witnesses on dangerous street corners. One day I was looking for a witness in the middle of the afternoon when a dilapidated station wagon drove slowly down the street with four or five guys inside. The front passenger was holding an   rifle pointed upward and at the ready. Fortunately, the car drove past without incident. Back then, folks called those “war wagons. ” I was growing weary of the war.  I was also weary of feeling as if I were always on defense. I knew what it meant to be treated differently as a black man. In May 1992, while returning home from my grandfather’s funeral in Chicago, three family members and I were detained by Maryland State Police so they could carry out a search by a   dog. It didn’t matter that we refused to sign a    form, or that we explained that we were returning from a funeral, or that I told the officer the name and date of the Supreme Court case that his actions violated. As we learned after filing a lawsuit, the only thing that mattered was that we fit a written directive given to the troopers, instructing them to target blacks in rental cars traveling along that stretch of highway.  The settlement of our lawsuit in 1995 required Maryland State Police to document their search practices, including the race of those searched and information on what, if anything, was found. The resulting data revealed an astonishing disparity. The reports showed that the number of black people found with drugs was four times as high as the number of whites found with drugs. But here was the remarkable part: Four times as many blacks were searched in the first place.  It was disillusioning and depressing. So on that evening in 1996, remembering a loved one, I was inspired to become part of something positive. I wanted to help build a museum, so that those stories  —   the painful and the wonderful  —   would finally have a home. And they could serve a broader purpose. Young people who skipped school or found themselves in trouble with the law could learn about the brave youths of prior generations who were threatened, cursed and spat upon as they sought to attend better schools; they could see and hear the countless stories of how African Americans with little hope and even fewer resources were able to fight for freedom, seek justice and change laws and attitudes. This could be a place of optimism. And after witnessing so much racial division throughout my life, those stories could serve another important purpose: unity. Even though relating this past would cause some pain, and some shame, an honest examination of this history could help us learn from the past and think about how we can come closer together as a nation. Many others had this same inspiration. The first were in 1916, when a group of African American leaders came together to create a “National Memorial Building” dedicated “as a tribute to the Negro’s contribution to the achievements of America. ” Now, 100 years later, the Smithsonian Institution is set to open the National Museum of African American History and Culture. A journey that began against the backdrop of D. W. Griffith’s racist movie, “The Birth of a Nation,” being screened at the White House, will end, four generations later, with an opening ceremony presided over by an African American president and witnessed by luminaries such as Oprah Winfrey and Cicely Tyson, who promote positive images of African Americans on film. That itself is a great story. I wish Brother Fraction were here to see it.

144224,215737,She called the man who sexually assaulted her a rapist. Now he is suing for defamation.,Washington Post,Lindsey Bever,2016-10-03,2016.0,10.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20161004000943/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/10/03/i-felt-re-victimized-woman-sued-for-referring-to-the-man-who-sexually-assaulted-her-as-a-rapist/
","     For four years,    Yee Xiong fought to put it all behind her. The sexual assault. The questions about what role she may have played in it. Two hung juries and, finally, a plea deal that sent her attacker to jail. Just when Xiong thought it was all over, it seems to be starting again. Xiong is now being sued for defamation by her attacker,    Lang Her, who claims that she and her siblings tarnished his reputation when they called him a rapist online in reference to the assault. Xiong’s attorney, McGregor Scott, is set to appear Monday in a Northern California courtroom to try to get it thrown out by citing their First Amendment rights, according to Sacramento Bee. Her, the perpetrator, was not convicted of rape; instead, he pleaded no contest to felony assault and was sentenced in July to one year in jail, according to news reports. “We were shocked, speechless,” Xiong told the Bee about the lawsuit. “Who in their right mind would do this? I felt  . I want to move on with my life and this is still holding me back. ” Her and Xiong’s lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.   [She endured two trials and public shaming, but after four years, her attacker is going to jail]   In July 2012, Her and Xiong, who both grew up in the same Hmong community in Marysville, Calif. not far from Sacramento, were students at the University of California at Davis. Xiong told authorities that after a night of drinking at an   apartment, she fell asleep and later woke up “feeling intense pressure on her lower body and intense pain,” according to court documents cited by the Sacramento Bee at the time. She said her arms were pinned at her sides, and she could not speak  —   but she did not say why. She said Her was having sex with her without her consent. Although Her has continued to deny that he had sex with Xiong, DNA from his semen was found in Xiong during a medical examination, according to the court documents. As The Washington Post’s Peter Holley reported at the time, Xiong said her struggle has not only been about moving past the night she was assaulted but also trying to explain her own actions: Why did she go to his apartment in the first place? Why did she stay after she claimed she was assaulted? And why did she let him drive her home the next morning? Xiong responded in a powerful statement that she read at Her’s July 19 sentencing, saying, “I do not exist for anyone’s entertainment purposes or to fill in anyone’s curiosity. ” I am also not here to explain to you why I was at Lang Her’s apartment in the first place, why I didn’t do anything else other than what I did, and why I didn’t call the police sooner. Even if I did take what people think of as “the right steps,” we’d still be here. The truth is, I shouldn’t owe anyone an explanation! But I’m here. Xiong added that the burden of proof is almost always on the victim, which “further perpetuates our rape culture that continues to excuse rapists for their heinous actions. ” Going over to a friend’s house never justifies someone getting raped. Drinking with friends until drunk never justifies someone getting raped. Sleeping next to a friend in the same room never justifies someone getting raped. And believe me when I say that those who believe that someone’s actions made them deserve rape are cowards and fools  —   just like Lang, including those who have continued to protect him. That woman who was raped in 2012 could have been your daughter, sister, niece, aunt, and cousin.   [‘You took away my worth’: A sexual assault victim’s powerful message to her Stanford attacker]   On July 19, Her was sentenced to one year in jail and five years of probation and ordered to register as a sex offender and receive sex offender counseling, according to reports. That same day, while Xiong and her family were celebrating closure in the case, one of Her’s relatives handed Xiong a defamation claim, stating she and her siblings made “false and defamatory” statements against him on Facebook during his trial, according to the Sacramento Bee. Xiong told the Associated Press that she saw the civil lawsuit as a “slap to the face” and a way for Her to “continue to harass my family and me. ” Although Xiong’s attorneys declined to discuss the Facebook posts with the AP, the Sacramento Bee reported that on May 21, 2015  —   the day Her’s first trial resulted in a hung jury  —   Xiong’s older sister, Ger Xiong, posted several photos of Her on Facebook along with a note saying that “Rapists destroy lives. Rapists hurt all of us, not just their victims. ” Ger Xiong also posted a photo of Her with a message, “We will not be silenced. We will fight for justice against Lang Her, who is a rapist,” which was shared by Xiong and two of her other siblings, according to the Bee. Xiong told the AP that she and her siblings were not trying to tarnish Her’s reputation. However, Eric Rosenberg, an   attorney who has represented clients in similar civil lawsuits, told the AP that defamation in these cases is real. “There is no bigger stain on a person in this culture than being labeled as a sexual assailant, and that’s what they’re labeled as,” he told the news agency, adding: “They can’t get into school, they can’t get into the military  —   a lawsuit’s their only way out. ” For that reason, Laura Dunn, executive director of SurvJustice, a nonprofit that advocates for victims of sexual violence, told the AP that victims should avoid naming their attackers outside of the courtroom. But Emily Austin, from the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault, added that the issue is when the threat of defamation lawsuits keeps victims quiet. “The impact could be, if these become more common, that survivors are going to   reporting, afraid anything they’re saying could be grounds for a lawsuit against them personally,” she told the AP. In Her’s case, legal experts said that despite the fact that Her did not receive a rape conviction, it may be difficult for him to claim defamation since Xiong and her siblings could argue that they were only commenting on a case that had already been widely publicized by the news media. According to the Sacramento Bee: Since the early 1990s, speech protections have been enhanced by the California Legislature because legislators feared that a preponderance of lawsuits were having a chilling effect on free speech. The Legislature created language that allows judges to quickly toss defamation cases if the judges determine that the plaintiff has little chance to win. “A lot of states achieve summary dispositions of cases that can otherwise take up judicial and legal resources,” Lisa Pruitt, a law professor at   told the newspaper. “It’s really hard to win these cases because of speech protections. ” In any case, Xiong said she questions Her’s motivations. “When I saw he was asking for $4 million, I had to laugh,” she told the Bee. “I thought it was a joke. ” Read more: A student’s chilling photos put sexual assault in focus The Swedish Stanford students who rescued an unconscious sexual assault victim speak out ‘A steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action’: Dad defends Stanford sex offender"

","      In the fall of 1976, Fred Trump made a rare visit to a housing complex he owned in Seat Pleasant, Md. For months, Prince George’s County inspectors had complained of broken windows, rotted rain gutters and missing fire extinguishers at the   Gregory Estates. When the problems weren’t fixed,   officials asked Trump to come down and meet in person. The “meeting” however, was brief. As soon as the multimillionaire arrived, he was arrested and  —   to his outrage  —   briefly jailed. The incident came at an awkward time for the Trump family. Fred was accused of subjecting black tenants to poor conditions just a year after settling a lawsuit with the federal government, which alleged that the Trump Organization refused to rent to African Americans.  And his   son was in the middle of an audacious and ultimately unsuccessful bid to construct a $125 million convention center in the nation’s capital. Barely 30 years old, Donald Trump saw opportunity in downtown Washington’s barren lots and   buildings near Union Station. In an interview, Trump told The Washington Post he had no idea his father had been arrested in Prince George’s. But he had no trouble recalling his convention center proposal, which included a luxury hotel in the historic Government Publishing Office. “It would have been great for Washington,” he said in an email. Forty years later, Trump has finally gotten his foothold in the capital with the opening of his glitzy $212 million Trump International Hotel in the Old Post Office Pavilion. And the Republican presidential nominee is trying to claim an even grander address on Pennsylvania Avenue: the White House.  But the seeds of his Washington ambitions can be traced back to 1976, when his convention center proposal fell victim to his strained relationship with African Americans  —   something that has   as he runs for president. “He doesn’t really reach out to black people properly,” said Joseph Searles III, now 74, an African American   player who was one of Trump’s partners in the convention center project.  “Every time we went to a community meeting,” Searles said, “he’d piss off too many people, just like he does now. ” ‘Get me out of jail’      The Washington Post explores the origins of Donald Trump’s transformation from a businessman to political candidate. (McKenna Ewen, Whitney Shefte, Dalton   Washington Post)   In the spring of 1961, when Donald Trump was finishing his freshman year at a military high school in New York, his father purchased Gregory Estates from the Federal Housing Administration. Records show he paid $1. “It was bought at a distress sale,” Donald Trump recalled.  The sprawling,   apartment complex had been built a decade earlier during the postwar boom. When the developer couldn’t keep up with mortgage payments, the FHA took over, then sold the property to Bruche Realty Corp. one of Fred Trump’s many companies. Fred Trump rented the   and   apartments for about $150 a month. Initially, his tenants were poor whites. After the 1968 riots devastated parts of Washington, however, both the District and the surrounding areas began to change. African Americans, many of them middle class, moved into Prince George’s County as whites fled to Montgomery County and other suburbs. By 1970, when Donald began to help manage Gregory Estates, the tenants were predominantly black. With his blond pompadour and Ivy League education, the young Trump stood out in the   apartment project. He would fly down for a week at a time and stay in the model unit that was shown to prospective renters.  In his interview with The Post earlier this year, he remembered collecting rent for his father at Gregory Estates. “That was a dangerous territory,” Trump recalled. “I’d go there sometimes by myself and I’d say, ‘Pop, this is a rough piece of property here.’ ” But Willie Cabbagestalk remembers things differently. “He didn’t collect [expletive],” said Cabbagestalk, 75, who has worked at Gregory Estates, now called Pleasant Homes Apartments, since the mid 1960s. “He gave me orders. ” He agreed with Trump, however, that Gregory Estates rapidly declined in the late 1960s and early 1970s. “It used to be rough here,” Cabbagestalk said. “We had 50 to 60 windows broken per day. ”    The Pleasant Homes Apartments in Seat Pleasant, Md. Formerly known as Gregory Estates, the complex was once owned by Donald Trump’s father. Fred Trump was arrested and briefly jailed in 1976 for failing to fix   violations. (Sarah L.   Washington Post)  By the time inspectors visited in January of 1976, Gregory Estates was falling apart.  When the notoriously frugal Fred Trump failed to pay for repairs by that July, his housing license was revoked, preventing him from signing new leases. The blow to his pocketbook spurred him to action: Trump agreed to fly to Maryland to meet with local officials on Sept. 29, 1976. Instead, he was arrested. Prince George’s County was cracking down on dilapidated housing complexes, but arresting an owner was unusual. “We probably haven’t issued four arrest warrants in the past five years,” Joseph T. Healey, the county’s housing inspector supervisor, told The Post for an article on the arrest. Fred Trump was furious. From his cell, the real estate mogul called Seat Pleasant Mayor Henry T. Arrington and demanded he be released. “Come get me out of jail,” Trump said, according to Arrington. Arrington, now 84, was well aware of the problems at Gregory Estates  —   “It was infested with drugs”  —   but he had never met the landlord. When the mayor told Trump that he had no jurisdiction over the jail, Trump called New York, arranged payment of his $1, 000 bond, and flew home immediately. Irving Eskenazi, a Trump employee, attributed the problems to “a very serious change in the area.   people started moving in. ” Trump, he told The Post at the time, was a “fine gentleman” who “shouldn’t even be going to a project like this. ” And county officials should have known better than to “try and louse around with his reputation. ” Donald Trump, who had risen to president of the Trump Organization, vowed to fight the allegations in court. But his father pleaded no contest to five misdemeanor charges and paid a fine of $3, 640  —   the equivalent of about $15, 400 today.  Fred Trump didn’t waste any time washing his hands of the place. Shortly after his arrest, he hired H. R. Crawford, a former assistant secretary of the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, to manage the property. Trump, Crawford said, handed him the keys and severed his ties to Bruche Realty and Gregory Estates.  “He didn’t want to come back to Prince George’s County ever again,” Crawford, 74, recalled. ‘Trump did not excite anybody ’    On July 7, 1976, Donald Trump, then 30, stood beside a model of the D. C. convention center he hoped to build. (Tom   Washington Post)  On July 7, 1976, Donald Trump stood before D. C. officials and promised to transform the struggling capital with a 1. 8    convention center. “The center will bring in $500 million in new business, and the city will take $45 to $50 million of that in taxes,” the    sharply dressed in a   suit and patterned tie, was quoted by The Post as saying.  For the next year, the young Trump would try to sell the city on his plan. But Trump’s brash personality and    style angered officials and alienated African American residents. In the summer of 1976, both Washington and Donald Trump were new to negotiating. Trump had first gained notoriety by defending his family’s business against federal allegations of racial bias, ultimately settling the case without admitting fault. Then he bought the old Commodore Hotel in Manhattan and turned it into the Grand Hyatt. He was in the midst of convincing New York City officials to build a convention center on land to which he held a lucrative option when he came to the capital to pitch a similar plan. Washington had gained home rule on Christmas Eve in 1973. The city’s first elected mayor, Walter Washington, felt that a new convention center near Mount Vernon Square would lift the District’s economy and spirit. Congress still had to approve the plan, however, and a tense standoff ensued. Lawmakers, led by Sen. Patrick J. Leahy ( ) criticized the proposal as too costly. In stepped The Donald. Trump offered to arrange $125 million in private financing to build a bigger convention center next to Union Station. Trump wasn’t the only millionaire to offer his services. Abe Pollin, owner of the Washington Bullets and Capitals, initially wanted a convention center alongside a sports arena downtown before settling for an arena in Maryland. Home improvement store magnate John W. Hechinger proposed his lumberyard in Northeast Washington as a site. Architect Arthur Cotton Moore even suggested stringing inflatable “helium cells” over RFK Stadium to create a convention center covered by the “world’s first ‘floating roof.’ ” City officials were caught off guard by Trump’s plan, the Washington Star reported. He and his partners briefed the mayor only a few days before bringing the idea before the D. C. Redevelopment Land Agency board. Trump’s surprise proposal came with two catches. Although he would use private financing to build the center  —   which would stretch from Massachusetts Avenue to I Street and North Capitol to Second Street  —   Trump said he was seeking subsidies to meet “a portion of the debt service and carrying charges,” according to The Post. He said the amount would be “$5 to $10 million at the absolute maximum” and would be more than offset by the taxes the city would rake in. In a move foreshadowing his return to the District 40 years later, Trump also wanted permission to transform the historic   Government Publishing Office building into a luxury hotel. But Trump ran into serious headwinds. Unlike in New York, he was relatively unknown in the capital.    Donald J. Trump, already president of the Trump Organization, tried to sell skeptical D. C. officials on a $125 million convention center. (Tom   Washington Post)  “The name Trump did not excite anybody back then,” said Sterling Tucker, the D. C. Council chairman at the time. A bigger hurdle was that the city’s first elected officials were against privately financing the convention center. “We were trying to control our destiny,” recalled Tucker, now 92.  What ultimately killed Trump’s $125 million plan, however, was a public school. After Trump’s July 7 presentation, he was told that he would have to wait while the redevelopment board considered the proposal, including concerns raised by community groups. “This is ridiculous. That’s why Washington doesn’t have a convention center,” Trump responded, according to the Star. When the redevelopment board met again two weeks later, about 50 residents showed up to protest the location of Trump’s proposed convention center. Much of the land was already promised to other things, including Perry Simmons Elementary, they argued. When the board rejected Trump’s plan, they cheered. Three years later, the city began construction on the Washington Convention Center near Mount Vernon Square. Smaller than Trump’s proposal, it opened in 1983 but was quickly dwarfed by competitors. It was demolished in 2004. In an email, Trump said he remembered his convention center idea well, although he “didn’t pursue it heavily. ”  “The project we are opening now is even more exciting,” he added. Trump’s palatial new hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue will hold its formal grand opening just days before the election. He cited it during his second debate with Hillary Clinton as an example of his business acumen, touting the work as “under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. ” But the project has also drawn protests. Dozens gathered outside on Trump International’s first day of operation, chanting: “No Trump, no KKK, no racist USA!” Two weeks ago, a man   “Black Lives Matter” on its entrance. On Thursday, labor activists picketed over stymied efforts to organize workers at a Trump hotel in Las Vegas. “Donald Trump,” they shouted, “has got to go. ”    Chanting, ”Hey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump has got to go,” union workers picket outside the Trump International Hotel over a labor dispute at a Trump property in Las Vegas.

","         A federal judge on Friday ruled that Dylann Roof, the    accused of killing nine parishioners in a Charleston, S. C. church last year, is competent to stand trial. Jury selection will resume in the case on Monday with individual questioning of prospective jurors, the judge said. U. S. District Judge Richard Gergel made the ruling in a   order that kept sealed exactly what he found, a step he said was necessary to make sure Roof gets a fair trial. Hearings on the matter were also conducted in secret. “After carefully considering the record before the Court, the relevant legal standards, and the arguments of counsel, the Court now finds and concludes that the Defendant is competent to stand trial,” Gergel wrote. Roof is charged with federal hate crimes in connection with the June 2015 shooting at the Emanuel AME Church. Prosecutors have alleged he carefully planned the attack, which was motivated by his animosity toward African Americans. In the shooting’s aftermath, authorities said they found a racist manifesto Roof had posted on his website and modified just hours before the attack. The site was filled with racial stereotypes and diatribes against black, Jewish and Hispanic people as well as photos of Roof holding a .  Glock pistol and a Confederate flag. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch has said the “nature of the alleged crime and the resulting harm compelled this decision. ” Jury selection was supposed to have begun in the trial earlier this month, but Gergel suddenly put the proceedings on hold to evaluate Roof’s competence after defense attorneys came to him with some type of evidence that would call into question their client’s ability to understand the proceedings. The judge appointed James C. Ballenger to conduct the review. A determination that Roof is competent means that he understands the nature of the proceedings against him and can assist in his own defense. Roof is also facing state charges in connection with the killings, but that trial also has been delayed because of concerns about competence. A defense attorney for Roof did not return a message seeking comment. A spokeswoman for the U. S. Attorney’s Office in South Carolina declined to comment.

"," Football players at the University of Minnesota ended their   protest Saturday morning and dropped their threat to boycott the team’s postseason bowl game over concerns about the school’s treatment of 10 suspended teammates.   The players made the announcement with Gophers Coach Tracy Claeys and other members of the coaching staff looking on. “After many, many hours of discussion within our team and after speaking with President [Eric] Kaler, it became clear that our original request of having 10 suspensions overturned was not going to happen,” senior wide receiver Drew Wolitarsky said, reading from a prepared statement. Wolitarsky said that the team would immediately resume its preparations for the Holiday Bowl, scheduled to be played Dec. 27 in San Diego.  “This is an educational moment,” Mark Coyle, the school’s athletic director, said Saturday. “The great thing about college campuses is you can have different opinions. You can express those opinions. But you have to be respectful during that process. Again, this is a learning experience for all of us. ”  The players boycotted football activities, including practices, for two days to protest the treatment of the 10 Gophers players who were suspended and face further disciplinary action for their roles in an alleged sexual assault. That discipline followed an investigation by the school’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action into an incident from earlier in the semester. A female student said that as many as a dozen men took part in a sexual assault Sept. 2 at the   apartment of one of the football players, according to police reports. Five Minnesota players told police they had consensual sex with the woman. Though the players ultimately faced no criminal charges, the school inquiry resulted in the recommendation of expulsion for five of the players,   suspensions for four of them and probation for a 10th. All were suspended pending hearings and an appeals process. “We made a   decision,” Kaler said Saturday. “The athletic director made a decision. I supported that decision based on our values and what we think is right. That’s what we did. Part of the consequences of decisions is that sometimes people become unhappy. ” Players learned of the punishments Tuesday and met with athletic department administrators Wednesday. Unhappy with the explanations they had received, players announced a   boycott of all football activities Thursday and skipped practice both that day and Friday.  “We are disappointed at the lack of communication from the administration and their unwillingness to share information about the decision under the cover of student privacy,” Wolitarsky said Saturday. “We also understand that they have requirements that they need to follow about sharing information. Yet at the same time, we observed how our teammates’ names and pictures were shared with the world and their reputations were ruined. ” The players backed away from their initial demands, which included calling for the reinstatement of their teammates and for Kaler and Coyle to be “held accountable for their actions. ” Kaler made clear to them that reinstating the players was not an option.  “One of my jobs as President is to put our institutional values at the forefront of all we do and ensure our actions are aligned with those values,” he said in a statement Friday night. “This principle is far more important than any football game and the University community as a whole, and it is more important than any single athletic team. ” Kaler was apparently prepared for the Gophers to skip the Holiday Bowl, saying that the school would “not change our values or our code of conduct for the sake of a bowl game. ”  The school president also said that the team had declined his initial invitation for a meeting, but the players did finally meet with him and Coyle on Friday night. Kaler said it was a “frank and candid discussion. ” “I listened to their concerns,” he said. “I think I was able to explain our point of view around the actions that we took. ”   Wolitarsky said Saturday that the administration told players their 10 suspended teammates would each receive a fair hearing, “which includes a diverse review panel. ” “I’ve learned a lot from these past couple of days. There are no right choices. There are no decisions that do not affect somebody else,” Wolitarsky said. “This process has been extremely difficult. I’m sure, as you all know, how stressful this has been for everybody involved. ” The Gophers could resume practices immediately. They are scheduled to leave town next week for the Holiday Bowl, in which they will face Washington State.  Wolitarsky said that the entire experience had reinforced what Gopher football meant to the larger community. “As a team, we understand that what has occurred these past few days and playing football for the University of Minnesota is much larger than us,” he said. “So many people before us have given so much here, and this football team  —   so many coaches, staff, administration, professors, alumni, fans and our community have invested heavily in the success of our program. We will not  —   and we recognize we must not  —   let those people down. ” The players said that parts of their initial statement were misconstrued, and Saturday morning they made sure to condemn sexual violence against women. “There is only one acceptable way to treat all women, and that is with the utmost respect at all times,” Wolitarsky said.
