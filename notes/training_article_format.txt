On the first line of each training article .txt file, we want the following data:

(news publication), bias, truthfulness, (country code) 

Use the following constants to represent bias and truthfulness:

bias = [extreme_left|left|left_center|least_biased|right_center|right|extreme_right]
truthfulness = [very_low|low|mixed|mostly_factual|high|very_high]

After the first line, we want a blank line. Then, we want the entire body of the training article.

For example:

=== beginning of .txt file ===
New York Times, left_center, high, USA

(Article text begins here)
.
.
.
=== end of .txt file ===

Another example (CSV spacing needs to be consistent!):

=== beginning of another .txt file ===
Fox News, right, mixed, USA

(Article text begins here)
.
.
.
=== end of another .txt file ===

Obviously, there will be a one to one relationship between training articles and .txt files.
